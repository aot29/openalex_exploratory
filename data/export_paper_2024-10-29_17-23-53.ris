AB  - Academics (should) strive to submit to journals which are academically sound and scholarly. To achieve this, they could either submit to journals that appear exclusively on safelists (occasionally referred to as whitelists, although this term tends to be avoided), or avoid submitting to journals on watchlists (occasionally referred to as blacklists, although this term tends to be avoided). The most well-known of these lists was curated by Jeffrey Beall. Beall’s Lists (there are two, one for stand-alone journals and one for publishers) were taken offline by Beall himself in January 2017. Prior to 2017, Beall’s Lists were widely cited and utilized, including to make quantitative claims about scholarly publishing. Even after Beall’s Lists became obsolete (they have not been maintained for the past six years), they continue to be widely cited and used. This paper argues that the use of Beall’s Lists, pre- and post-2017, may constitute a methodological error and, even if papers carry a disclaimer or limitations section noting this weakness, their conclusions cannot always be relied upon. This paper also argues for the need to conduct a detailed post-publication assessment of reports in the literature that used Beall’s Lists to validate their findings and conclusions, assuming that it becomes accepted that Beall’s Lists are not a reliable resource for scientific investigation. Finally, this paper contends that any papers that have identified methodological errors should be corrected. Several lists that were cloned from Beall’s Lists have also emerged and are also being cited. These should also be included in any post-publication investigation that is conducted.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper briefly describes the rapidly changing research evaluation and funding landscape in Australian universities, specifically in relation to open access and institutional repositories. Recent announcements indicate that funding and evaluation bodies are becoming increasingly concerned that publicly funded research be made publicly available. The paper then reports a survey of all levels of academic staff plus research students at one Australian university, conducted in May 2006, prior to the introduction of an institutional repository. The survey, in line with previously reported surveys, found that while there was a high level of engagement with scholarly publishing, there was a low level of awareness of, or concern with, either open access (‘green’ or ‘gold’) or the roles repositories can play in increasing accessibility of research. Practically, this indicates that much work needs to be done within this university to increase knowledge of, and change behaviours with regard to, open access and repositories if the university and its academics are to make the most of new funding requirements and research evaluation processes.

AB  - ABSTRACT The job titles and career paths of people transitioning between academia and scholarly publishing, and of those who are progressing within their publishing careers, has been little studied and lacks accepted frameworks, ‘route‐maps’, and taxonomies. Much of the work done to date provides merely a ‘snapshot’ of the current demographics of the publishing workforce at particular moment, and tends not to offer insight into pathways, trajectories, or momentum. This preliminary survey, involving around 150 scholarly publishers, reveals insights into job titles, progressions, and transitions, and exposes some of the reasons for transitions between academia and publishing. The analysis suggests that these transitions and career paths can be systematically studied and documented, for use both by individuals considering their own careers, and by planners and managers in academic institutions and scholarly publishing organizations.

AB  - While there is significant progress with policy and a lively debate regarding the potential impact of open access publishing, few studies have examined academics' behavior and attitudes to open access publishing (OAP) in scholarly journals. This article seeks to address this gap through an international and interdisciplinary survey of academics. Issues covered include: use of and intentions regarding OAP, and perceptions regarding advantages and disadvantages of OAP, journal article publication services, peer review, and reuse. Despite reporting engagement in OAP, academics were unsure about their future intentions regarding OAP. Broadly, academics identified the potential for wider circulation as the key advantage of OAP, and were more positive about its benefits than they were negative about its disadvantages. As regards services, rigorous peer review, followed by rapid publication were most valued. Academics reported strong views on reuse of their work; they were relatively happy with noncommercial reuse, but not in favor of commercial reuse, adaptations, and inclusion in anthologies. Comparing science, technology, and medicine with arts, humanities, and social sciences showed a significant difference in attitude on a number of questions, but, in general, the effect size was small, suggesting that attitudes are relatively consistent across the academic community.

AB  - The disciplinary culture theory presumes that if a scholar has been familiar with self-archiving through an existing subject-based repository, this scholar will be more enthusiastic about contributing his/her research to an institutional repository than one who has not had the experience. To test the theory, this article examines self-archiving practices of a group of physicists in both a subject repository and an institutional repository. It does not find a correlation between a disciplinary culture and self-archiving practices.

AB  - Summary The issue of commercial advertising in academic journals is complex and controversial. It is complex because its implications reveal deeply embedded conceptions of the academy and the marketplace both traditionally and in this historical moment. It is controversial because those same implications promise that change is what this historical moment foreshadows, and change has a way of impacting the norms of tradition. The question then becomes, is there a way to synthesize these conceptions of the academy and the marketplace, perhaps in the form of unobtrusive advertising? This article considers the notion of additive change, developed by Ronald C. Arnett and Pat Arneson, as a concept for thinking through the serials crisis in academia and the marketplace.

AB  - With increasing volumes of research output and the continued emergence of new publishing venues, scholarly publishing has become a crowded landscape. This study analyses the factors that influence LIS authors when selecting a journal for submission, and in particular the significance of open access (OA) options and bibliometric indicators in this decision-making process. An online questionnaire with Likert scales was used to collect and rank the preferences and attitudes of LIS professionals. As part of the analysis, two separate sub-groups were examined using inferential statistical tests to explore if the research-practice divide so often cited in the LIS literature is also replicated in journal selection. It is concluded that choosing a journal for LIS research is a complex decision for both faculty members and librarians. Whilst some commonality exists between both groups, many variables show evidence of a divide in practices and preferences in consonance with the existing research.

AB  - Scientific journal publishers have rapidly converted during the past 25 years to predominantly electronic dissemination, but the reader-pays business model continues to dominate the market. Open Access (OA) publishing, where the articles are freely readable on the net, has slowly increased its market share to near 20 percent but has failed to fulfill the visions of rapid proliferation predicted by many early proponents. The growth of OA has also been very uneven across fields of science. We report market shares of open access in 18 Scopus-indexed disciplines ranging from 27 percent (agriculture) to 7 percent (business). The differences become far more pronounced for journals published in the four countries that dominate commercial scholarly publishing (US, UK, Germany, and the Netherlands). We present contrasting developments within six academic disciplines. Availability of funding to pay publication charges, pressure from research funding agencies, and the diversity of discipline-specific research communication cultures arise as potential explanations for the observed differences.

AB  - Scholarly publishing has undergone major changes over the past 50 years. Funder mandates and organisational reporting obligations have heralded the creation of open access repositories, such as institutional and subject repositories. This research draws upon the US PubMed Central (PMC) and Europe PMC, also known as PMC International, as a role model to inform the concept and opportunity for an Australasia open access biomedical repository. PMC International is a leader in making citations and research output, which link to research data, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). As repositories approach two decades of development, this paper reports on the potential for an Australasia open access biomedical repository through a knowledge management lens and explores the opportunities for future open access biomedical repositories.

It uses the OAPEN Library and the <em>Directory of Open Access Books</em> (DOAB) to actively disseminate and promote its peer-reviewed OA monographs. The OAPEN Library targets both individual readers and academic libraries. On top of that, books with a 'free to read' licence are further promoted via DOAB. AUP also co-operates with the IMISCOE research networks to promote their books. While the online usage of OA books is rising, AUP has not found evidence that open access harms sales of printed editions.

AB  - This article presents an overview of a strategic partnership undertaken by the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) and the Érudit Consortium (Érudit) to support the move towards open access for Canadian francophone scholarly journals. CRKN and Érudit have had a relationship through a traditional commercial subscription model since 2008. In 2014, the two organizations recognized the need for a new relationship that would address two major challenges: the fragility of the Canadian not-for-profit scholarly publishing environment and the increasing pressure from libraries and funding agencies for scholarly journals to move towards open access. Érudit and CRKN have worked collaboratively to create an innovative partnership, which provides a framework for a new relationship between publishers and libraries, and helps to provide financial support to Canadian publishers during the transition to a fully open access model. This paper presents the perspectives of the two organizations involved in the partnership by outlining the common goals, objectives, and strategy, as well as the differing needs and perspectives of libraries and publishers. It summarizes the key aspects of the partnership as well as the challenges faced. Through this case study, the authors demonstrate how university libraries can play an active role in working with journals to support open access to research.&nbsp

AB  - I recently revisited an insightful piece of writing that got me thinking.This article talks about how even though the peer review process underlies all of science, it is understudied and its defects are more prominent than its merits.This article also mentions how peer review is often famously compared with democracy-as "a system full of problems but the least bad we have". [1]This piece was published in 2006.Today, over 15 years later, peer review continues to occupy an important place in research, especially in grant funding and journal publishing.][5] While there are several published works that delve into the workings of the peer review process, its challenges, advantages, and demerits, two global events that have opened up unlimited conversations about peer review among the scholarly publishing community are the International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication [6] and Peer Review Week. [7]If you are unfamiliar with these events, here's a quick primer.

AB  - The study documents the growth in the number of journals and articles along with the increase in normalized citation rates of open access (OA) journals listed in the Scopus bibliographic database between 1999 and 2010. Longitudinal statistics on growth in journals/articles and citation rates are broken down by funding model, discipline, and whether the journal was launched or had converted to OA. The data were retrieved from the websites of SCIMago Journal and Country Rank (journal/article counts), JournalM3trics (SNIP2 values), Scopus (journal discipline) and Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) (OA and funding status). OA journals/articles have grown much faster than subscription journals but still make up less that 12% of the journals in Scopus. Two-year citation averages for journals funded by Article Processing Charges (APCs) have reached the same level as subscription journals. Citation averages of OA journals funded by other means continue to lag well behind OA journals funded by APCs and subscription journals. We hypothesize this is less an issue of quality than due to the fact that such journals are commonly published in languages other than English and tend to be located outside the four major publishing countries.

AB  - The quality and impact of scholarly articles are traditionally evaluated using metrics that put citation counts at the center. In the era of digitization, advanced online platforms and social media have transformed the dissemination of scientific information results and introduced new metrics for evaluating the influence of scholarly outputs and planning research studies. Alternative metrics (altmetrics) have emerged as tools for immediate measuring of scholarly outputs upon their online publication and dissemination through numerous online platforms, including social media channels. The Altmetrtic Attention Score by Altmetric.com has gained its global importance as an integral indicator for evaluation of constantly changing societal influence of individual articles. To a large extent, this and other social media metrics complement established citation metrics, allowing to visualize and predict implications at early stages of post-publication promotion. This article overviews characterstics of various altmetric tools and their growing roles for planning and evaluating scientific research.

AB  - More than 250 authors at Utah State University published an Open Access (OA) article in 2016. Analysis of survey results and publication data from Scopus suggests that the following factors led authors to choose OA venues: ability to pay publishing charges, disciplinary colleagues' positive attitudes toward OA, and personal feelings such as altruism and desire to reach a wide audience. Tenure status was not an apparent factor. This article adds to the body of literature on author motivations and can inform library outreach and marketing efforts, the creation of new publishing models, and the conversation about the larger scholarly publishing landscape.

AU  - Tomlin, Patrick
C1  - Virginia Tech University
AB  - Recent events suggest that open access has gained new momentum in the humanities, but the slow and uneven development of open-access initiatives in humanist fields continues to hinder the consolidation of efforts across the university. Although various studies have traced the general origins of the humanities’ reticence to embrace open access, few have actually considered the scholarly practices and disciplinary priorities that shape a discipline’s adoption of its principles. This article examines the emergence, potential and actualized, of open access in art history. Part case study, part conceptual mapping, the discussion is framed within the context of three interlocking dynamics: the present state of academic publishing in art history; the dominance of the journal and self-archiving repository within open-access models of scholarly production; and the unique roles played by copyright and permissions in art historical scholarship. It is hoped that tracing the discipline-specific configuration of research provides a first step toward both investigating the identity that open access might assume within the humanities, from discipline to discipline, and explaining how and why it might allow scholars to better serve themselves and their audiences.&#x0D; &#x0D;

AB  - Small academic publishers are commonly associated with universities, learned societies, or scientific groups with shared research agendas, differing from their larger commercial counterparts. This research explores specific bibliometric data to highlight differences and similarities of citation coverage for small journals indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The paper looks at small journals in open access format in comparison to larger, non-open access journals. The goal is to problematize and assess the visibility and impact of the literature being cited in indexed and non-indexed journals and discuss the role of small open access journals as bridges for field-specific (usually non-indexed) and highly cited (mostly indexed) literature in these databases. This approach sheds light into the scholarly, publishing practices of different academic fields and disciplines.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to show that the journal impact factor (IF) is not able to reflect the full impact of scholarly journals and provides an overview of alternative and complementary methods in journal evaluation. Design/methodology/approach – Aslib Proceedings (AP) is exemplarily analyzed with a set of indicators from five dimensions of journal evaluation, i.e. journal output, content, perception and usage, citations and management to accurately reflect its various strengths and weaknesses beyond the IF. Findings – AP has become more international in terms of authors and more diverse regarding its topics. Citation impact is generally low and, with the exception of a special issue on blogs, remains world average. However, an evaluation of downloads and Mendeley readers reveals that the journal is an important source of information for professionals and students and certain topics are frequently read but not cited. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited to one journal. Practical implications – An overview of various indicators and methods is provided that can be applied in the quantitative evaluation of scholarly journals (and also to articles, authors and institutions). Originality/value – After a publication history of more than 60 years, this analysis takes stock of AP, highlighting strengths and weaknesses and developments over time. The case study provides an example and overview of the possibilities of multidimensional journal evaluation.

AB  - The commitment to Open Access (OA) movement has started revolutionising the outline of conventional scholarly publishing practices and welcoming the new wind to scientific research across the world. Motivating by the changing scenario, the study strives to analyse OA uptake by the Indian academic and research institutions concerning their research productivity. Publication data of 36 universities have been retrieved from the 2020 record of CWTS Leiden Ranking database. Findings of the study show that around 23 per cent of all publications of these universities are openly accessible, and their median OA publications proportion is much lower (around half) than the median measure of universities worldwide (43 %). ‘Green OA’ reserved the first place with 17 per cent of occurrence, and Biomedical and Health Sciences have achieved the highest median (34.37 %). The study concludes with a vision towards increasing the global collaboration of the academic institutions regarding OA following the account of the Indian achievements.

AB  - Background: Although Turkey publishes more than 3000 peer-reviewed scientific journals, fewer than 5% of them are covered by major indexing databases, and only 1 of the 10 scientific journals published by Trakya University (Turkey) is among those quality journals. In November 2017, Trakya University organized a workshop titled &amp;lsquo;Increasing the quality of academic journals at Trakya University&amp;rsquo;, the ultimate goal of which was to bring together all stakeholders in the process of academic publishing, to review the criteria of publishing quality, and to recommend measures to enhance the quality of academic journals published from Turkey.&amp;nbsp; Objectives: To review the current status of academic journals published by Trakya University in terms of international publishing standards, to devise measures to enhance their quality, and also to help other journals do the same.&amp;nbsp; Methods: Information was collected from the websites of 10 academic journals pub-lished by Trakya University in the fields of natural, medical, and social sciences to assess the extent to which each journal met a set of criteria defining quality academic publishing. These journals were then compared in terms of their success in meeting those criteria. Results: No single measure can improve the quality of all the ten journals published by Trakya University. Balkan Medical Journal topped the list in that it satisfied nearly all the criteria whereas the journals that met the fewest criteria were Trakya University Journal of Economics and Administrative Sciences Faculty, Trakya University Journal of Faculty of Letters , and Journal of Balkan Libraries Union . Timeliness in ensuring ethical standards was the criterion most often met by the journals, but all 10 failed to meet the criteria related to data accessibility and good reporting guidelines. Of the 8 crite-ria related to fairness of the blind-review processes, all 10 met 6 but none met all 8. In terms of transparency and implementation of best practices, the highest compliance was in terms of the criteria related to the name of the journal, its governing body, and archiving, but no journal made any effort to market itself, that is, to expand its circulation. Conclusions: The strengths and weaknesses of each journal with reference to the quality of academic publishing were highlighted. The method described in the paper can also be used for evaluating other journals.

AB  - Understanding a country's scientific situation is essential for any country. Common indicators for measuring a country's scientific capability are the number of publications and citations. In this study, we design a new method, the citation induced scientific capability identification (CISCI) method, to measure a country's scientific capability from the perspective of the scientific roles the country undertakes in scientific research. Then, we employ this method to analyze countries' scientific capability based on downloaded citation data in the field of economics and business. Finally, we check the applicability of our designed method and explore countries' scientific capability in the accounting and physics disciplines. The results show that the scientific capability of 158 countries has been changing for many years. Every country has different scientific capabilities in different scientific roles, and China's scientific capability has improved dramatically. The CISCI method is applicable for analyzing scientific capability in scientific research.

AB  - The introduction of the internet has revolutionized the dissemination and assessment of research outputs with renewed emphasis on the impact of scholarly publications. The purpose of this study was to measure scholarly presence and citation impact of research scientists of the Building and Road Research Institute (CSIR-BRRI) on the internet. Bibliometrics was employed as a quantitative research method for this study using Google Scholar. The results showed that majority (77.5%) of scientists had at least one scholarly reference on the internet. It also found that, almost all (96.5%) scientists who had scholarly works online showed affiliation to the CSIR-BRRI. Again, it was observed that most mentions/hits were journal publications (59%) followed by thesis (35%). However, the study found that there was a weak positive relationship between number of journal articles and citations online, a clear indication that a web presence does not automatically reflect the usefulness of a scholarly output. It is recommended that scientists identify and research into globally relevant topics and also publish in reputable journals to enhance their visibility.

AB  - Scientific journals play an important role in academic information exchange and their assessment is of interest to science authorities, editors and researchers. The assessment of journals is of particular interest to South African authorities as the country’s universities are partially funded according to the number of publications they produce in accredited journals, such as the Thomson Reuters indexed journals. Scientific publishing in South Africa has experienced a revolution during the last 10 years. Our objective here is to report the performance of the country’s journals during 2009 and 2010 according to a number of metrics (i.e. impact factors, Eigenfactors® and the international character of editorial boards); to identify and compare the impact of the South African journals that have been recently added to the Thomson Reuters' Journal Citation Reports®; and to elaborate on issues related to science policy.

AB  - Open access (OA) is a revolutionary way of providing access to the scholarly journal literature made possible by the Internet. The primary aim of this study was to measure the volume of scientific articles published in full immediate OA journals from 2000 to 2011, while observing longitudinal internal shifts in the structure of OA publishing concerning revenue models, publisher types and relative distribution among scientific disciplines. The secondary aim was to measure the share of OA articles of all journal articles, including articles made OA by publishers with a delay and individual author-paid OA articles in subscription journals (hybrid OA), as these subsets of OA publishing have mostly been ignored in previous studies.Stratified random sampling of journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals (n = 787) was performed. The annual publication volumes spanning 2000 to 2011 were retrieved from major publication indexes and through manual data collection.An estimated 340,000 articles were published by 6,713 full immediate OA journals during 2011. OA journals requiring article-processing charges have become increasingly common, publishing 166,700 articles in 2011 (49% of all OA articles). This growth is related to the growth of commercial publishers, who, despite only a marginal presence a decade ago, have grown to become key actors on the OA scene, responsible for 120,000 of the articles published in 2011. Publication volume has grown within all major scientific disciplines, however, biomedicine has seen a particularly rapid 16-fold growth between 2000 (7,400 articles) and 2011 (120,900 articles). Over the past decade, OA journal publishing has steadily increased its relative share of all scholarly journal articles by about 1% annually. Approximately 17% of the 1.66 million articles published during 2011 and indexed in the most comprehensive article-level index of scholarly articles (Scopus) are available OA through journal publishers, most articles immediately (12%) but some within 12 months of publication (5%).OA journal publishing is disrupting the dominant subscription-based model of scientific publishing, having rapidly grown in relative annual share of published journal articles during the last decade.

Widely viewed as the “gold standard,” it is considered a requirement for affirming validity and quality, as well as for codifying disciplinary boundaries. As journal editor Richard Smith vividly recalled: “It is the method by which grants are allocated, papers published, academics promoted, and Nobel prizes won. … When something is peer reviewed it is in some sense blessed.”

AB  - Predatory journals have arisen as a significant problem within scholarly literature and efforts to raise awareness about them have focused on researchers looking to publish their work. Because health professionals use scholarly literature to inform their practice, develop policy, and conduct their own research, they should be familiar with the harmfulness of predatory journals. This paper describes an education session delivered to health professionals throughout the province of X. Developed in response to health professionals’ low awareness of predatory journals, it was designed to raise awareness and to provide tools and techniques to critically appraise the scholarly literature.

VL  - 30
AU  - Etkin, Adam
C1  - (Pace University)
AB  - This paper will propose a new system that produces a metric that is an indicator of the level of peer review conducted prior to the publication of scholarly material. A mathematical algorithm which incorporates weighted values of the roles within the peer review process is created. The h-index, which is a value that "measures the productivity and impact of a scientist or scholar," is also incorporated. Each round of review is weighted using the square root as later rounds of peer review are often less rigorous than earlier rounds. Once a paper is accepted the calculation is conducted and a "peer review evaluation" metric, or "Peer Review Evaluation Score" (pre-SCORE) is available. It is clear that such a metric would prove beneficial to all engaged parties (authors, publishers, readers, libraries). Authors will know that their work is being evaluated by a trustworthy publication and by experts in their field. Legitimate, ethical publishers will be recognized as such. Readers would have the ability to filter out material which was not properly vetted, and libraries/consortia would have further assurance that their limited funds are spent wisely. Future studies to see if there is a correlation between the pre-SCORE and Impact Factor or highly cited material is possible. The proposed metric would be one more tool available to aid in the discovery of quality published research.

AB  - This paper investigates the use of traditional and altmetrics indicators to present a comprehensive study on the evaluation of academic monographs in the field of library and information studies. The research analyzes a dataset of 116 monographs published in the last five years, which are obtained from the Dimensions platform. Traditional citation counts were extracted from Dimensions, whereas altmetrics indicators were collected using API from Altmetric.com. This study investigates the relationship between traditional and altmetrics indicators and finds that altmetrics indicators measure the social impact of monographs, whereas traditional citation indicators measure the academic impact. Moreover, the study reveals that open access (OA) books are more likely to attract altmetrics indicators. This research demonstrates that altmetrics indicators can act as an insightful supplement to traditional citation-based indicators for evaluating academic monographs and further highlights the significance of the Dimensions platform for conducting academic book evaluations. Furthermore, this study provides empirical evidence on the complementarity of traditional and altmetrics indicators in evaluating academic monographs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This exploratory study was intended to shed light on Canadian academics’ participation in, knowledge of and attitudes towards Open Access (OA) journal publishing. The primary aim of the study was to inform the authors’ schools’ educational and outreach efforts to faculty regarding OA publishing. The survey was conducted at two Canadian comprehensive universities: Brock University (St. Catharines, Ontario) and Wilfrid Laurier University (Waterloo, Ontario) in 2014. METHODS: A Web-based survey was distributed to faculty at each university. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. LIMITATIONS: Despite the excellent response rates, the results are not generalizable beyond these two institutions. RESULTS: The Brock response rate was 38 percent; the Laurier response rate was 23 percent from full-time faculty and five percent from part-time faculty. Brock and Laurier faculty members share common characteristics in both their publishing practices and attitudes towards OA. Science/health science researchers were the most positive about OA journal publishing; arts and humanities and social sciences respondents were more mixed in their perceptions; business participants were the least positive. Their concerns focused on OA journal quality and associated costs. CONCLUSION: While most survey respondents agreed that publicly available research is generally a good thing, this study has clearly identified obstacles that prevent faculty’s positive attitudes towards OA from translating into open publishing practices.&#x0D; INTRODUCTION : Cette étude exploratoire tente de mieux comprendre la participation, les connaissances et les attitudes des universitaires canadiens envers la publication en libre accès. Le but premier de cette étude est d’éclairer les campagnes éducatives et de sensibilisation concernant la publication en libre accès auprès des institutions des auteurs. Un sondage a été mené en 2014 à deux universités à vocation générale canadiennes : Brock University (St. Catherine, Ontario) et Wilfrid Laurier University (Waterloo, Ontario). MÉTHODES : Un sondage en ligne a été envoyé au corps professoral de chaque université. Les données ont été analysées à l’aide de statistiques descriptives. LIMITES : Malgré l’excellent taux de réponse, les résultats ne peuvent être généralisés au-delà des deux universités. RÉSULTATS : Le taux de réponse de Brock était de 38%; celui de Laurier était de 23% pour les professeurs à temps plein et 5% pour les professeurs à temps partiel. Les professeurs des deux universités partagent quelques caractéristiques quant à leurs pratiques et attitudes envers le libre accès. Les chercheurs en médecine et en sciences de la santé étaient les plus positifs envers la publication dans des revues en libre accès; les répondants des arts, sciences humaines et sciences sociales avaient des opinions mixtes; les participants en gestion étaient les moins positifs. Leurs inquiétudes portaient sur la qualité des revues en libre accès et les coûts associés. CONCLUSION : Malgré le fait que la plupart des répondants croient qu’il est bon que la recherche soit disponible au grand public, cette étude identifie clairement des obstacles qui empêchent les professeurs de passer d’attitudes positives envers le libre accès à des pratiques concrètes de publication ouverte.

AB  - The economy of open access (OA) publishing has been a topic of intensive research over the last two decades. Dichotomies between the so-called 'green' and 'gold' models, or between fee-based and non-fee-based gold models, the latter known as the diamond model, have been addressed from diverse perspectives. However, some critical insights that would enable a thorough understanding of publishers’ and editors’ decision-making and provide a foundation for developing future evidence-based public policies are still missing.In recent years, more importance has been given to the diamond OA model, and the European research area has recognized its potential to bring change and possibly transform the scholarly publishing landscape. The 2021 EC-funded OA Diamond Journals Study (Bosman et al., 2021) reveals that while Europe is rich in OA Diamond journals, they are far from all being included in the DOAJ, nor are they equally distributed across scholarly disciplines and European regions. The study indicates the dominance of large commercial and APC-based publishers in Western Europe contrasted to the prevalence of smaller, diamond OA publishers in Central and Eastern Europe. Yet, subsequent research by Laakso and Multas (2023) shows that such a distribution across European regions could oversimplify a more diverse landscape. Their bibliometric-based analysis indicates that within regions, countries can vary significantly in their publishing ecosystems, based on several factors: the type (and size) of dominant publishers, the availability of country-level public funding mechanisms for scholarly journals, and the availability of common publishing infrastructures. There are examples of countries from different European regions that appear to be successful in building a thriving and sustainable national diamond publishing ecosystem. However, some publishers adopt an APC-based business model even in such predominantly diamond ecosystems. Our study will be twofold: a comparative investigation will establish the share of APC journals in several dominantly diamond countries: Croatia, Finland, France, Norway, Serbia, and Spain. Although limited in geographical scope, the intended sample will strive for complete coverage of OA journals: authors from each country will provide comprehensive national addenda to DOAJ lists. The publicly available information on the websites of all identified OA journals issued by the publishers located in the countries mentioned above will be inspected for evidence of APC schemes (any fees or charges required of authors or their institutions for submitting or publishing a paper in a journal). The study will address the following research questions: 1. What is the share of journals charging APCs at the time of research (among all OA journals in the country, and especially among journals receiving public subsidies, if there are such subsidies available)?; 2. What is the range, median and mode of APC costs?; 3. Is the existence of APCs and their cost related to the type of a journal publisher or owner, the scholarly discipline, or the fact that the journal is indexed inestablished international indices and databases?The insight into the incidence of APC-based journals and the context in which they are introduced will be complemented with a qualitative analysis of APC descriptions. This is expected to reveal some of the reasons for their introduction and possibly show that smaller publishers could resort to some local and nonstandard mechanisms. It will answer additional research questions: 4. Are there any specificities of the APC mechanisms among the analysed journals (waivers, discounts, membership fees, etc.)?, and 5. How transparent are journals about their APCs? (What are the terms used for APCs in different languages? Are they listed in their DOAJ records? Is it explained what they are charged for and how the funds are used?).The results are expected to deepen the existing knowledge about the diversity and sustainability of OA ecosystems.

AB  - Abstract A continued lack of clarity persists because academics, policymakers, and other interested parties are unable to clearly define what is a “predatory” journal or publisher, and a potentially wide gray zone exists there. In this perspective, we argue that journals should be evaluated on a continuum, and not just in two shades, black and white. Since evaluations about what might constitute “predatory” are made by humans, the psychological decision-making system that determines them may induce biases. Considering such human psychological characteristics might shed light on the deterministic criteria that have been used, and continue to be used, to classify a journal or publisher as “predatory”, and perhaps, bring additional clarity to this discussion. Better methods of journal evaluation can be obtained when the factors that polarize journal evaluations are identified. As one example, we need to move away from simply using whitelists and blacklists and educate individual researchers about how to evaluate journals. This paper serves as an educational tool by providing more clarity about the “gray” publishing zone, and argues that currently available qualitative and quantitative systems should be fused to deterministically appreciate the zonation of white, gray and black journals, so as to possibly reduce or eliminate the influence of cognitive or “perception” bias from the “predatory” publishing debate.

AB  - Predatory journals and publishers are a growing concern in the scholarly publishing arena. As one type of attempt to address this increasingly important issue, numerous individuals, associations, and companies have begun curating journal watchlists or journal safelists. This study uses a qualitative content analysis to explore the inclusion/exclusion criteria stated by scholarly publishing journal watchlists and safelists to better understand the content of these lists, as well as the larger controversies that continue to surround the phenomenon that has come to be known as predatory publishing. Four watchlists and ten safelists were analyzed through an examination of their published mission statements and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Notable differences that emerged include the remaining influence of librarian Jeffrey Beall in the watchlists, and the explicit disavowal of his methods for the safelists, along with a growing recognition that the “list” approach may not fully address systemic aspects of predatory publishing that go beyond the individual author's ethical decision-making agency.

AB  - This study aims to reveal the essence a group of health sciences academics’ experience in producing scholarly publications.&#x0D; In this study conducted with the qualitative phenomenological approach, a set of predetermined criteria were used to select the participants for inclusion in the study group. Thus, the criterion-based sampling method, one of the purposive sampling methods, was used in this study. A semi-structured interview form prepared by the researchers was used as a data collection tool. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with the participants. Upon observing data saturation, the data collection process was ended. 12 academics were included in this study. After the interview records were transcribed by the researchers, they were all transferred to the MAXQDA 2022 program, through which coding and thematic analyses were performed.&#x0D; Regarding the scholarly publication process, the themes titled as "authoring", "peer reviewing", "editing",n"publication ethics", "dissatisfaction," and "suggestions" emerged in the analysis of the data. &#x0D; The results obtained in this research render academics’ experiences in the publication processes visible. Thus, it enables publication integrity assessment by focusing on the three important agents of the scholarly publication process: the author, reviewer, and the editor. &#x0D; Reviewing the related literature revealed very few studies on publication processes of health sciences academics’. Discussing and revealing the experiences of academics related to the publication process is necessary to increase the transparency and quality of this process. Thus, this study can serve as a guide for future studies.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution in terms of shares of scholarly book publications in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in five European countries, i.e. Flanders (Belgium), Finland, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. In addition to aggregate results for the whole of the social sciences and the humanities, the authors focus on two well-established fields, namely, economics &amp; business and history. Design/methodology/approach Comprehensive coverage databases of SSH scholarly output have been set up in Flanders (VABB-SHW), Finland (VIRTA), Norway (NSI), Poland (PBN) and Slovenia (COBISS). These systems allow to trace the shares of monographs and book chapters among the total volume of scholarly publications in each of these countries. Findings As expected, the shares of scholarly monographs and book chapters in the humanities and in the social sciences differ considerably between fields of science and between the five countries studied. In economics &amp; business and in history, the results show similar field-based variations as well as country variations. Most year-to-year and overall variation is rather limited. The data presented illustrate that book publishing is not disappearing from an SSH. Research limitations/implications The results presented in this paper illustrate that the polish scholarly evaluation system has influenced scholarly publication patterns considerably, while in the other countries the variations are manifested only slightly. The authors conclude that generalizations like “performance-based research funding systems (PRFS) are bad for book publishing” are flawed. Research evaluation systems need to take book publishing fully into account because of the crucial epistemic and social roles it serves in an SSH. Originality/value The authors present data on monographs and book chapters from five comprehensive coverage databases in Europe and analyze the data in view of the debates regarding the perceived detrimental effects of research evaluation systems on scholarly book publishing. The authors show that there is little reason to suspect a dramatic decline of scholarly book publishing in an SSH.

TI  - A reflection on Springer Nature’s current editorial policies related to “predatory” journals and references
IS  - 2
VL  - 8
AU  - da Silva, J.
C1  - Independent researcher
AB  - Despite its prominent position as one of the leading for-profit scholarly publishers of subscription and open access (OA) journals, and its membership of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA), Springer Nature can be criticized for taking a vague approach in its editorial policies pertaining to “predatory” publishing. While cautioning authors and/or editors about the citation of papers that are published in “predatory” journals, the advice presented in the policies itself is flawed due its limitation to OA journals – thus apparently excluding the possibility that subscription journals might also be “predatory” and failing to specify precisely which journals authors and editors should be careful of, i.e., no source for the “predatory” definition of OA journals is indicated. Moreover, this vague set of policies does not have a publication date, nor is any authorship specified. The opacity of these aspects of these editorial policies limits their usefulness and weakens their objectives, namely in ostensibly offering scholarly advice to protect editors and authors. I argue that the Springer Nature policies pertaining to “predatory” publishing as they currently stand are not useful, and if left unchanged, can be a source of confusion or error for authors and editors of Springer Nature journals. In this connection, the identified risk is that if the poor advice indicated in those policies is heeded, it may encourage abuse, insults and/or indiscriminate profiling of academics, including those associated with Springer Nature journals. While assuming Springer Nature’s genuine intention to alert editors and authors against citing papers published in suspect scholarly venues, I argue that this editorial set of policies should either be rewritten to rely on clearer parameters, including a definitive list of journals for which “predatory” criteria have been defined, or abandoned as they are overly broad. The criticism is aimed at stimulating a discussion among other editors and publishers, especially COPE members.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines journal publications in the field of library and information science (LIS) to assess the level of internationalization in their publications authorship pattern. The international production and communication of scholarly knowledge is crucial to the growth of a discipline. Recent advancement in communication technology and the rise of globalization have led to the hope of a more balanced flow of scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, scholars also cautioned the possibility of a global digital divide and a widening knowledge gap. This study analyzed the geographical affiliations of authors in 20 international LIS journals to track the longitudinal changes in LIS authorship pattern. Findings suggest an increase in the internationalization of LIS authorships over the years. However, the LIS authorship distribution was still highly uneven in 2003 (Gini coefficient = 0.95). Economic power is still found to be a moderate predictor of publication performance. The findings of this study suggest that, at the moment of the writing, there is still room for the LIS field to be more internationalized. Further research is needed to identify the barriers in international scholarly communication and to explore the implications of such a communication pattern on scientific development and global equality.

AB  - Abstract This study uses content-based citation analysis to move beyond the simplified classification of predatory journals. We present that, when we analyze papers not only in terms of the quantity of their citations but also the content of these citations, we are able to show the various roles played by papers published in journals accused of being predatory. To accomplish this, we analyzed the content of 9,995 citances (i.e., citation sentences) from 6,706 papers indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, which cites papers published in so-called “predatory” (or questionable) journals. The analysis revealed that the vast majority of such citances are neutral (97.3%), and negative citations of articles published in the analyzed journals are almost completely nonexistent (0.8%). Moreover, the analysis revealed that the most frequently mentioned countries in the citances are India, Pakistan, and Iran, with mentions of Western countries being rare. This highlights a geopolitical bias and shows the usefulness of looking at such journals as mislocated centers of scholarly communication. The analyzed journals provide regional data prevalent for mainstream scholarly discussions, and the idea of predatory publishing hides geopolitical inequalities in global scholarly publishing. Our findings also contribute to the further development of content-based citation analysis.

AB  - Despite millions of dollars being spent on research each year in Canada, little attention is paid to the dissemination of the results of research. There is a disconnect between Canadian public policies in this area; although a high priority is assigned to the generation of research, there is a lack of policies addressing its dissemination. Meanwhile, the environment in which research knowledge is being disseminated is undergoing a profound transformation because of several important drivers. In particular, these drivers include new technology, changing research patterns, new users, economics, and commercialization. The major objective of this study was to examine the rapidly transforming environment in which research knowledge is disseminated and determine whether there is a need for a national research strategy to adapt to the new, dynamic scholarly communication environment in Canada. To address the latter question, the study adopted a consensus panel process. A consensus panel of 10 Canadian academic researchers from across Canada from a variety of disciplines and at different stages of their careers was recruited from over 70 volunteers. The objective of the panel was to reach a consensus on priorities for research into scholarly communication in Canada. The consensus panel identified five major themes in which there is a need for research in scholarly communication in Canada: Knowledge systems; knowledge/data storage and retrieval; power and infrastructure within the academy; knowledge production and the social contract; copyright and intellectual property. These themes are expanded upon in more detail in the full paper and specific research topics discussed. The results of this study also clearly support the creation of a more holistic and integrated knowledge ecosystem for scholarly communication. In its report, the consensus panel strongly recommended that, ‘a coherent national policy of knowledge preservation and dissemination must be devised to create a greater cohesion, accessibility, security and access to research findings’.

AB  - <h2>Abstract</h2> Recently most of the journals charge a fee known as article processing charge (APC) for publication of an article. These charges can vary from journal to journal. This publication fee is often paid by the author, the author's institution, or their research funder organization. Though low- and middle-income countries are usually exempted from APC, India does not come under the category of waiver by most of the journals that ask for the APC. Most of the Indian institutes do not pay for publication and research thus individual researcher suffers huge financial burden due to APC. Hence, less affluent institutions, scholars, and students are unable to publish their work due to these barriers. These articles highlight the challenges faced by authors and solutions for publishers and journals to avoid APCs.

AB  - Concerns related to stressed library budgets and equitable access to publicly funded research have fomented a movement towards open access (OA) scholarly publishing, in which academic journal articles are made available online free of charge. OA challenges the traditional subscription-based revenue model of major publishing companies; to supplant lost revenue, many have introduced a new Article Processing Charge (APC) based model, in which the authors of a study pay to ensure their article is available on an OA basis. In the past several years, APCs have risen considerably, shifting the publishing cost burden from university libraries to individual research groups, who often pay APCs out of research funds. Focusing primarily on scientific publishing in North America and Europe, we review the circumstances that brought about the APC model, and argue that rising APCs may present a real threat to research productivity. We conclude by presenting some concrete actions that stakeholders in the academic research enterprise could take to uphold the OA standard and mollify the impact of rising APCs.

AB  - Nonprofit scientific societies hope that their activities advance their particular mission and impact their profession and, in the broadest sense, humanity in positive ways. The digital age has provided unprecedented mechanisms to enhance the delivery of science to the world. The marketplace of scientific publishing is a rapidly shifting mosaic of challenges and opportunities, and the responses of nonprofit and commercial publishers vary widely, but their outcomes are still uncertain. The response of the American Society of Mammalogists (ASM) provides an example of how a relatively small society has altered its scientific delivery to enhance member benefits while attempting to sustain its economic viability. Since 2000, ASM has moved from a self-publishing, break-even, print-only model to a copublishing agreement with a commercial publisher (Alliance Communications Group, a division of Allen Press, Inc., Lawrence, Kansas), which now offers members various print and electronic options and generates a shared royalty. Although it is too early to gauge the economic impact of these changes, the ASM leadership clearly attempted to signal its desire for members to view their society as a package of opportunities for edification and involvement rather than just a provider of serial subscriptions. Future challenges facing nonprofit scientific societies include open access, fiscal realities, archiving of publications, and scientific and societal impact; future opportunities include a strengthening of member responsibilities and professionalism, development of data registries to enhance scientific progress, and bundling of like societies. The manner in which nonprofit scientific societies respond to these challenges and opportunities will no doubt affect their sustainability and future impact.

AB  - Abstract Assessing Scholarly OutletsMore recently researchers, scholars, and authors have experienced a proliferation of outlets fordisseminating the results of their scholarly undertakings. Moreover, many of the aforementionedhave received solicitations for disseminating the results of their scholarly undertakings. Thisproliferation is due in great part to the improved time-to-market strategies aided by the Internetto disseminate new knowledge and the entrepreneurial spirit of publishers. Improving time-to-market serves the research community well in that once integrated into the knowledge base thesescholarly outputs serve as a foundation for spawning additional knowledge, faster. However, theentrepreneurial spirit of some publishers threatens the progress in the pursuit of new knowledgeby, as an example, flooding disciplines with findings based on pseudoscience. Researchers,scholars, and authors are receiving solicitations from a brood of questionable industries,commercial endeavors, and partnerships whose goal is to maximize revenue. They help tofacilitate presenting at conferences and publishing in conference proceedings and junk journalsthat publish low quality or pseudoscience science (vs sound science), and they help in theproliferation of vanity publishers (vs mainstream or commercial publishers).An endeavor was initiated by a technology, management, and applied engineering faculty toexamine some of the aforementioned concerns and to develop strategies for addressing thoseconcerns. Among the strategies discussed, pursued, or developed, were the following:As an individual faculty member:• Modify, if appropriate, any contract you sign with a commercial publisher to ensure your right to use your work, including posting on a public archive.• Examine the pricing, copyright, and licensing agreements of any commercially published journal you contribute to as an author, reviewer, or editor.• Consider using your influence by the choices you make about where to publish, and about service as a reviewer or member of an editorial board, and by influencing your colleagues to do the same.• Support your library's efforts to take cost into consideration in making decisions about journal subscriptions.• Investigate your campus intellectual property policies and participate actively in their development.• Support your library's participation in projects that seek to transform scholarly publishing in accord with academic values, such as SPARC, the Scholarly Publishing & Academic Resources Coalition.As a member of the campus community:• Encourage discussion of scholarly communication issues and proposals for change in your department and school.• Invite library participation in faculty departmental meetings and graduate seminars to discuss these issues.• Include electronic publications that meet standards of quality in promotion and tenure discussions.• Critically assess journals and publishers for quality using established criteria.As a member of professional societies:• Encourage your professional society to consider creating alternatives to expensive commercial titles.• Support actively your society's electronic publishing program by submitting papers, reviewing, and serving on editorial boards.• Encourage your society to explore alternatives to contracting or selling publications to a commercial publisher.• Encourage your society to maintain reasonable prices, and faculty and user friendly access terms.

AB  - This paper reports on a survey of 198 early career researchers from Spain, which aimed to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards predatory journals. The results revealed that the primary characteristic of predatory journals is their fast acceptance and publication times, while many other features are similar to legitimate journals. The study recommends several actions, including raising awareness and providing mentorship, promoting ethical publishing practices, and allocating resources to early career researchers by academic institutions. The findings highlight the need for better education and support for researchers in identifying and avoiding predatory journals. The study's conclusions have implications for policymakers, academic institutions, and individual researchers seeking to maintain the integrity of scholarly publishing.

Learn more.Copy URL Share a linkShare onFacebookTwitterLinkedInRedditWechat Can we no longer trust what is published? Last month I was caught up in a 'sting' to identify predatory journals. I had reviewed an article for a journal and after submitting my review (with recommendation of Reject) I came across the same article in a leading journal/magazine. As the article sent to me had been blinded, I assumed that the authors had plagiarized the article. However, it had been submitted by the same author group and the journal editors (who had also identified the duplication) started pursuing the matter with the authors. A few weeks later the lead author contacted the journal to say he was withdrawing it and he revealed that it had been part of an ethics committee approved research project in which the same article had been sent to 600 journals to see if they would spot that it was already published. Like many other people, I have read the several stings that test dodgy journals (e.g. Bohannon, 2013) with interest and been shocked to discover how apparently bad their quality control systems are. However, being the recipient gave me a somewhat different perspective. I had spent a few precious hours reviewing an article for no purpose and I have to admit that I was annoyed about the waste of time – as were the journal editors. The journal it had been submitted to cannot afford the time or money to check every submission via a reliable duplication-checking tool, and I suspect many of the other journals participating in the research were in a similar situation. On the one hand, it will be interesting to discover how many journals accepted the article without discovering its duplication, and on the other hand, it is concerning that so many precious reviewer-hours have been lost to reviewing this article. At Learned Publishing, we do not routinely check every article for plagiarism but rely on the integrity of the authors – only checking where we have a suspicion (style changes or other hints). Our decision is informed by experience, and in the past few years we have only once found a true case of plagiarism – all other apparent duplications were legitimate. The premise behind the research project above, however, is that authors cannot be trusted and all editors should be checking everything. The questions over scholarly trust and integrity continue to make headline news. Concerns about 'fake news' in scholarly publishing either from fraudulent authors or poor quality journals have reached the mainstream press outlets. There is understandable concern about the trustworthiness of scholarly information. An article in the Indian Express ('pay, publish, profit' Yadav, 2018) outlines an emerging industry in low quality journals, which have arisen to provide an outlet for the booming number of researchers and the increasing pressure to publish. Several German journalists initiated their own sting by submitting an article on the use of propolis to control cancer. The rubbish article was both accepted and published, although it has now been retracted. (The article can be found at the following URL: https://www.omicsonline.org/peer-reviewed/combined-effects-of-ethylacetate-extracts-of-propolis-inducing-cell-death-of-human-colorectal-adenocarcinoma-cells-102225.html.) (I am not citing it as I do not want to 'reward' the journal with citation.) Whilst the sting proved a point about lack of quality controls, it should be remembered that the article remains available and citable in support of other hypotheses and research. Whilst the sting may have proved a point, the journalists are now responsible for yet more untrustworthy research being published. It is of particular note that so many articles in this issue of Learned Publishing cover the subject of trust and reliability from different perspectives. Several articles describe the research publishing environment operating in other regions and provide windows to very different experiences. Mahmood Maniati and Alireza Jalilifar (2018) describe the attitudes and strategies of Iranian authors to achieve publication. Iranian authors are usually required to write in English and often suffer from limited research environments but where expectations of publication are high if they wish to keep their jobs. As the authors reveal, Iranian researchers not only have to rely on enlightened editors who are willing to go the extra mile but often feel obliged to adopt unethical strategies in order to achieve publication in the journals of their choice. The strategies do not – according to the authors – undermine the value of the science that the articles report, but they would fail the 'ethical imperative' that is placed on authorship. From the other side of the fence, Radovan Vrana (2018) discusses the challenges that face editors based in small research communities. His analysis of the problems experienced by Croatian editors demonstrates similar problems as faced by all editors, but exacerbated by their environment. He reports difficulties in obtaining reviewers, poor quality reviewer reports, and author misconduct. Comparing this article with the one from Iran clearly demonstrates the tension between the authors' need to publish and the journal editors' wish to maintain standards and selectivity. It is an invidious problem in any journal, but enhanced in resource-poor environments. Vrana describes the huge difficulty in obtaining good reviewers when journals are seen to be 'peripheral' and lack branding. Without good quality review it is hard (perhaps impossible) to only publish high quality research, and so the journals languish in a mid-quality limbo. Promising support to such journals as Vrana describes, as well as those that may be less reliable (or even fraudulent) is a booming industry of accreditation. The article by Xia and Smith (2018) investigates such services. Journals compete to attract authors as well as improve the likelihood of reviewers accepting invitations to review. To help in this competition, they often look for external validation. The gold standard is indexing within Scopus or Medline, or the achievement of an Impact Factor, but only a small number of journals actually achieve this. The recent problems with the Indian University Grants Commission list of recognized journals show how difficult this process of identifying quality journals can be (Patwardhan et al., 2018). The article from Xia and Smith reports on their investigation into companies who have created different metrics for accrediting journals. They reveal a potentially misleading and even fraudulent accreditation system, but one that is being applied as a proxy for trust (in the same way that the Impact Factor is used). Whether the participating journals are aware or not is unclear; however, the application of these validation tools is certainly misleading to researchers (my own discussions with researchers in Egypt and other countries). A fourth aspect of judging the quality control and relevance of journals is addressed by Camillo Lamanna and Stevan Bruijns (2018). Lamanna and Bruijns question what metrics are really useful for determining journal and article relevance – especially in developing regions. They question the accepted proxy of citations as a meaningful quality measure for all users and propose different methods for developing regions such as the sub-Saharan African countries. They suggest that citations are only valid measures within close networks and question their use for those outside these networks. And finally, the paper by Scott, Gibson, and Benner (2018) reveals how drug advertising in journals is frequently misleading because it lacks suitable supporting references – and frequently cites as evidence works authored by company staff. Their conclusion is that such advertising fails the ethical quality criteria that the journals' editorial systems require. Whilst their investigation does not question the quality of research articles in the journals they evaluated, they do reveal shockingly low standards in the advertising which the selected medical journals carry. This has trust implications for the journal as a whole, since it is reasonable for readers to assume the same integrity levels are applied throughout the journal. The questions of trust and quality are also central to our first review articles. This new article type will review interesting industry white papers and other reports and ensure they are archived for future reference. The first two of these articles by Rachel Kessler (2018) and Tom Hill (2018) review papers on data sharing and blockchain in research, respectively. These two areas are under regular discussion as methods for increasing transparency, reproducibility, and validation of scholarship. Returning to the 'sting' research that led to this editorial. We work on a system of trust in publishing, which (if you believe the frequent publications on the topic) appears to be eroding daily. However the focus of discussions on 'predatory' journals may be a selective bias that ignores other problems of equal concern. Can – and should – we trust authors? Should we no longer trust what is published in journals? Can we believe any of the accreditation systems? Are even the trusted journals allowing unreliable content to be published? And how much should we be concerned about this? I suggest that perhaps the ease of establishing online open journals funded by authors under pressure to publish may be backfiring. There is a rapidly growing research population who need a commensurate growth of journals to accommodate their outputs. Equally, this growing research population needs a reliable system that both educates and rewards them on the quality of their work, rather than demanding output. Unless a means of accrediting published research is identified that encompasses all researchers and all journals – not just the small percentage lucky enough to be included in the key indexes – we will perpetuate the existing landscape that divides elite researchers/readers from the underprivileged. Those that can afford it will pay the high APCs to publish in high quality journals, and those that cannot will turn to other (potentially untrustworthy) journals. Equally, where publishing is dominated by commercial interests this is always going to influence how and what is published. These commercial influences are rarely considered by those looking for scholarly content, but because they could affect what is published they have direct effect on trustworthiness. The leading role for academic institutions cannot be underestimated if we are to avoid disenfranchising large swathes of the research community. Unfortunately, however, the mismatch between the global publishing environment and a fragmented evaluation system will make a solution which is in the public interest hard to find.

AB  - Article processing charges ( APC s) are a central mechanism for funding open access (OA) scholarly publishing. We studied the APCs charged and article volumes of journals that were listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals as charging APCs. These included 1,370 journals that published 100,697 articles in 2010. The average APC was $906 U.S. dollars (USD) calculated over journals and $904 USD calculated over articles. The price range varied between $8 and $3,900 USD, with the lowest prices charged by journals published in developing countries and the highest by journals with high‐impact factors from major international publishers. Journals in biomedicine represent 59% of the sample and 58% of the total article volume. They also had the highest APCs of any discipline. Professionally published journals, both for profit and nonprofit, had substantially higher APCs than journals published by societies, universities, or scholars/researchers. These price estimates are lower than some previous studies of OA publishing and much lower than is generally charged by subscription publishers making individual articles OA in what are termed hybrid journals.

AB  - A survey of 998 scholarly journals that use Open Journal Systems (OJS), an open source journal software platform, captures the characteristics of an emerging class of scholar-publisher open access journals. The journals in the sample follow traditional norms for peer-reviewing, acceptance rates, and disciplinary focus, but as a group are distinguished by the number that offer open access to their content, growth rates in new titles, participation rates from developing countries, and extremely low operating budgets. The survey also documents the limited degree to which open source software can alter a field of communication, for OJS appears to have created a third path, dedicated to maximizing access to research and scholarship, as an alternative to traditional scholarly society and commercial publishing routes.

AB  - Recently, a large public academic institution in the US ended its subscription to the most influential publisher of academic research. This institution was driven by the principle that scientific knowledge should not be locked up behind paywalls as the costs of publishing have grown over the years. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prospects of publishing and accessing scientific knowledge from Open Access Journals (OA) and to get a general understanding of what aspects to decide on when a research scholar intends to publish in a Scopus indexed Open Access journal. OA journals are freely available with no cost on the internet. They provide unrestricted access to scientific literature to spread recent updates in various disciplines of science and technology. Method: In this study, the researcher has conducted a non-random survey in alphabetical order, 30 Open Access Scopus indexed Psychology journals for the purpose of understanding and comparing their policies and article processing charges. Result: Based on the survey, research scholars can make decisions based on which journals would be viable for publishing their articles looking at these policies. While some of the journals do not have article processing fees some of the journals charge article processing fees.

AB  - This paper aims for a better understanding of the perspectives of contributors to Spanish academic journals regarding open access, open peer review, and altmetrics. Specifically, it explores how age, gender, years of professional experience, and perception and use of social media influence authors’ opinions of these developments in scholarly publishing. A sample of 295 contributors to Spanish academic journals participated in a survey about the aforementioned topics. They were found to hold a favourable opinion of open access but were more cautious about open peer review and altmetrics. The responses of younger and female scholars indicated more reluctance to accept open peer review practices. A positive attitude toward social networks did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for emerging trends in scholarly publishing. Despite this, ResearchGate users were more aware of altmetrics.

AB  - Abstract This paper studies a selection of 11 Norwegian journals in the humanities and social sciences and their conversion from subscription to open access, a move heavily incentivized by governmental mandates and open access policies. By investigating the journals’ visiting logs in the period 2014–2019, the study finds that a conversion to open access induces higher visiting numbers; all journals in the study had a significant increase, which can be attributed to the conversion. Converting a journal had no spillover in terms of increased visits to previously published articles still behind the paywall in the same journals. Visits from previously subscribing Norwegian higher education institutions did not account for the increase in visits, indicating that the increase must be accounted for by visitors from other sectors. The results could be relevant for policymakers concerning the effects of strict policies targeting economically vulnerable national journals, and could further inform journal owners and editors on the effects of converting to open access.

AB  - Using a database of recent articles published in the field of Global Health research, we examine institutional sources of stratification in publishing access outcomes. Traditionally, the focus on inequality in scientific publishing has focused on prestige hierarchies in established print journals. This project examines stratification in contemporary publishing with a particular focus on subscription vs. various Open Access (OA) publishing options. Findings show that authors working at lower-ranked universities are more likely to publish in closed/paywalled outlets, and less likely to choose outlets that involve some sort of Article Processing Charge (APCs; gold or hybrid OA). We also analyze institutional differences and stratification in the APC costs paid in various journals. Authors affiliated with higher-ranked institutions, as well as hospitals and non-profit organizations pay relatively higher APCs for gold and hybrid OA publications. Results suggest that authors affiliated with high-ranked universities and well-funded institutions tend to have more resources to choose pay options with publishing. Our research suggests new professional hierarchies developing in contemporary publishing, where various OA publishing options are becoming increasingly prominent. Just as there is stratification in institutional representation between different types of publishing access, there is also inequality within access types.

AB  - ABSTRACT One of the most important issues facing scholarly communication today is what constitutes quality in the publishing and dissemination of research findings; the aim of this exploratory research study was to investigate author‐perceived quality characteristics of science, technology and medicine journals. We triangulated data from a small number of volunteer full‐time faculty members of Long Island University, using three different research techniques: (1) questionnaire survey, (2) focus groups, and (3) semi‐structured face‐to‐face interviews. The study identified some significant differences by discipline, gender, and tenure status. Overall, the three most important attributes were the reputation of the journal, the estimated length of time to article publication, and the readership of the journal. Our findings bring new insight into this area for the scholarly research community as a whole.

AB  - Predatory publishing is now rapidly growing and becoming a global challenge to scientific communities. Predatory publications pose a danger that could undermine the quality, integrity, and reliability of published scientific research works. They harm the career of those authors who published on them. The researchers should be aware of the quality of journals while publishing their research results. In this review, we briefly summarize the ways to spot out predatory publications, their harmful effects, and strategies to stop them. Authors should know the lists of predatory journals/publishers which are available on Beall’s list on the internet. Predatory journals take advantage of authors by asking them to publish for a fee without providing peer-review or editing services. The young and inexperienced authors are easy victims of predatory publications. The predatory publications are worthless, just a waste of time, resources, money, and efforts. The objective of this review paper was to create awareness about predatory journals among researchers and scholars.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess the factors that influence authors' decision when choosing a journal for publication and to assess authors' attitudes and practices regarding emerging journals. Methods:cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted between April and July 2017 at Dubai Medical College, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on a convenience sample of 2,764 healthcare professionals. Results: A total of 250 responses were received (response rate: 9%) and 152 valid respondents were included in this study (5.6%), of which the majority were male (61.2%) and aged 41–60 years (68%) from the Middle East and Africa. Most respondents (88.8%) had medical and/or dental qualifications and the majority were in senior clinical (55%) and academic (71.5%) positions. More than half of the respondents (62.5%) had published at least one article in the previous five years. Results showed that journal impact factor (JIF), indexation status, free submission and being international were important among respondents. Based on the respondents that shared their encounters with emerging journals (n = 114), 62 respondents (54.4%) regularly read certain emerging journals, 51 (44.7%) had been a peer-reviewer, 48 (42.1%) had cited content from an emerging journal at least once and 45 (39.5%) had published in emerging journals. Only 18 respondents (14.2%) were not convinced with the need for emerging journals and believed that all researchers should compete for publication in the same international journals. Conclusion: Selection of target journals is driven mainly by JIF, indexation status, free submission and a journal’s international status. A diverse range of opinions and attitudes regarding emerging journals were observed in this study. Keywords: Journal Impact Factor; Open Access Publishing; Editorial Policy; Peer Review; Indexing; Publications; Attitude; United Arab Emirates.

TI  - Avoiding predatory journals and publishers: a cross-sectional study
VL  - 47

AB  - Background: Predatory journals (PJs) are journals that receive and publish articles through unethical publishing practices. Due to the boom of PJs, researchers face a wide range of journals from which to choose. Non-peer reviewed and low-quality articles can ruin the trustworthiness of science and have a damaging impact on decision-makers. Objective: &amp;nbsp;To assess the level of awareness among Ethiopian researchers of PJs and to improve the awareness level through training. Method: &amp;nbsp;The participants were professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and lecturers from different disciplines. The study included 18 statements for participants to indicate their level of awareness on the Likert scale, questions on knowledge resources on PJs, and open-ended questions about ways of avoiding PJs. A one-day programme trained the participants in detecting and avoiding PJs. Results: &amp;nbsp;43 participants completed the pre-assessment online survey and 37 participants completed the post-assessment survey. Many researchers were unaware of PJs and found it somewhat difficult to differentiate PJs from legitimate journals. However, during the post-assessment, the awareness level improved and the participants&amp;rsquo; rating of the task of differentiating PJs from legitimate journals changed from &amp;lsquo;Somewhat difficult&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;Easy&amp;rsquo;. Conclusion: &amp;nbsp;Many researchers were unaware of the potential distinctions between PJs and legitimate journals that are crucial to an appropriate journal for publishing. Especially low awareness was found on the journal impact factor, journal indexing services, and reputable publishers. Hence, before manuscript submission, authors ought to know and practise evaluating journals on the basis of the recommended criteria.

AB  - Academics and scholars need to publish their research results. In addition, they are required to publish scientific papers to prove their research commitment and to achieve certain academic titles in higher education institutions. Globally, there are many scientific journals of well-known publishing houses/universities, which offer opportunities to publish scientific work. One of the recent topics in academic circles is the increasing number of invitations to publish articles via quick procedures, without going through the adequate review process. This phenomenon is threatening academic integrity, as these publishers/journals aim at financial benefits and not contributing to scientific development and progress. There is a gap in the knowledge of the scientific researchers regarding the journal selection to publish their work. Some of them are still unintentionally publishing in such journals, mainly as a lack of information about them. The main purpose of this study is awareness-raising, warning, and guidance of scientific researchers, particularly young researchers by providing information on how to avoid submitting manuscripts in these journals. To achieve this, we have consulted the recent literature and practices of different countries, summarized the most used tools/methods to identify predatory publishers and journals, and lastly, we have developed a guiding algorithm for evaluating them.

AB  - Objectives: There is a recent proliferation of predatory journals (PJ) targeting unwary authors and unsuspecting institutions. We evaluated the awareness, attitude, and practices related to predatory publishing among physicians from the Middle East and Africa. Subjects and Methods: An online survey of a convenience sample of physicians was conducted. One hundred and forty responses were received. Of these 76 were complete and they formed the basis of this study. Results: Respondents hold a specialty board or equivalent (46.1%), doctorate (26.3%) or Master (13.2%). Half of the respondents published between 1 and 10 articles and less than a fifth had no prior authorship experience. Respondents are reportedly fully aware (30.3%) or fairly familiar but were not confident with details (43.4%), whereas 26.3% have no clear idea about models of publishing (open access [OA] vs. subscription-only). Nearly one third have never heard about predatory publishing and one in six of the respondents may have heard about it, but they were not sure. 69.7% reported no knowledge of Jeffery Beall and his list. The majority thought it might be somewhat difficult (51.4%) or difficult (24.3%) to distinguish between predatory and legitimate OA journals and 40%–60% affirmed knowledge of features of predatory publishing practices. 50%–60% recognized that PJ target authors in the developing nations. Respondents reported a variable frequency of unsolicited E-mails inviting them to submit articles to suspected PJ or act as reviewers or editors. Only a minority would take further action to protest against such invitations. Many respondents suggested warning young researchers and inexperienced authors about PJ by improved supervision and mentorship practices. Conclusions: There is a low awareness of predatory publishing. There were varying attitudes and practices among respondents.

AB  - Abstract Background Along with emerging open access journals (OAJ) predatory journals increasingly appear. As they harm accurate and good scientific research, we aimed to examine the awareness of predatory journals and open access publishing among orthopaedic and trauma surgeons. Methods In an online survey between August and December 2019 the knowledge on predatory journals and OAJ was tested with a hyperlink made available to the participants via the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) email distributor. Results Three hundred fifty orthopaedic and trauma surgeons participated, of which 291 complete responses (231 males (79.4%), 54 females (18.6%) and 5 N/A (2.0%)) were obtained. 39.9% were aware of predatory journals. However, 21.0% knew about the “Directory of Open Access Journals” (DOAJ) as a register for non-predatory open access journals. The level of profession (e.g. clinic director, consultant) ( p = 0.018) influenced the awareness of predatory journals. Interestingly, participants aware of predatory journals had more often been listed as corresponding authors ( p &lt; 0.001) and were well published as first or last author ( p &lt; 0.001). Awareness of OAJ was masked when journal selection options did not to provide any information on the editorial board, the peer review process or the publication costs. Conclusion The impending hazard of predatory journals is unknown to many orthopaedic and trauma surgeons. Early stage clinical researchers must be trained to differentiate between predatory and scientifically accurate journals.

AB  - Authors face many choices when selecting a journal for publication. Prospective authors, especially trainees, may be unaware of “predatory” online journals or how to differentiate them from legitimate journals. In this study we assessed awareness of open-access and predatory journals among prospective authors attending scientific writing workshops; our long-term goal was to inform educational goals for the workshops. We surveyed participants of writing workshops at veterinary and medical schools and an international conference over a 1-year period. The survey included 14 statements for respondents to indicate agreement level on a Likert-like scale and four questions on awareness of resources about predatory journals; respondents also defined “predatory journal”. A total of 145 participants completed the survey: 106 (73.1%) from veterinary schools and 86 (59.3%) graduate students or residents. Fewer faculty (vs trainees) agreed that open access was an important factor in deciding where to publish; faculty and postdoctoral researchers were more likely to expect to pay more to publish in an open-access journal. Most respondents (120/145, 82.7%) agreed/strongly agreed that the decision to accept a manuscript should not be influenced by publication charges, but 50% (56/112) indicated they “didn’t know” how publishing costs were supported. Of the 142 respondents who answered, 33 (23.0%) indicated awareness of the term “predatory journal”; 34 (23.9%) were aware of the Directory of Open Access Journals; 24 (16.9%) were aware of the Science “sting” article about predatory journals; and 7 (4.8%) were aware of Beall’s list. Most (93/144, 64.5%) definitions of predatory journals described poor but not predatory journal practices, and some respondents misunderstood the term completely. Mentors should help novice authors to be aware of predatory journals and to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate open-access journals, thus selecting the best journal for their work.

AB  - 'Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to understanding our potential.' Margaret J Wheatley. The focus of any academic or research author is to share his or her findings, and to gain respect and reward for publishing. The ideal journal is one that not only publishes an article quickly but also helps the author to improve the article before publication through peer review, selects only the best research so that the author's article lies alongside other high quality articles, and provides maximum (and long-term) visibility and access to the article. Unfortunately, in the real world, authors need to make tradeoffs between high quality journals, those that work quickly, those that are willing to accept the article and those that provide the best access. Into this mix has come the potential of open access as a means of increasing visibility: journals publish the article without a subscription barrier so anyone, anywhere, can read the article. However, the growth of open access (pushed by institutions, grant bodies and governments as a means of improving human health and knowledge) has come with some unforeseen consequences. In this article, Jeffrey Beall discusses one recent phenomenon that has arisen from the open access movement: that of 'predatory publishers'. These are individuals or companies that use the open access financial system (author pays, rather than library subscribes) to defraud authors and readers by promising reputable publishing platforms but delivering nothing of the sort. They frequently have imaginary editorial boards, do not operate any peer review or quality control, are unclear about payment requirements and opaque about ownership or location, include plagiarised content and publish whatever somebody will pay them to publish. Predatory publishers generally make false promises to authors and behave unethically. They also undermine the scholarly information and publishing environment with a deluge of poor quality, unchecked and invalidated articles often published on temporary sites, thus losing the scholarly record. Jeffrey Beall, a librarian in Denver, US, has watched the rise of such fraudulent practice, and manages a blog site that names publishers and journals that he has identified as predatory. While Beall's lists can provide librarians and knowledgeable authors with information on which journals and publishers to be cautious about, several legitimate publishers, library groups and others have joined forces to educate and inform authors in what to look for when selecting journals to publish in (or read). This initiative, called Think. Check. Submit. (http://thinkchecksubmit.org/), was launched in the latter half of 2015 and hopes to raise awareness of disreputable journals while clearly separating them from valid, high quality, open access journals (of which there are many).

AB  - Abstract The aim of this paper is to examine the status of national learned societies in social sciences and humanities (SSH) in Europe. Previous research shows that learned societies serve diverse roles in higher education and suggests that national societies come under pressure given different developments, such as internationalization or open science adoption. We investigate a comprehensive range of aspects within national learned societies: primary goals, activities, internationalization, organization, funding, membership, and recent changes, addressing potential pressures arising from them. Using a cross‐national survey involving 194 learned societies across eight European countries, we study: (a) do the previous findings from individual countries or small selections of national societies hold for a broad range of learned societies in SSH across Europe, and (b) are national learned societies coming under pressure due to internationalization and commercialization processes? Our findings confirm previous results from single countries and single disciplines and expand them as our results show that national learned societies in SSH play an important role in Europe in promoting multilingualism in science, collaborating with many stakeholders, and fostering interdisciplinarity. Contrary to previous research, most SSH societies in our study have not undergone significant changes in the past 5 years, challenging expectations of their declining role.

AB  - In this study we combine the registered output of a whole university in the Netherlands with data retrieved from the Web of Science. The initial research question was: is it possible to show the impact of the university in its' full broadness, taking into account the variety of disciplines covered in the research profile of the university? In order to answer this question, we analyzed the output of the university as registered in the CRIS system METIS, over the years 2004-2009. The registration covers a wide variety of scholarly outputs, and these are all taken into account in the analysis. In the study we conduct analyses on the coverage of the output of the university, both from the perspective of the output itself, towards the Web of Science ("external"), as well as from the Web of Science perspective itself ("internal"). This provides us with the necessary information to be able to draw clear conclusions on the validity of the usage of standard bibliometric methodologies in the research assessment of universities with such a research profile.

AB  - We test 16 bibliometric indicators with respect to their validity at the level of the individual researcher by estimating their power to predict later successful researchers. We compare the indicators of a sample of astrophysics researchers who later co-authored highly cited papers before their first landmark paper with the distributions of these indicators over a random control group of young authors in astronomy and astrophysics. We find that field and citation-window normalisation substantially improves the predicting power of citation indicators. The sum of citation numbers normalised with expected citation numbers is the only indicator which shows differences between later stars and random authors significant on a 1 % level. Indicators of paper output are not very useful to predict later stars. The famous h-index makes no difference at all between later stars and the random control group.

VL  - 1
AU  - Setti, Gianluca
C1  - Advanced Research Center on Electronic Systems, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the main features of several bibliometric indicators which were proposed in the last few decades. Their pros and cons are highlighted and compared with the features of the well-known impact factor (IF) to show how alternative metrics are specifically designed to address the flaws that the IF was shown to have, especially in the last few years. We also report the results of recent studies in the bibliometric literature showing how the scientific impact of journals as evaluated by bibliometrics is a very complicated matter and it is completely unrealistic to try to capture it by any single indicator, such as the IF or any other. As such, we conclude that the adoption of more metrics, with complementary features, to assess journal quality would be very beneficial as it would both offer a more comprehensive and balanced view of each journal in the space of scholarly publications, as well as eliminate the pressure on individuals and their incentive to do metric manipulation which is an unintended result of the current (mis)use of the IF as the gold standard for publication quality.

AU  - Mongeon, Philippe
C1  - Universitè de Montreal
AB  - Despite holding the potential to liberate scholarly information, the digital era has, to the contrary, increased the control of a few for-profit publishers. While most journals in the print era were owned by academic institutions and scientific societies, the majority of scientific papers are currently published by five for-profit publishers, which often exhibit profit margins between 30%-40%. This paper documents the evolution of this consolidation over the last 40 years, discusses the peculiar economics of scholarly publishing, and reflects upon the role of publishers in today’s academe.

AB  - We aimed to develop an in-depth understanding of quality criteria for scholarly journals by analyzing journals and publishers indexed in blacklists of predatory journals and whitelists of legitimate journals and the lists' inclusion criteria. To quantify content overlaps between blacklists and whitelists, we employed the Jaro-Winkler string metric. To identify topics addressed by the lists' inclusion criteria and to derive their concepts, we conducted qualitative coding. We included two blacklists (Beall's and Cabells Scholarly Analytics') and two whitelists (the Directory of Open Access Journals' and Cabells Scholarly Analytics'). The number of journals per list ranged from 1,404 to 12,357, and the number of publishers ranged from 473 to 5,638. Seventy-two journals and 42 publishers were included in both a blacklist and a whitelist. Seven themes were identified in the inclusion criteria: (i) peer review; (ii) editorial services; (iii) policy; (iv) business practices; (v) publishing, archiving, and access; (vi) website; and (vii) indexing and metrics. Business practices accounted for almost half of the blacklists' criteria, whereas whitelists gave more emphasis to criteria related to policy. Criteria could be allocated to four concepts: (i) transparency, (ii) ethics, (iii) professional standards, and (iv) peer review and other services. Whitelists gave most weight to transparency. Blacklists focused on ethics and professional standards. Whitelist criteria were easier to verify than those used in blacklists. Both types gave little emphasis to quality of peer review. Overall, the results show that there is overlap of journals and publishers between blacklists and whitelists. Lists differ in their criteria for quality and the weight given to different dimensions of quality. Aspects that are central but difficult to verify receive little attention.IMPORTANCE Predatory journals are spurious scientific outlets that charge fees for editorial and publishing services that they do not provide. Their lack of quality assurance of published articles increases the risk that unreliable research is published and thus jeopardizes the integrity and credibility of research as a whole. There is increasing awareness of the risks associated with predatory publishing, but efforts to address this situation are hampered by the lack of a clear definition of predatory outlets. Blacklists of predatory journals and whitelists of legitimate journals have been developed but not comprehensively examined. By systematically analyzing these lists, this study provides insights into their utility and delineates the different notions of quality and legitimacy in scholarly publishing used. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relevant concepts and provides a starting point for the development of a robust definition of predatory journals.

AB  - When Breast Cancer Research was launched in 1999, we took the innovative decision to make all research articles open access. Open access means research published in Breast Cancer Research is universally and freely available via the Internet and the authors or copyright owners grant any third party the right to use, reproduce and disseminate the article. The benefits of open access for the research community are enormous but the consequence is that the journal does not receive any subscription income for its research content. To cover the running costs, Breast Cancer Research will be introducing article-processing charges for all research articles from August 2003.

TI  - Business as Usual with Article Processing Charges in the Transition towards OA Publishing: A Case Study Based on Elsevier
IS  - 1
VL  - 8
AU  - Copiello, Sergio
C1  - Department of Architecture, IUAV University of Venice, Dorsoduro 2206, 30123 Venice, Italy
AB  - This paper addresses the topic of the article processing charges (APCs) that are paid when publishing articles using the open access (OA) option. Building on the Elsevier OA price list, company balance sheet figures, and ScienceDirect data, tentative answers to three questions are outlined using a Monte Carlo approach to deal with the uncertainty inherent in the inputs. The first question refers to the level of APCs from the market perspective, under the hypothesis that all the articles published in Elsevier journals exploit the OA model so that the subscription to ScienceDirect becomes worthless. The second question is how much Elsevier should charge for publishing all the articles under the OA model, assuming the profit margin reduces and adheres to the market benchmark. The third issue is how many articles would have to be accepted, in an OA-only publishing landscape, so that the publisher benefits from the same revenue and profit margin as in the recent past. The results point to high APCs, nearly twice the current level, being required to preserve the publisher’s profit margin. Otherwise, by relaxing that constraint, a downward shift of APCs can be expected so they would tend to get close to current values. Accordingly, the article acceptance rate could be likely to grow from 26–27% to about 35–55%.

AB  - Part 3 of a 3-part series on the origins, impacts, and opponents of predatory journals. In 2014, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper successfully placed a “garbled blend of fake cardiology, Latin grammar, and missing graphs” into a oncereputable Canadian medical journal that had been sold to offshore owners. The journal, now possibly based in Turks and Caicos, accepted a payment of $1200 and published what the newspaper described as a deliberately bad, plagiarized study that substituted the word “cardiac” for “HIV.” The episode, if startling, is hardly isolated. Most members of the small academic subspecialty devoted to studying and tracking questionable publication practices agree that the problem is getting worse. If some shady journals are glaringly obvious, others are more carefully camou- flaged and creeping into scholarly indices and curriculum vitae alike. Efforts to curb the growing influence of these “predatory” publications, particularly in Asia, have been complicated by bitter debates between open access advocates and detractors over perceived biases, unsupported opinions, and unreliable data. Until recently, few efforts had matched the scope of Beall's List of Predatory Open-Access Publishers, a controversial but widely cited set of blacklists that flags dubious publishers, journals, and related companies. “The only thing I know to do is what I'm doing, which is helping people become aware of these publishers and journals so that they can avoid them,” says list curator Jeffrey Beall, associate professor and scholarly communications librarian at the University of Colorado in Denver. Other efforts are gaining momentum, however. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), for example, has compiled a whitelist of high-quality and properly peer-reviewed publications. Two years ago, the DOAJ overhauled its application process and required every journal and publisher in its directory to reapply. Lars Bjørnshauge, the directory's managing director, who is based in Copenhagen, Denmark, says the reappraisal came in response to requests for more vetting from funders, universities, and other stakeholders. The application's new questions, Mr. Bjørnshauge says, dig deeply into the quality and transparency of each journal's editorial process. The reviewers also conduct spot checks on listed editorial board members to verify their willing participation, especially if, as he puts it, “we smell a dodgy publication.” Keeping up with the volume of “questionable” publishers and journals has been a challenge (Mr. Bjørnshauge dislikes the term “predatory”). However, the endeavor has been aided by 7 staff members and 50 volunteer associate editors from around the world. Funding has come from academic and open access publishing members in nearly 30 countries, as well as 33 sponsors that include most major scholarly publishers (Wiley, which publishes Cancer Cytopathology, is among them). Once the vetting process is complete, Mr. Bjørnshauge estimates that perhaps 8500 journals will be listed in the DOAJ, with another 8000 to 9000 journals having been either rejected or dropped due to noncompliance. “It's timeconsuming; it's labor-intensive,” says collaborator Heather Joseph, executive director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) in Washington, DC. “But it has to happen in order for the integrity of the open access publishing process and movement, frankly, to not be further tarnished by some of the bad players.” The DOAJ has also helped launch 2 related projects. One, funded by a grant from Canada's International Development Research Centre, is designed to help open-access journals in the Southern hemisphere improve their quality and is recruiting a team of regional ambassadors to be go-to educators. A related initiative called “Think. Check. Submit.” aims to help researchers discriminate between trustworthy and suspect journals via a checklist of quality indicators. Mr. Beall welcomes the competition, although he cautions that it is too early to say whether the latter campaign will succeed. “If somebody can find a better way to help people avoid predatory publishers and what I'm doing in a complementary way, that's great,” he says. Cabell's International, an academic publishing service in Beaumont, Texas, that curates its own journal directory, is using Mr. Beall's list, the DOAJ, and more than 3 dozen other selection criteria as part of a new initiative to reevaluate the journals included in its database. Despite the usefulness of such lists, other observers say, broader efforts may be needed to counter the advance of predatory publications. “I'm not aware of a single conference that has taken place to bring these disparate groups together to try to sort out a path forward,” says David Moher, PhD, senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. The journalologist recently called for community-wide intervention in a recent editorial.1 If different factions can put aside their grievances, Dr. Moher says, a joint conference might help to highlight knowledge gaps, establish common standards, and establish research and intervention priorities. But who should play the leading role in bringing everyone together? Dr. Moher believes publishers enjoy a “very privileged position” within the industry and are the most logical choice to lead the way in organizing conferences and backing new initiatives such as a global fund to help defray author processing charges. Academic institutions, he says, also must play a more active role in protecting their researchers from shady publishing practices. The reason why we have such a vast predatory journal problem is that there is a market opportunity; that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of researchers looking for a place to publish their work. —Jocalyn Clark, PhD Multiple universities in fact have begun sounding the alarm. The United Kingdom's University of Manchester, for example, has reviewed the common practices of questionable publications and warned its faculty not to use such journals. Savitribai Phule Pune University in India has issued its own guidelines and called out predatory journals and publishers by name. The stepped-up efforts also may spur more reappraisals of an academic reward system that critics say has long pressured researchers to publish in the “right” journals, and has created plenty of opportunities for abuse. “The reason why we have such a vast predatory journal problem is that there is a market opportunity; that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of researchers looking for a place to publish their work,” says Jocalyn Clark, PhD, executive editor of The Lancet. Many are looking to do so using the path of least resistance, with few controls established by those mandated to oversee the research enterprise, she says. From that point of view, Dr. Clark says, it is hard to blame authors for publishing in scam journals if they are not being dissuaded or punished for doing so. “These predatory publishers are just seizing an opportunity,” she says. “That sort of indicts our research culture, which is so very, very focused on ‘publish or perish,’ ” she says. However, the geographical variation in predatory practices suggests that certain practices may exert more positive or negative pressure, says Ms. Joseph. “That gives me hope that a large portion of the spike and a big part of the problem can really be dealt with by asking research institutions to take a look internally at the incentive structures that they've got in place,” she says. Ms. Joseph, Mr. Bjørnshauge, and others say it may be equally instructive to dig into the publishing culture of Latin America, a region in which predatory practices have been much less pervasive to date. “Publish or perish is everywhere–it's in Latin America too,” says Renan Moritz Almeida, PhD, professor of biomedical engineering at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, who also studies scientific integrity. The difference, he says, is that when researchers cannot land a study in a top-tier international journal, their second or even third option is normally not a predatory one. Instead, he says, a robust collection of second-tier journals has given local researchers a readily accessible outlet. In fact, Brazil is second only to the United States in the number of journals in the DOAJ (it gave up its top spot after the recent reapplication process). The majority of Latin America's journals are indexed in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), a kind of PubMed for local and regional openaccess publications (mainly in Central and South America) in which English is not a priority. Many of those publications also are collaboratively funded by universities and funding agencies. Mr. Beall has questioned SciELO's quality, but Dr. Almeida says the publishing framework could be an example for other regions. “In my view, it's a successful system,” he says. Although the combined efforts have spurred cautious optimism in some quarters, Dr. Moher says significantly more resources will be required to understand, and undermine, the motives and mechanisms of predatory publishers. “That doesn't mean we're going to get rid of them all,” he says, “but we may be able to make inroads substantively.”

AB  - Predatory journals have been acknowledged as an increasing concern in the scholarly literature over the last decade, but research on the subject has been sparse. Research that has focused on predatory journals in the Canadian context has been even rarer, and limited to work focused on a single university. This study explores publishing trends in predatory journals by authors affiliated with Canadian universities.Articles published by authors at 30 Canadian universities, including all universities in the U15, were pulled from select predatory journals. Key data including author affiliation, article type, discipline, and grant information were extracted from the articles.All universities in the study were found to have publications in predatory journals. The health sciences accounted for 72% of the publications, and the sciences for 20%. Research articles accounted for 50% of the articles. Opinion, editorial, or commentary pieces accounted for 24% and 19% were review articles. Grant funding was indicated in 34% of the articles, with NSERC and CIHR being top funders. The research-intensive U15 universities were found to publish more in predatory journals than their non-U15 compatriots, even when the universities were of similar size.Canadian scholars were found to publish in predatory journals, particularly those scholars from the health sciences and research-intensive U15 universities. Grant funding was common, and often came from high profile funders like NSERC and CIHR. This study suggests that policy and education initiatives may be warranted in Canadian contexts, especially in the health sciences and at research-intensive universities.

AB  - Since their initial development in the early 2000s, institutional repositories (IRs) have proliferated around the globe. Due to low faculty participation, however, content recruitment has often posed a significant challenge for librarians and others promoting their use. Through the last decade, academic social networks (ASNs), such as ResearchGate and Academia.edu, have become popular among scholars as a means to communicate with each other and share their research. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixty scholars at six universities in Canada and South Africa to explore their views and practices pertaining to IRs and ASNs. Interviews were transcribed and coded to elucidate trends and themes in the data. The study found that few participants were active supporters of their local IRs. Lack of awareness, time limitations, and concerns regarding copyright remain some of the main obstacles to increased faculty participation. Conversely, more than half of the interviewees were active users of either ResearchGate or Academia.edu. These users valued ASNs both as a means of sharing their work and as tools facilitating connections with their colleagues internationally. Though IRs need not compete with these networks, proponents of open access repositories should be prepared to explain to faculty why they should consider having their research made accessible in a repository though they may already actively share their work through ResearchGate or Academia.edu. Significantly, both ASNs and IRs were more popular among South African than Canadian researchers. It is hoped that the results of the study will be helpful in informing the understanding and decisions of librarians and others working to develop and promote IRs and green open access more broadly.

AB  - Abstract Purpose We study the proportion of Web of Science (WoS) citation links that are represented in the Crossref Open Citation Index (COCI), with the possible aim of using COCI in research evaluation instead of the WoS, if the level of coverage was sufficient. Design/methodology/approach We calculate the proportion on citation links where both publications have a WoS accession number and a DOI simultaneously, and where the cited publications have had at least one author from our institution, the Czech Technical University in Prague. We attempt to look up each such citation link in COCI. Findings We find that 53.7% of WoS citation links are present in the COCI. The proportion varies largely by discipline. The total figures differ significantly from 40% in the large-scale study by Van Eck, Waltman, Larivière, and Sugimoto (blog 2018, https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2s234 ). Research limitations The sample does not cover all science areas uniformly; it is heavily focused on Engineering and Technology, and only some disciplines of Natural Sciences are present. However, this reflects the real scientific orientation and publication profile of our institution. Practical implications The current level of coverage is not sufficient for the WoS to be replaced by COCI for research evaluation. Originality/value The present study illustrates a COCI vs WoS comparison on the scale of a larger technical university in Central Europe.

AB  - Dissertations can be the single most important scholarly outputs of junior researchers. Whilst sets of journal articles are often evaluated with the help of citation counts from the Web of Science or Scopus, these do not index dissertations and so their impact is hard to assess. In response, this article introduces a new multistage method to extract Google Scholar citation counts for large collections of dissertations from repositories indexed by Google. The method was used to extract Google Scholar citation counts for 77,884 American doctoral dissertations from 2013 to 2017 via ProQuest, with a precision of over 95%. Some ProQuest dissertations that were dual indexed with other repositories could not be retrieved with ProQuest-specific searches but could be found with Google Scholar searches of the other repositories. The Google Scholar citation counts were then compared with Mendeley reader counts, a known source of scholarly-like impact data. A fifth of the dissertations had at least one citation recorded in Google Scholar and slightly fewer had at least one Mendeley reader. Based on numerical comparisons, the Mendeley reader counts seem to be more useful for impact assessment purposes for dissertations that are less than two years old, whilst Google Scholar citations are more useful for older dissertations, especially in social sciences, arts and humanities. Google Scholar citation counts may reflect a more scholarly type of impact than that of Mendeley reader counts because dissertations attract a substantial minority of their citations from other dissertations. In summary, the new method now makes it possible for research funders, institutions and others to systematically evaluate the impact of dissertations, although additional Google Scholar queries for other online repositories are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage.

AB  - Citation indicators are increasingly used in book‐based disciplines to support peer review in the evaluation of authors and to gauge the prestige of publishers. However, because global citation databases seem to offer weak coverage of books outside the W est, it is not clear whether the influence of non‐ W estern books can be assessed with citations. To investigate this, citations were extracted from G oogle B ooks and G oogle S cholar to 1,357 arts, humanities and social sciences ( AHSS ) books published by 5 university presses during 1961–2012 in 1 non‐ W estern nation, M alaysia. A significant minority of the books (23% in G oogle B ooks and 37% in G oogle S cholar, 45% in total) had been cited, with a higher proportion cited if they were older or in E nglish. The combination of G oogle B ooks and G oogle S cholar is therefore recommended, with some provisos, for non‐ W estern countries seeking to differentiate between books with some impact and books with no impact, to identify the highly‐cited works or to develop an indicator of academic publisher prestige.

AB  - Faced with a prolonged economic crisis, Ukrainian research institutes are under pressure as a direct result of limited funding. This has also had a direct negative impact on the functionality of librarians who have seen increasing limitations to acquisitions. Despite economic difficulties, Ukrainian academic librarians are trying to offer their end-users specialized services that involve active librarian mediation in the preparation and dissemination of the results of these users' scientific work. One notable function is to offer aid to users on how to detect pseudo-scientific journals. In this paper, based on a survey of librarians from leading Ukrainian universities, we studied for the first time, the main information resources and tools used by Ukrainian experts to test the validity of scientific journals so that they may be recommended to library users as reliable channels for disseminating research results. These are tools and resources include Scopus, Web of Science, Beall's blacklists, the DOAJ, Think. Check. Submit., and the Norwegian Register. We describe the benefits and limitations that Ukrainian academic librarians may encounter when each of these resources is used. Modern reformation to Ukrainian science has opened up new opportunities for Ukrainian academic librarians. As a result, if they are able to successfully implement such services, they can regain a prominent place in the scientific life of institutions and on the global academic platform.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate the challenges and opportunities of implementing open access policies in African universities.&#x0D; Methodology: This study adopted a desk methodology. A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries.&#x0D; Findings: The implementation of open access policies in African universities faces significant challenges due to limited infrastructure, funding constraints, and inadequate institutional support. However, these challenges also present opportunities for collaboration, capacity building, and leveraging existing networks to enhance access to scholarly research. By overcoming these barriers through strategic partnerships and targeted investments, African universities can foster greater knowledge dissemination, innovation, and socio-economic development across the continent.&#x0D; Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Institutional theory, diffusion of innovation theory&amp; resource dependency theory may be used to anchor future studies on the challenges and opportunities of implementing open access policies in African universities. Implementing open access policies in African universities encourages innovation in knowledge management practices, including the development of institutional repositories, metadata standards, and digital preservation strategies. African universities' implementation of open access policies can influence national and regional policy frameworks related to scholarly communication, research funding, and copyright reform.

AB  - Abstract This study examines trends in open access article processing charges (APCs) from 2011 to 2021, building on a 2011 study by Solomon and Björk. Two methods are employed, a modified replica and a status update of the 2011 journals. Data are drawn from multiple sources and datasets are available as open data. Most journals do not charge APCs; this has not changed. The global average per‐journal APC increased slightly, from 906 to 958 USD, while the per‐article average increased from 904 to 1,626 USD, indicating that authors choose to publish in more expensive journals. Publisher size, type, impact metrics and subject affect charging tendencies, average APC, and pricing trends. Half the journals from the 2011 sample are no longer listed in DOAJ in 2021, due to ceased publication or publisher de‐listing. Conclusions include a caution about the potential of the APC model to increase costs beyond inflation. The university sector may be the most promising approach to economically sustainable no‐fee OA journals. Universities publish many OA journals, nearly half of OA articles, tend not to charge APCs and when APCs are charged, the prices are very low on average.

AB  - Innovations in scholarly publishing have led to new possibilities for academic journals (e.g., open access), and provided scholars with a range of indicators that can be used to evaluate their characteristics and their impact. This study identifies and evaluates the journal characteristics reported in five databases: Ulrich's Periodicals Directory (Ulrichs), Journal Citation Reports (JCR), SCImago Journal & Country Rank (SJR), Google Scholar Metrics (GS), and Cabell's Periodical Directory (Cabells). It describes the 13 indicators (variables) that are available through these databases—scholarly impact, subject category, age, total articles, distribution medium, open access, peer review, acceptance rate, pricing, language, country, status, and issue frequency—and highlights the similarities and differences in the ways these indicators are defined and reported. The study also addresses the ways in which this kind of information can be used to better understand particular journals as well as the scholarly publishing system.

AB  - We examine the characteristics of 663 Open Access (OA) journals in biology, computer science, economics, history, medicine, and psychology, then compare the OA journals with impact factors to comparable subscription journals. There is great variation in the size of OA journals; the largest publishes more than 2,700 articles per year, but half publish 25 or fewer. While just 29 percent of OA journals charge publication fees, those journals represent 50 percent of the articles in our study. OA journals in the fields of biology and medicine are larger than the others, more likely to charge fees, and more likely to have a high citation impact. Overall, the OA journal landscape is greatly influenced by a few key publishers and journals.

AB  - Abstract The goal of research evaluation is to reveal the achievement and progress of research. Research output offers a basis for empirical evaluation. A fair and just research evaluation should take into account the diversity of research output across disciplines and include all major forms of research publications. This article reviews the literature on the nature of research output in social sciences and humanities in terms of the characteristics of research publications, and then discusses the implications for the research evaluation of social sciences and humanities researchers.

AB  - Objectives To describe and compare the characteristics of scholars who reviewed for predatory or legitimate journals in terms of their sociodemographic characteristics and reviewing and publishing behaviour. Design Linkage of random samples of predatory journals and legitimate journals of the Cabells Scholarly Analytics’ journal lists with the Publons database, employing the Jaro-Winkler string metric. Descriptive analysis of sociodemographic characteristics and reviewing and publishing behaviour of scholars for whom reviews were found in the Publons database. Setting Peer review of journal articles. Participants Reviewers who submitted peer review reports to Publons. Measurements Numbers of reviews for predatory journals and legitimate journals per reviewer. Academic age of reviewers, the total number of reviews, number of publications and number of reviews and publications per year. Results Analyses included 183 743 unique reviews submitted to Publons by 19 598 reviewers. Six thousand and seventy-seven reviews were for 1160 predatory journals (3.31% of all reviews) and 177 666 reviews for 6403 legitimate journals (96.69%). Most scholars never submitted reviews for predatory journals (90.0% of all scholars); few scholars (7.6%) reviewed occasionally or rarely (1.9%) for predatory journals. Very few scholars submitted reviews predominantly or exclusively for predatory journals (0.26% and 0.35%, respectively). The latter groups of scholars were of younger academic age and had fewer publications and reviews than the first groups. Regions with the highest shares of predatory reviews were sub-Saharan Africa (21.8% reviews for predatory journals), Middle East and North Africa (13.9%) and South Asia (7.0%), followed by North America (2.1%), Latin America and the Caribbean (2.1%), Europe and Central Asia (1.9%) and East Asia and the Pacific (1.5%). Conclusion To tackle predatory journals, universities, funders and publishers need to consider the entire research workflow and educate reviewers on concepts of quality and legitimacy in scholarly publishing.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study is to chart the scholarly journal landscape in the UAE in order to provide a scientific perspective on research productivity, distribution, and access in the country and lay the foundations for further research in this area. The study aims also to contribute to research endeavoring to paint a global picture of scholarly publishing. We carried out a mapping of scholarly journals published in the UAE compiled from international and local sources. The resulting journal list was studied focusing on the share of OA titles, language of publication, discipline, and type of publisher. Our results show that: (1) 534 journals are published in the UAE and that the share of OA is quite noteworthy with about 64% of all online journals; (2) the APC-based OA model is prevalent with around 75% of OA journals levying a publication fee; (3) UAE journals are predominantly in English while the number of Arabic-language journals is marginal; (4) science, technology and medicine prevail as the most prevalent subject areas of the journals; and (5) commercial publishers control most of the publications especially in the medical field. The study lays a foundation for further studies on scholarly journals in the UAE. The combination of regional indexes and international directories to measure the country’s scholarly journal output can also be replicated and built upon for other countries where the major international bibliometric databases do not provide a comprehensive representation of scholarly publishing activities.

AB  - Based on a detailed analysis of the global academic impact of China’s scientific journals, as well as of the publishing strategies and communication media used by their publishers, we conclude that the Science, Technology, and Medicine (STM) journal publishing industry in China is going through very rapid transformation. Journals are attempting to become more broadly international, and doing so by adopting new digital production methods and commercial models. In light of these efforts, we discuss the current challenges to the development of China’s scientific journal industry and suggest strategies that may be useful for reaching key goals.

AB  - Abstract Over 660 Chinese researchers were questioned about their scholarly use, citing, and publishing and how trust is exercised in these key activities. Research showed few signs of new forms of scholarly usage behaviour taking hold, despite multiple opportunities afforded by Science 2.0 developments. Thus, for determining trustworthiness for usage purposes, the most important activity was reading the abstract. In terms of citations, citing the seminal source was the most common activity. In contrast, citing non‐peer reviewed sources, such as the social media, was not thought acceptable. For publishing, relevance to the field was the most important factor when choosing a place to publish. Comparisons were made with a study of 3650 international researchers, which employed the same methods and questions. The main differences between Chinese and international researchers were that the former (a) rated abstracts more highly, (b) took into account impact factors more when citing and publishing and (c) were much more likely to be influenced by institutional directives when placing their articles.

AB  - Citation analysis as one of the most widely used methods of bibliometrics can be used for computing the various impact measures for scholars based on data from citation databases. Journal Citation Reports (JCR) from Thomson Reuters provides annual report in the form of impact factor (IF) for each journal.We aimed to evaluate the citation parameters of Hepatitis Monthly by JCR in 2010 and compare them with GS and Sc.All articles of Hepat Mon published in 2009 and 2008 which had been cited in 2010 in three databases including WoS, Sc and GS gathered in a spreadsheet. The IFs were manually calculated.Among the 104 total published articles the accuracy rates of GS and Sc in recording the total number of articles was 96% and 87.5%. There was a difference between IFs among the three databases (0.793 in ISI [Institute for Scientific Information], 0.945 in Sc and 0.85 GS). The missing rate of citations in ISI was 4% totally. Original articles were the main cited types, whereas, guidelines and clinical challenges were the least ones.None of the three databases succeed to record all articles published in the journal. Despite high sensitivity of GS comparing to Sc, it cannot be a reliable source for indexing since GS has lack of screening in the data collection and low specificity. Using an average of three IFs is suggested to find the correct IF. Editors should be more aware on the role of original articles in increasing IF and the potential efficacy of review articles in long term impact factor.

AB  - A citation study of the 692 staff that makes up unit of assessment 58 (archaeology), in the 2001 UK Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) was undertaken. Unlike earlier studies, which were obliged to make assumptions on who and what had been submitted for assessment, these were, for the first time available from the RAE Web site. This study, therefore, used the specific submission details of authors and their publications. Using the Spearman rank‐order correlation coefficient, all results showed high statistically significant correlation between the RAE result and citation counts. The results were significant at 0.01 per cent. The findings confirm earlier studies. Given the comparative cost and ease of citation analysis, it is recommended that, correctly applied, it should be the initial tool of assessment for the RAE. Panel members would then exercise their judgement and skill to confirm final rankings.

Here we present standards of good practice for analyzing bibliometric data and presenting and interpreting the results. Comparisons drawn between research groups as to research performance are valid only if (1) the scientific impact of the research groups or their publications are looked at by using box plots, Lorenz curves, and Gini coefficients to represent distribution characteristics of data (in other words, going beyond the usual arithmetic mean value), (2) different reference standards are used to assess the impact of research groups, and the appropriateness of the reference standards undergoes critical examination, and (3) statistical analyses comparing citation counts take into consideration that citations are a function of many influencing factors besides scientific quality.

AB  - An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good.The old tradition is the willingness of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals without payment, for the sake of inquiry and knowledge.The new technology is the internet.The public good they make possible is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all scientists, scholars, teachers, students, and other curious minds".That is the beginning paragraph of the Budapest Open Access Initiative, known as the Budapest Declaration.1 Most likely, no one associated with science, research, or scientific knowledge would be against these statements; 'public good' or 'for the sake of inquiry and knowledge' are altruistic terms that fit perfectly with the research environment.Unfortunately, in some of the subsequent lines, a not-so-encouraging sentence appears: "While the peer-reviewed journal literature should be accessible online without cost to readers, it is not costless to produce".This declaration gave birth to a new type of journal, the open access journals, with a business model based on the statement, "These new journals will not charge subscription or access fees, and will turn to other methods for covering their expenses".

AB  - The Radical Open Access Collective (ROAC) is a community of scholar-led, not-for-profit presses, journals and other open access (OA) projects. The collective promotes a progressive vision for open access based on mutual alliances between the 45+ member presses and projects seeking to offer an alternative to commercial and legacy models of publishing. This article presents a case study of the collective, highlighting how it harnesses the strengths and organizational structures of not-for-profit, independent and scholar-led publishing communities by 1) further facilitating collective efforts through horizontal alliances, and by 2) enabling vertical forms of collaboration with other agencies and organizations within scholarly publishing. It provides a background to the origins of the ROAC, its members, its publishing models on display and its future plans, and highlights the importance of experimenting with and promoting new forms of communality in not-for-profit OA publishing.

TI  - Combatting Exclusionary Language Practices in Science Publishing: A DEI Concern
AU  - Gordon, Sarah

AB  - Over the last few decades, English has become the dominant language of science. It offers a platform for communication across countries and knowledge-building processes.1 The mantra of “publish or perish” in the academic community is well known, and many are under increasing pressure to publish in high-profile journals, which are mostly English-language journals.2,3 Academics are expected to publish in English regardless of whether this is their mother tongue, or even what region their research was conducted in. As a result, non-native English speakers invest considerably more time and effort in honing their academic writing skills in a language that is not their own. While many non-native English speakers can meet or exceed the writing skills of their native English speaking counterparts, the extra effort required to reach that level places them at a significant disadvantage. In this context, your success as an academic appears to be contingent on your ability to write in English. However, navigating the Anglophone scientific publishing world can be stressful and can cause anxiety for many non-native English speakers. Academics that choose an alternative route and publish in non-English language journals are at a disadvantage as their work is often cited less and overlooked in the international community,4 but ignoring non-English literature and scientific advancements in other countries creates biases in research. Furthermore, ignoring research published in other languages also contributes to incomplete scientific understanding and hinders international collaborations on global challenges such as climate change and pandemics.1,4 English-Only Compounds Inequities The crude construction of the […]

AB  - Next to the spoken word, scholarly journals have always been the most immediate and important way for scientists to communicate. Maintaining their quality is therefore crucial to the success and advancement of the scientific enterprise. For centuries, learned societies have taken on the task of reviewing, producing, and monitoring publications for their field. By enabling publishing by scientists for scientists, they have helped the scientific community to self-organize.Examples of such societies include the Royal Society, the National Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Institute of Physics (which publishes Physics Today). Also included are the many university presses—Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and others.The society and university presses are nonprofit. Many have evolved over centuries, and each has a great tradition of reporting scientific advances and discoveries. Because scientists see the value in the scholarly publishing enterprise, they are willing to volunteer their time as journal editors, referees, or authors. Their input is invaluable in offering the scientific community a degree of quality control over publications.In contrast, commercial publishers have discovered that there is money to be made in the growing market for science publications. Commercialization of journals has contributed significantly to an explosion in their price, their numbers, and the quantity of papers they seek to publish. As a consequence, college and university libraries often can no longer afford all the journals.A way that commercial publishers have maintained their profits is to change the publishing concept from a pay-to-read strategy, which places the financial burden mostly on libraries and thus their universities, to a pay-to-publish scheme in which authors pay a fee to get their papers published. The pay-to-publish approach allows commercial publishers to circumvent quality control both for existing journals and for new journals that often have minimal pre-publication review. Thus both the number of publications—and of paying authors—and the publishers’ revenue are dramatically increased. The marketing strategy for pay-to-publish is to call it “open access.” It plays on the idea that the results of research financed by the public should also be freely accessible to the public. CYNTHIA B. CUMMINGSPPT|High resolution For more than 25 years, however, the scientific community has benefited from an effective solution to the problem of open, cheap, and easy access to scientific publications: The preprint server arXiv.org and other open internet archives make freely available to everyone the contents of articles in an increasing number of science and engineering fields.Presently, arXiv.org has operating costs, including salaries for five full-time staff members, that are less than $1 million per year. Expenses are paid by Cornell University with funding from NSF, and the operation is transparent.In physics, mathematics, astronomy, information science, and statistics, the vast majority of papers worldwide are already freely available on servers like arXiv.org. Other fields are catching up quickly.Many journals from scientific societies—the Physical Review family from the American Physical Society, for example—accept submissions of papers already posted on arXiv.org. That process leads either to publication of an improved version of the paper in the journal and on the preprint server or to rejection by the journal. Thus journal publication provides the stamp of quality from the scientific community.The refereeing process and the enhancement of a paper’s quality and readability by and for the scientific community are critical for the community’s advancement. In principle, that added value is also possible with the pay-to-publish concept, but not together with the for-profit goal of commercial publishers.A pay-to-publish system will likely lead to two tiers of publications. In some instances, it already has. At the high end, respected for-profit and nonprofit journals will ask authors for exorbitant publication fees to cover costs of refereeing, selection, and marketing; authors will want to publish in them to promote their careers and to secure funding.At the low end, for-profit journals will publish basically anything, provided the authors pay a publication fee. The net result of the lower tier will be a major problem for the scientific community and a disaster for the public: A flood of publications with minimal quality control will erode the separation between legitimate and junk science and will extract vast additional publishing costs from the scientific community and thus from public coffers.Plan S, proposed by a group of European funding agencies, would enforce the pay-to-publish model. (See “Concerns remain over European open-access proposal,” Physics Today online, 28 June 2019, and “Open access at a crossroads,” Physics Today online, 11 October 2018.)The plan in its present form has several major problems. A glaring example is that it does not allow scientists with funding from Plan S–supporting organizations to publish in the leading scientific journals. In most cases, those journals are published by academic societies. Plan S raises other concerns, too:• The plan ignores the enormous difference between commercial publishers, with their principal aim of making money, and academic societies, with their principal aim of advancing science.• Plan S breaks with the centuries-old tradition of quality control in scientific society publishing. Instead, it enforces a top-down approach that effectively promotes publication of all submitted papers. Having a flood of papers that contain flawed or even wrong research but are freely available clearly is not in the interest of the general public, who through taxes still has to pay twice: once for the research itself and again for the pay-to-publish system.• Plan S implies a redistribution of public research money to commercial publishers and away from support of the research itself. For example, a research group that produces about 20 papers per year would have to pay €100 000 ($114 000) annually for the papers to be freely available in respectable journals. That’s the approximate salary equivalent of at least two PhD positions, depending on the country.• Authors who cannot pay cannot get published.• Plan S will isolate countries that sign onto it from the rest of the international research community. It will lead to a loss of collaborations because researchers from Plan S–supporting countries will not be able to easily publish with colleagues from nonparticipating nations.• The plan will inhibit the influx of international talent into countries that are under Plan S.• Young scientists from countries whose funding agencies have signed onto Plan S will have difficulty finding positions abroad because they have not been able to publish in leading society journals.• Plan S offers insufficient cost and quality controls. In fact, Plan S in its current form undermines both cost and quality controls.A practical alternative to rapidly reduce the costs of scientific publishing is for libraries to take coordinated action and simply unsubscribe from high-cost for-profit journals. The incentive for researchers to publish in such journals would then quickly disappear. The Max Planck Society in Germany and many German universities have taken the lead on that approach; as of 1 January 2019, they ceased subscribing to all Elsevier journals. Such a coordinated action will strengthen the position of academic-society journals and will help them preserve the peer-review system and thus maintain quality control. The overall costs of journals then would fall quickly and dramatically.Good scientific publishing is led by and for the scientific community through its academic societies and university presses. We scientists should be highly skeptical about both commercially driven and ideologically driven movements in scientific publishing. Preprint servers like arXiv.org can make open access easy and inexpensive, and coordinated efforts to avoid for-profit journals can support the tradition of refereed, quality-controlled scientific papers. Ready access and availability have already been achieved in many fields; remaining fields should follow their example. Section:ChooseTop of page <<CITING ARTICLES© 2019 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Academic publishers claim that they add value to scholarly communications by coordinating reviews and contributing and enhancing text during publication. These contributions come at a considerable cost: US academic libraries paid $$\$1.7$$ billion for serial subscriptions in 2008 alone. Library budgets, in contrast, are flat and not able to keep pace with serial price inflation. We have investigated the publishers' value proposition by conducting a comparative study of pre-print papers from two distinct science, technology, and medicine corpora and their final published counterparts. This comparison had two working assumptions: (1) If the publishers' argument is valid, the text of a pre-print paper should vary measurably from its corresponding final published version, and (2) by applying standard similarity measures, we should be able to detect and quantify such differences. Our analysis revealed that the text contents of the scientific papers generally changed very little from their pre-print to final published versions. These findings contribute empirical indicators to discussions of the added value of commercial publishers and therefore should influence libraries' economic decisions regarding access to scholarly publications.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the number of journals de-indexed by Scopus during the last two decades, specifically, from 2000 through 2019. Data for the study were retrieved from SCImago, a Scopus database. The scope of the study is global, covering all the 27 major subject disciplines categorized in Scopus. A total of 6059 research journals were found to be de-indexed from Scopus up until 2019, accounting for 18.61 percent of the total journals indexed in Scopus till date. Among the total de-indexed journals, 2311 (38.14%) journals were de-indexed from the period between 2000 and 2019. A steady decline in the de-indexing of journals has been observed after the year 2010. Among the top 20 countries with the highest number of de-indexed journals, it was found that 90.11 percent of journals have been de-indexed from these countries altogether. The United States stands out as the leading country, contributing to nearly one-third of the total de-indexed journals worldwide, with Medicine (44%) being the leading subject area in the de-indexed journals. On a national level, Sweden takes the lead, recording the highest de-indexing rate of 40.70 percent of journals. Following standard publishing parameters in publishing research results is of utmost importance for several reasons, with the primary one being dissemination of genuine and authentic research for the larger benefit of society. Any compromise with the quality of published research must be addressed seriously, and if necessary de-indexing a journal as a punitive measure should be considered appropriate and welcomed.

AB  - Recent research has tried to calculate the “total cost of publication” in the British academic sector, bringing together the costs of journal subscriptions, the article processing charges (APCs) paid to publish open-access content, and the indirect costs of handling open-access mandates. This study adds an estimate for the other publication charges (predominantly page and colour charges) currently paid by research institutions, a significant element which has been neglected by recent studies. When these charges are included in the calculation, the total cost to institutions as of 2013/14 is around 18.5% over and above the cost of journal subscriptions—11% from APCs, 5.5% from indirect costs, and 2% from other publication charges. For the British academic sector as a whole, this represents a total cost of publication around £213 million against a conservatively estimated journal spend of £180 million, with non-APC publication charges representing around £3.6 million. A case study is presented to show that these costs may be unexpectedly high for individual institutions, depending on disciplinary focus. The feasibility of collecting this data on a widespread basis is discussed, along with the possibility of using it to inform future subscription negotiations with publishers.

AB  - Purpose This paper offers a “content analysis of metadata, titles, and abstracts” (CAMTA) method underpinned by a newly evolved metadata, title, abstract, introduction, methodology, results, analysis, and discussion (M-TAIMRAD) Framework. Design/methodology/approach Draws on innovations of content analysis from the field of health- care to offer a pragmatic and transparent method for conducting rigorous and valid research within the field of business and management. Findings Replicable and valid guidelines for conducting the CAMTA method are offered, including an illustration. This is followed by a critical examination of the potential applications and benefits of the method to the field of business and management research. Originality/value The CAMTA method enables researchers to assimilate and synthesise metadata, titles and abstracts as a means of identifying grounds for future research and theory development. This will help to advance the field and subsequently benefit the wider readership including fellow academics, practitioners and policymakers. The flexibility of the CAMTA method means that it can be used as a stand-alone method or combined as part of a mixed-methods approach.

C1  - The University of Sydney, Sydney 2006, Australia
AB  - Participation in the writing or revising of a manuscript is, according to many journal guidelines, necessary to be listed as an author of the resulting article. This is the traditional concept of authorship. But there are good reasons to shift to a contributorship model, under which it is not necessary to contribute to the writing or revision of a manuscript, and all those who make substantial contributions to a project are credited. Many journals and publishers have already taken steps in this direction, and further adoption will have several benefits. This article makes the case for continuing to move down that path. Use of a contributorship model should improve the ability of universities and funders to identify effective individual researchers and improving their ability to identify the right mix of researchers needed to advance modern science. Other benefits should include facilitating the formation of productive collaborations and the creation of important scientific tools and software. The CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) taxonomy is a machine-readable standard already incorporated into some journal management systems and it allows incremental transition toward contributorship.

IS  - 1
AU  - Friedman, Megan
C1  - Biomed Central#TAB#
AB  - &gt;&gt; See video of presentation (25 min.)BioMed Central is the open access publisher who pioneered this publishing model and has been part of Springer since 2008. We launched our first journal in the year 2000, and have since seen several positive global developments which have helped establish open access as an important trend in the evolvement of scholarly communication. We have consequently observed a steady increase in awareness of open access and specifically, of our wide range of specialist as well as broad interest titles which is reflected in our growing submission numbers.BioMed Central as one of the main open access publishers has helped to establish open access as a new way of making academic research available to researchers and the public, and to introduce a change of the subscription business model in academic publishing and libraries. While BioMed Central also offers a solution for the Green Route of open access (“Open Repository”) the main part of our publishing activity is centred around our fully or “gold” open access journals. BioMed Central and SpringerOpen practise the “author pays” model, whereby the author is asked to pay a fee to cover the publisher’s cost of publishing and distributing the article. While the awareness of open access is growing among the academics, there is still uncertainty among many of how open access works and why they are asked to pay a fee. To cover that fee can still be a major obstacle for a researcher attempting to publish an article in an open access journal, as the SOAP report stated in 2011.I will present an analysis of the most recent open access developments and studies globally; as well as the effect that this has had on a number of factors that play a role in scholarly publishing, such as Impact Factors, citations and awareness of open access among academics. I will give an update on BioMed Central and Springer’s own development in the arena of open access and visibility of research, including experimenting with alternative methods of evaluating research such as Altmetric and the SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank. I will conclude with an overview of how we are working with research organisations and universities to offer financial support to their researchers in order to cover the fee for publishing in BioMed Central and SpringerOpen journals in the context of our institutional membership program.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper reports on a study – overseen by representatives of the publishing, library, and research funder communities in the UK – investigating the drivers, costs, and benefits of potential ways to increase access to scholarly journals. It identifies five different but realistic scenarios for moving towards that end over the next five years, including gold and green open access, moves towards national licensing, publisher‐led delayed open access, and transactional models. It then compares and evaluates the benefits as well as the costs and risks for the UK. The scenarios, and the modelling on which they are based, amount to a benefit‐cost analysis to help in appraising policy options. Our conclusion is that policymakers should encourage the use of existing subject and institutional repositories, but avoid pushing for reductions in embargo periods, which might put at risk the sustainability of the underlying scholarly publishing system. They should also promote and facilitate a transition to gold open access, while seeking to ensure that the average level of publication fees does not exceed c.£2.000; that the rate in the UK of open access publication is broadly in step with the rest of the world; and that total payments to publishers from UK universities do not rise as a consequence.

TI  - Country names in journal titles: shaping researchers’ perception of journals quality
IS  - 2

AB  - Abstract Numerous academic journals incorporate geographic names, including countries and regions, in their titles. This practice is not uniform, as some journals opt to internationalise by omitting these affiliations. To gauge the impact of country names in journal titles on researchers' perceptions of journal quality, 408 researchers in sociology, psychology, environmental sciences, and physical chemistry in Brazil, Canada, Germany, Malaysia, Nigeria, and the USA were surveyed. The study reveals that most researchers believe that a journal's association with a specific country influences their perception of its quality (74.6%) and international readership (76.8%). Consequently, researchers tend to avoid journals with country-specific titles, suspecting limited readership or a predominant focus on papers from that country. However, exceptions exist, primarily in terms of perception, especially for American journals, which are often perceived as indistinguishable from mainstream international journals. Disciplinary variations emerge, with subject matter influencing perceptions. Subjects such as sociology, closely tied to local and national issues, exhibit a more (compared to e.g., chemistry) significant tendency toward recognising national journals. The inclusion of the term "international" in journal titles elicits mixed opinions, with some associating it with low quality or predatory journals, a perception that stems from the proliferation of predatory journals in some Asian and African countries. This study offers insight into researchers’ preferences and underscores the important role of journal titles in shaping researchers' perceptions of journals’ scope, quality and readership. In a challenging metric-driven research and publishing landscape, it is important to strike a balance between internationalisation and fostering diversity in scholarly journal publishing.

AB  - Credit for scientific discovery plays a central role in the reward structure of science. As the "currency of the realm," it powerfully influences the norms and institutional practices of the research ecosystem. Though most scientists enter the field for reasons other than desiring credit, once in the field they desire credit for their work. In addition to being a source of pleasure, credit and recognition are necessary for successful careers. The consensus among sociologists, philosophers, and economists is that pursuit of credit increases the efficiency of the scientific enterprise. Publishing results in a scholarly journal is the core approach to obtaining credit and priority, and the publishing landscape is undergoing dramatic change. As research groups get larger and more interdisciplinary, and scholarly journals proliferate, allocating credit has become more difficult. Awards and prizes further contribute to credit by recognizing prior attributions and articulating new credit attributions through their decisions. Patents can have a complex relationship to credit, and disputes over authorship and credit are common and difficult to adjudicate. Pathologic pursuit of credit adversely affects the scientific enterprise. Academic institutions assess credit in appointment and promotion decisions, and are best positioned to assume responsibility for addressing problems with the credit ecosystem. Several possible remedies are presented.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper explores the scholarly communication ‘industry’ using a product systems approach, scopes and sizes the Australian scholarly communication product system, and examines the economics behind its operation. We find that the set of interrelationships between the market characteristics of information and cost structures, patterns of demand and acquisition practices, and the forces encouraging increasing scholarly output go a long way towards explaining the operation of the system and the genesis of the crisis. Based on our economic analysis of the system, we outline broad market conforming and market distorting approaches to alleviating the crisis.

AB  - Relevance. The 2022 Update of the COPE, DOAJ, OASPA, and WAME joint guidelines on The Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing encourages journals to establish their own policy in “data sharing and reproducibility” (DS&amp;R). However, this document neither provides detailed recommendations / templates nor explains the reproducibility crisis phenomenon. Objectives. To analyze and interpret the international guidelines, the best practices of global publishers and journals, as well as typical mistakes and experience of selected Russian journals, to help a journal develop its own DS&amp;R policy and its implementation. Materials and methods. The analysis of various sources (literature, reporting guidelines, data repositories), policies of 83 Russian university journals, as well as policies of the top 5 international publishers and their journals. Interviews with 6 editors-in-chief of Russian journals regarding DS&amp;R. Results. All the top 5 global publishers in their DS&amp;R policy adapt the TOP Guidelines and offer their own data sharing statement templates. Discussion and interpretations. The author suggests Russian translation of the TOP Guidelines and the main templates (e.g., data sharing statement). He also discusses 9 best journal policies and practices (including pre-registration studies). Conclusions. Numerous international sources, as well as the experience of selected Russian journals, demonstrate that the implementation of the DS&amp;R policy increases articles citation (averagely by 25.3%), the growth of journal’s bibliometric and altmetric indicators, and also contributes to the trust of the target audience. As a result, it strengthes the journal portfolio to enable publishing articles well ahead of schedule. However, only the declarative statement of DS&amp;R policies by journals without proper implementation does not bring tangible benefits to the journals.

AB  - The possibility of open-access scholarly publications started almost 24 years ago, in response to a growing demand to make research findings free and available to anyone with a computer and an Internet connection, and building on the digital developments of the 1990s. The initiators of the movement came from a wide range of prestigious research-intensive institutions and major research funders including Harvard, the Max Planck Institute, University College London, the University of Montreal and - amongst funders - the Open Society Foundations and the Wellcome Trust. They worked on open-access issues for 10 years before releasing the Budapest Declaration and Guidelines for Open Access Publishing in 2001. Sadly, the Mellon, Carnegie and Ford Foundations seem not to have been supporters at that stage.

AB  - Although many observers have advocated the reform of the scholarly publishing system, improvements to functions like peer review have been adopted sluggishly. We argue that this is due to the tight coupling of the journal system: the system's essential functions of archiving, registration, dissemination, and certification are bundled together and siloed into tens of thousands of individual journals. This tight coupling makes it difficult to change any one aspect of the system, choking out innovation. We suggest that the solution is the "decoupled journal." In this system, the functions are unbundled and performed as services, able to compete for patronage and evolve in response to the market. For instance, a scholar might deposit an article in her institutional repository, have it copyedited and typeset by one company, indexed for search by several others, self-marketed over her own social networks, and peer reviewed by one or more stamping agencies that connect her paper to external reviewers. The decoupled journal brings publishing out of its current 17th-century paradigm, and creates a Web-like environment of loosely joined pieces—a marketplace of tools that, like the Web, evolves quickly in response to new technologies and users' needs. Importantly, this system is able to evolve from the current one, requiring only the continued development of bolt-on services external to the journal, particularly for peer review.

AB  - The first ever quantitative paper to claim that papers published in so-called “predatory” open access (OA) journals and publishers were financially remunerated emerged from Canada. That study, published in the Journal of Scholarly Publishing (University of Toronto Press) in 2017 by Derek Pyne at Thompson Rivers University, garnered wide public and media attention, even by renowned news outlets such as The New York Times and The Economist. Pyne claimed to have found that most of the human subjects of his study had published in “predatory” OA journals, or in OA journals published by “predatory” OA publishers, as classified by Jeffrey Beall. In this paper, we compare the so-called “predatory” publications referred to in Pyne’s study with Walt Crawford’s gray open access (grayOA) list, as well as with Cabell’s blacklist, which was introduced in 2017. Using Cabell’s blacklist and Crawford’s grayOA list, we found that approximately 2% of the total publications (451) of the research faculty at the small business school were published in potentially questionable journals, contrary to the Pyne study, which found significantly more publications (15.3%). In addition, this research casts doubt to the claim made in Pyne’s study that research faculty members who have predatory publications have 4.3 “predatory” publications on average.

AB  - Dimensions is a new database that focussed on a different set of problems to other scholarly search systems. Specifically, by the including not only data about publications and their natural associated citation graph, but by also including awarded grant data, patent data and clinical data and altmetric attention data, Dimensions holds a representation of an n-partite graph associated with the heterogeneous research objects. These objects have been treated as heterogeneous, but need to be brought onto the same footing (and homogenised) in order that they should make sense to a user. The links (or edges) in the expanded network of objects is created through extensive use of text mining and machine learning to extract and to normalise data. This article gives an overview of the techniques used to create the Dimensions dataset.

AB  - This study investigates online material published in reaction to a Science Magazine report showing the absence of peer‐review and editorial processes in a set of fee‐charging open access journals in biology. Quantitative and qualitative textual analyses are combined to map conceptual relations in these reactions, and to explore how understandings of scholarly communication and publishing relate to specific conceptualizations of science and of the hedging of scientific knowledge. A discussion of the connection of trust and scientific knowledge and of the role of peer review for establishing and communicating this connection provides for the theoretical and topical framing. Special attention is paid to the pervasiveness of digital technologies in formal scholarly communication processes. Three dimensions of trust are traced in the material analyzed: (a) trust through personal experience and informal knowledge, (b) trust through organized, internal control, (c) trust through form. The article concludes by discussing how certain understandings of the conditions for trust in science are challenged by perceptions of possibilities for deceit in digital environments.

AU  - Severin, Anna
AU  - Egger, Matthias
AU  - Eve, Martin
AU  - Hürlimann, Daniel
AB  - Background: Many of the discussions surrounding Open Access (OA) revolve around how it affects publishing practices across different academic disciplines. It was a long-held view that it would be only a matter of time before all disciplines fully and relatively homogeneously implemented OA. Recent large-scale bibliometric studies show, however, that the uptake of OA differs substantially across disciplines. We aimed to answer two questions: First, how do different disciplines adopt and shape OA publishing practices? Second, what discipline-specific barriers to and potentials for OA can be identified? Methods: In a first step, we identified and synthesized relevant bibliometric studies that assessed OA prevalence and publishing patterns across disciplines. In a second step, and adopting a social shaping of technology perspective, we studied evidence on the socio-technical forces that shape OA publishing practices. We examined a variety of data sources, including, but not limited to, publisher policies and guidelines, OA mandates and policies and author surveys. Results: Over the last three decades, scholarly publishing has experienced a shift from closed access to OA as the proportion of scholarly literature that is openly accessible has increased continuously. Estimated OA levels for publication years after 2010 varied between 29.4% and 66%. The shift towards OA is uneven across disciplines in two respects: first, the growth of OA has been uneven across disciplines, which manifests itself in varying OA prevalence levels. Second, disciplines use different OA publishing channels to make research outputs OA. Conclusions: We conclude that historically rooted publishing practices differ in terms of their compatibility with OA, which is the reason why OA can be assumed to be a natural continuation of publishing cultures in some disciplines, whereas in other disciplines, the implementation of OA faces major barriers and would require a change of research culture.

AB  - INTRODUCTION A common concern about openly available electronic theses and dissertations is that their “openness” will prevent graduate student authors from publishing their work commercially in the future. A handful of studies have explored aspects of this topic; this study reviewed dissertation-to-book publication patterns at Carnegie Classification R1 academic institutions. METHODS This study analyzed over 23,000 dissertations from twelve U.S. universities to determine how frequently dissertations were subsequently published as books matching the original dissertation in pagination, chapters, and subject matter. WorldCat and several other resources were used to make publication determinations. RESULTS Across the sample set, a very small percentage of dissertations were published as books that matched the original dissertation on pagination, chapters, and subject matter. The average number of years for dissertations in the study to be published as books was determined for broad subject categories and for select academic disciplines. Results were compared across public and private institutions, and books that were self-published or published by questionable organizations were identified. DISCUSSION Dissertation-to-book trends occur primarily in the social sciences, humanities, and arts. With dissertations for which the author is actively working to publish as a book, the commonly offered 6- to 24-month embargo periods appear sufficient, provided that extensions or renewals continue to be available. CONCLUSION This study has implications for librarians providing services to graduate students, faculty advisors, and graduate colleges/schools in regard to dissertation embargo lengths, self-publishing, and what we have termed questionable publishers, as these areas continue to provide opportunities for librarians to educate these stakeholders.

AB  - Abstract The emergence of predatory journals is a global threat for scientific integrity, particularly in under-resourced settings such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A bilingual course on predatory publishing using a distance education approach was developed for Moroccan researchers as a response to the imperative need for training on research ethics to implement good scientific practices. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted to evaluate outcomes after delivering two education sessions in both French and English. Before this course, 40% of participants indicated that they don’t verify journal quality before manuscript submission and most of them consider Scopus indexing and the impact factor as the best criteria for journal publication. Approximately 50% of surveyees did not have previous information on predatory journals before the webinar. Pressure to publish by supervisors, institutions of affiliation, or funding agencies, was noticed in 43.4% of participants. After the webinar course was delivered, remarkably, the proportion of participants with knowledge on predatory publishing was meaningfully increased from 48.9% to 81%. Importantly, 83.7% of participants indicated that they are motivated to share their new knowledge on predatory publishing with their colleagues. Moreover, the majority of respondents (73.8%) reported that publishing their research in predatory journals may damage their career and professional future. Promisingly, nearly a half or more of participants recommended the use of training based on distance education, surveillance of researchers by their mentors and affiliations, and social networks to increase awareness on predatory publishing. Almost all participants were satisfied with the content of the webinar. Trainers and research institutions in LMICs should benefit from the advent of distance education using webinar platforms to increase awareness on the issue of predatory publishing in their settings.

AB  - Do we forget those whose voices we rarely hear? Publishers have been using technology to disseminate research since we started publishing, but we often focus on the mainstream needs and forget the perspectives and needs of those voices we rarely hear. This perpetuates disadvantage and reduces diversity throughout the publishing community. Such problems can be considered from two perspectives: the make-up of the publishing industry and the manner by which we disseminate publications. Within the publishing workforce, diversity imbalances have long been acknowledged, for example in the demographic data reported in 2016 (Greco, 2016). And there are too few initiatives to address these limitations, although some attempts are being made, for example the 2017 American Association of Publishers intern programme in partnership with the United Negro College Fund. Similar awareness regarding what and how we publish is less commonly recognized as a problem for inclusivity and broader access to knowledge. An estimated 285 million people throughout the world are thought to have serious visual impairment and another 360 million have deafness or hearing loss (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014). While these are among the most common sensory deficiencies, countless other limitations challenge disabled readers and prevent their access to informational resources. Fortunately, their needs have been recognized in some countries through legislation enforcing accessibility policy within higher education institutions and commercial website owners alike. The implications for publishers are huge. In a recent lawsuit, it was found that the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) websites run by the University of California, Berkeley were in breach of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In this case, the content was inaccessible to blind and deaf people, missing key features such as closed captions and screen-reader compatibility (Straumsheim, 2017). As result the University is currently in the process of taking down all MOOC content, including over 20,000 audio and video files because it is too expensive to make it compliant. With the huge growth of online publishing and digital resources, what must be done to ensure that publishers meet the requirements of legislation (and differences between countries), and is there more we can do? Is the publishing industry stepping up to its responsibilities? From voice recognition software to web-enabled devices, technological advances in content processing are extending the publisher's ability to ensure the broadest possible accessibility of their products, with interoperable formats to suit readers’ diverse needs and capabilities. Platform providers are including accessible download options and the latest updates to web publishing standards, like JATS and EPUB, comply with World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) requirements for access for the visually and motor impaired. So, why isn't every publication able to meet these basic standards? What risks are in play for publishers, libraries, and societies? Why are we still talking about accessibility? Our January 2018 special issue of Learned Publishing will be dedicated to answering these questions from a range of perspectives. Technologists will share the latest breakthroughs in digital workflows and hosting. Librarians will explain the current state of disabled student services on campuses around the world. And we expect to hear directly from readers and learn from their experiences with our products. Publishers can no longer burrow in the sand and hope that accessibility fixes itself. It only takes a bad day of hay fever or a broken arm for each one of us to realize that we are only temporarily abled. Gifts like sight, sound, and mobility are easily taken for granted, but any deterioration in these capabilities can drastically limit our ability to learn and engage with the world around us. As purveyors of the world's growing body of knowledge, publishers have a profound obligation to continually adapt our offerings to meet the needs of all readers, able bodied and otherwise. The January 2018 issue will highlight how national funding agencies and regional legislation require many institutions to provide fully accessible resources to their patrons, with strict legal penalties on academic libraries. Publisher platforms must keep up with accessibility standards and new initiatives are aimed at helping publishers establish a roadmap to conformance. Some content providers are beginning to realize the competitive benefits of inclusive, standards-compliant products. Ultimately, the goal of improved accessibility is rooted in the belief that publishing at its best is inclusive and supportive of the global exchange of knowledge and ideas. Issues of diversity are not limited to the visually impaired, as seen demonstrated in this current issue. Within scholarly publishing, we accept certain norms and terms of engagement. We often require our authors, readers, researchers, and other publishers to conform to these standard practices. It is worth examining these assumptions occasionally, questioning whether they introduce separation and elitism, whether they limit or promote accessibility. Do we enable access for all qualified potential authors, even if language barriers prevent a submission from meeting a journal's standards? Or for readers, who do not understand nuances of language and may misinterpret or misunderstand what is published? See, for example, the article by Sarwat Nauman in this issue, which discusses a research crisis in Pakistan caused by differing educational and cultural values (Nauman, 2017). And, whilst it may appear that there is consensus among researchers, the most recent findings from the Harbingers project reveals subtle differences between early career researchers around the world, particularly with publishing and authorship practices (Nicholas et al., 2017). David Brown (2017) questions if we need new approaches for development of STEM information, which will allow for discovery, access, and reuse of scientific knowledge in a diverse world. Finally, Schmaling and Blume (2017) report on gender differences in peer reviewing, demonstrating that we must regularly examine our biases and work toward a more inclusive global publishing community. It is a big world out there, with an amazing array of people and cultures. Valuing those diverse voices – and ensuring that we allow them to participate in knowledge creation and consumption – is foundational to a healthy society and, while we live in a technically connected world, our core values of humanity must be maintained. It is our responsibility to keep diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility at the heart of our publishing programmes and our professional discourse. P. Smart L. Conrad

AB  - In the ever-evolving landscape of scholarly communication, research impact assessment has expanded beyond traditional citation metrics. Altmetrics, which encompass a wide range of online indicators like social media mentions, downloads, and blog posts, provide insights into the broader societal engagement with scholarly works. This study explores the relationship between Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) and traditional citation metrics within the Library and Information Sciences (LIS) domain, focusing on high CiteScore open-access journals. The study collected bibliographic data of top 100 articles from Dimensions.ai database that were published between 2013 and 2022 and assesses the alignment between scholarly recognition and online engagement. The top 100 articles were selected based on highest AAS to focus on the most influential and widely-discussed research in order to provide a comprehensive overview of current trends and impactful findings in the field. The dissemination pattern of research highlights across various social web platforms is examined, shedding light on the diverse channels through which research reaches audiences. Correlation analysis reveals a weak and statistically insignificant connection between AAS and citations for the studied journals, emphasising the nuanced nature of scholarly impact in today’s digital landscape. The findings underscore the need to consider both traditional and alternative metrics when evaluating research influence and engagement in the evolving scholarly communication paradigm of the digital age. While this study is confined to specific journals within the LIS domain, its insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of research impact assessment.&#x0D;

AB  - Abstract Introduction We approach the problem of "predatory" journals and publishers from the perspective of small scientific communities and small journals that may sometimes be perceived as "predatory". Among other characteristics of "predatory" journals two most relevant are their business model and the quality of the editorial work. Materials and methods We analysed 444 Croatian open access (OA) journals in the Hrčak (portal of Croatian scientific journals) digital journal repository for the presence of article processing charges as a business model and the transparency of editorial policies. Results The majority of journals do not charge authors or require submission or article processing charges, which clearly distinguishes them from "predatory" journals. Almost all Hrčak OA journals have publicly available information on editorial boards, including full names and affiliations, and detailed contact information for the editorial office at the Hrčak website. The journal names are unique and cannot be easily confused with another journal or intend to mislead about the journal's origin. While most journals provide information on peer review process, many do not provide guidelines for reviewers or other editorial and publication ethics standards. Conclusion In order to clearly differentiate themselves from predatory journals, it is not enough for journals from small research communities to operate on non-commercial bases, but also to have transparent editorial policies.

AB  - As part of moves towards open knowledge practices, making peer review open is cited as a way to enable fuller scrutiny and transparency of assessments around research. There are now many flavours of open peer review in use across scholarly publishing, including where reviews are fully attributable and the reviewer is named. This study examines whether there is any evidence of bias in two areas of common critique of open, non-anonymous (named) peer review – and used in the post-publication, peer review system operated by the open-access scholarly publishing platform F1000Research. First, is there evidence of potential bias where a reviewer based in a specific country assesses the work of an author also based in the same country? Second, are reviewers influenced by being able to see the comments and know the origins of a previous reviewer? Based on over 4 years of open peer review data, we found some weak evidence that being based in the same country as an author may influence a reviewer’s decision, while there was insufficient evidence to conclude that being able to read an existing published review prior to submitting a review encourages conformity. Thus, while immediate publishing of peer review reports appears to be unproblematic, caution may be needed when selecting same-country reviewers in open systems if other studies confirm these results.

AB  - In academia, there is a growing acceptance of sharing the final electronic version of graduate work, such as a thesis or dissertation, in an online university repository. Though previous studies have shown that journal editors are willing to consider manuscripts derived from electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), faculty advisors and graduate students continue to raise concerns that online discoverability of ETDs negatively impact future opportunities to publish those findings. The current study investigated science journal policies on open access ETDs and found that more than half of the science journals responding (51.4%) reported that manuscripts derived from openly accessible ETDs are welcome for submission and an additional 29.1 percent would accept revised ETDs under certain conditions.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the educational value of prestigious and productive Spanish scholarly publishers based on mentions of their books in online scholarly syllabi. Design/methodology/approach Syllabus mentions of 15,117 books from 27 publishers were searched for, manually checked and compared with Microsoft Academic (MA) citations. Findings Most books published by Ariel, Síntesis, Tecnos and Cátedra have been mentioned in at least one online syllabus, indicating that their books have consistently high educational value. In contrast, few books published by the most productive publishers were mentioned in online syllabi. Prestigious publishers have both the highest educational impact based on syllabus mentions and the highest research impact based on MA citations. Research limitations/implications The results might be different for other publishers. The online syllabus mentions found may be a small fraction of the syllabus mentions of the sampled books. Practical implications Authors of Spanish-language social sciences and humanities books should consider general prestige when selecting a publisher if they want educational uptake for their work. Originality/value This is the first study assessing book publishers based on syllabus mentions.

AB  - Title and abstractThink of an “appetizing” title that should be as brief as possible but also representative of your contents. A good title, consisting of carefully selected, albeit ‘hot’, words is your ticket to citations. I have come across many papers of mediocre content but with hundreds of citations, just because the author was smart enough to choose the right words in the title. Unfortunately, life is not always serious and more often than not—and for longevity- it shouldn’t be taken too seriously either.Footnote 5 To the extent possible, your Abstract (200–250 words) should be written in non-technical language, aimed at the general reader, and it should not include references or footnotes. This is the most important part of your paper, and the one that everybody will read; it needs to convince the reader that the paper is worth reading. In non-technical language, explain to the reader why you wrote this paper; who has asked for it; what do you add to existing knowledge; what is your methodology; what are your main conclusions. Remember: your abstract is something very different from your introduction, which will probably follow. Thus, do not duplicate.

AB  - Abstract The aging of the professoriate throughout the end of the twentieth century and the early years of the 2000′s (both before and after the end of mandatory retirement in the United States, ca. 1994) has become a source of concern for some scholars and research administrators, who posit that the “greying” of the academy results in lower research activity and a decline in scientific advancement. Some published opinions concur that senior scholars’ research programs do not keep pace with those of their younger colleagues, but little quantitative evidence has been presented to evaluate that claim. In this study, we quantify senior faculty publication activity in six broad fields, comparing their publication rates to their younger colleagues across four modes of knowledge dissemination: journal articles, conference proceedings, books, and book chapters. Career publication activity does not follow the “peak and decline” pattern described in earlier studies. In most fields, journal article publication rates do not decline substantively with age (and in some cases article publication rates are higher among senior scholars), conference proceeding publication rates tend to decline with age, while book and chapter publication rates increase markedly with age. Overall, senior scholars maintain publishing activity levels and tend to shift their focus to the development and evolution of ideas through the publication of longer-format works as books and book chapters.

AB  - Much of the argument around reforming, remaking, or preserving the traditions of scholarly publishing is built on economic principles, explicit or implicit. Can we afford open access (OA)? How do we pay for high‐quality services? Why does it cost so much? In this article, we argue that the sterility of much of this debate is a result of failure to tackle the question of what a journal is in economic terms. We offer a way through by demonstrating that a journal is a club and discuss the implications for the scholarly publishing industry. We use examples, ranging from OA to prestige journals, to explain why congestion is a problem for club‐based publications, and to discuss the importance of creative destruction for the maintenance of knowledge‐generating communities in publishing.

AB  - Around 170 early career researchers (ECRs) from 8 countries were interviewed about the whole range of their scholarly communication attitudes/behaviours during pandemic times and this paper analyses what they said about predatory journals in a wide range of scholarly communication contexts. Because of the delicacy of the topic there was just one question exclusively directed at predatory journals, which asked about policies rather than actions, which yielded nevertheless wide-ranging comments on the topic. ECRs also volunteered information on predatory journals in another half dozen questions, most notably including one on questionable research practices. The source of data was mainly the final interview of three undertaken, with some comparisons made to rounds one and two. Findings disclose the existence of a whole raft of formal and informal assessment policies/coded that direct ECRs to legitimate journals and away from predatory ones. Despite being junior, ECRs are very accultured to the criteria of what is considered as prestige and quality and believe predatory publishing is not even conceivable. They are far more concerned about low-quality research, preprints and borderline ‘grey’ journals. The pandemic has increased the level of questionable practices and low-quality research, but predatory journals were only singled out by a relatively small number of ECRs.

AB  - A knowledge economy has been defined as one in which the generation and exploitation of knowledge has come to play the predominant part in the creation of wealth. It is not simply about pushing back the frontiers of knowledge; it is also about the more effective use and exploitation of all types of knowledge in all manner of economic activities. One key question is whether there are new opportunities and new models for scholarly publishing that might better serve researchers and more effectively communicate and disseminate research findings. Building on previous work, this paper looks at the costs and potential benefits of alternative models for scientific and scholarly publishing, describing the approach and methods used and summarising the findings of a study undertaken for JISC in the United Kingdom. It concludes that different publishing models can make a material difference to the costs faced by and benefits realised from research communication, and it seems likely that more open access would have substantial net benefits.

AB  - Traditionally, there have been two important media of academic publishing: scholarly journals and scholarly books. The first scholarly journal, the Journal des Sçavans, was founded by Denis de Sallo, appeared already in January 1665 in Paris, reappeared after the French Revolution as the Journal des Savants, and still exists as a leading journal in the humanities. Only a few weeks later, Henry Oldenbourg, the first secretary of the Royal Society of London, established a second scholarly journal, the Philosophical Transactions, with a focus on science. The purpose of these journals was to formalize the extensive correspondence between philosophers and scientists.1 In the 18th and the 19th century, more specialized journals gained in importance, most of which were published by learned societies. At the end of the 19th century, university presses too began to publish scholarly journals. Another traditional means of academic publishing are the various types of scholarly books, in particular monographs, edited volumes, reference works (specialist dictionaries, encyclopedias, and specialty reference manuals), and technical handbooks.2 A narrow definition of academic works would exclude textbooks and books for the broader public. Shavell (2010, 337–39) employs four criteria to determine whether a journal or book is academic in nature: (1) the authors and/or the publisher are usually academics; (2) the readers are mainly academics; (3) the content is academic in character; (4) only low royalties are paid, if any. As of today, scholarly journals are the preferred mode of academic publishing in particular in the sciences and some social sciences (e.g., economics), whereas scholarly books still play an important role in the arts, the humanities, and part of the social sciences. Whereas scholarly books are published by a large number of small national publishers in a multitude of languages, the most important scholarly journals are typically in English language and published by a few large commercial publishers. Until the mid-20th century, the most important journals were published by learned societies, before commercial publishers began to enter the academic publishing market in the 1960s and 1970s by launching new titles or acquiring existing ones. This development has led to a significant concentration of (commercial) publishers in the academic journal market.3 It is difficult to say for sure how many scholarly journals are available around the world. Some sources speak of more than 100,000, others of 87,000 or 73,000.4 In August 2018, Ulrich's Web Directory listed 33,119 active scholarly peer-reviewed English-language journals with about 3 million articles a year, complemented by an additional 9,372 journals in other languages. As an important subset, 11,655 journals with 2.2 million articles were included in the Clarivate Analytics' Journal Citation Reports (STM, 2018, 25–26). The Web of Science (WoS) database counted almost 12,500 journals in 2019 (see below, Section 2.2.1). With the mass expansion of academic education and the increasing size of faculty after World War II, publications in peer-reviewed, highly ranked journals have become an important precondition for academic careers in many disciplines, in particular in the sciences, economics, and partly in the other social sciences. In 1964, Eugene Garfield launched the Science Citation Index to calculate the impact factors of journals in science, medicine, and technology. This index was later followed by the Social Sciences Citation Index in 1973, the Arts & Humanities Citation Index in 1978 (Regazzi, 2015, 86–88), and the Emerging Sources Citation Index in 2015. These indices led to the development of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF), a metric that serves to rank a scholarly journal based on the number of citations to articles in that journal by articles in other indexed journals within a certain time period. During the same time, commercial publishers have increased their market shares to the detriment of non-for-profit publishers, such as learned societies and universities, becoming the dominant players in the market for scholarly journals. Today, the "big five" commercial academic publishers—Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, and Sage—cover more than half of the market for scholarly journals. Since the 1980s, we have seen a sharp increase not just in the number of journals but in particular also in journal subscription prices, forcing many academic libraries to cancel serials subscriptions and to cut back on new monographs (the so-called serials crisis, cf. Eger & Scheufen, 2018, 23–29). These developments induced an increasing number of scholars, initially in the United States, to promote open access (OA) to scholarly articles as a replacement of or an addendum to the subscription model. After some individual initiatives in the late 1980s, the early 2000s saw the emergence of a global movement by scholars, librarians, and research sponsors, resulting in the "Budapest Open Access Initiative" (February 2002), the "Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing" (June 2003) and the "Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities" (October 2003).7 Two roads to OA can be distinguished8: First, gold OA refers to electronic journals with OA for all readers, often based on creative commons licenses. The publishers' costs are covered not by subscription fees but from other sources, such as article-processing charges (APCs)9 paid by authors, libraries, learned societies, or research sponsors, or subsidies from learned societies and other sources. Hybrid OA journals, whose numbers are rising fast, allow the authors to choose between paying an APC, thereby granting the reader OA, or not paying an APC and requiring the reader to pay for access to the article.10 A special branch of gold OA is mega-journals, the first one of which, PLOS One, was first published in 2006. In these journals, the peer review is restricted to examining only the soundness of the submitted articles but not their broader interest or impact. Also, mega-journals are not oriented towards a specific subject matter. The second road, green OA, refers to authors self-archiving pre-prints or post-prints of their papers on so-called OA repositories, potentially in addition to publication in traditional subscription-based journals. OpenDOAR listed 5,713 repositories in July 2021, of which 5,073 were classified as institutional repositories managed by universities, faculties, or other academic institutions, 364 as disciplinary (subject) repositories which aggregate research papers in specific disciplines (e.g., PubMed Central, arXiv, SSRN, and RepEc), 138 as aggregating repositories (including Academia and Scielo), and 139 as governmental repositories.11 Whereas institutional and disciplinary repositories generally respect the authors' or publishers' copyright, so-called Robin Hood or Pirate OA repositories do not. The most prominent example is Sci-Hub, founded in 2011 by Alexandra Elbakyan, a young scholar from Kazakhstan, which made over 60 million journal articles publicly available. Due to complaints by academic publishers, Sci-Hub had to switch domains several times.12 Recent years have seen the emergence of academic social networks such as Research Gate and Mendeley, as well as a stream of new forms of disseminating scientific content, including blogs, podcasts, and Facebook posts by prominent scholars. Regarding OA books, the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) in June 2021 listed 43,036 academic peer-reviewed books from 621 publishers.13 The number of academic journals, as listed in the WoS database, has been growing steadily over the past two decades, from around 5,000 in 2000 to almost 12,500 in 2019 (Figure 1).14 Source: Author's calculations based on data from Web of Science (2021) The academic journal market is dominated by a few large commercial publishers, with the "big five" accounting for more than half of the academic journals listed by the WoS in 2019: Elsevier (1,754 journals), Springer (1,406), Wiley Blackwell (1,242), Taylor & Francis (1,199), and Sage (642).15 However, due to a downturn by Elsevier that began around 2006, this dominance has declined from around 60% in 2000 to around 51.7% in 2019 (Figure 2). Source: Author's calculations based on data from Web of Science (2021) Coupled with the advent of the internet and the concurrent increasing digitization of academic works, which through the bundling of different journals and/or formats ("big deals") facilitated second-degree price discrimination, this dominance has led to a drastic increase in subscription prices since the early 1990s (Bergstrom, 2013; Eger & Scheufen, 2018; Ramello, 2010). The resulting serials crisis—with academic libraries having to cut their journal portfolio—gave rise to a new publishing regime that offers OA to journal content. The share of pure (i.e., non-hybrid) OA journals as listed by the Directory of Open Access Journals (2021) has been increasing steadily, from around 3% of all WoS-listed journals in 2000 to more than 10% in 2019 (Figure 3). Source: Author's calculations based on data from Web of Science (2021) and DOAJ (2021) Interestingly, pure OA journals also gained ground in terms of quality. Figure 4 shows boxplots of the impact factors16 of closed access (CA) versus OA journals over time. While CA journals enjoyed an impact factor advantage over OA journals for a long time—all location scales of the impact factor for CA journals being above the ones for OA journals—OA journals are nowadays of the same quality, notwithstanding considerable differences between disciplines (see the contribution by Eger et al. to this issue). In 2019, impact factor distributions of both OA and CA journals are at the same level. Thus, advancing both in quantity and in quality, OA journals are becoming ever more relevant. The literature has identified the following advantages of an OA regime for academic works: (1) OA publications are likely read and therefore (2) cited more widely,17 which in turn (3) raises the incentives for academic authors to publish their research results as citations increase their reputation. These observations led to a broad discussion in academia as to whether the copyright regime may impede the evolution towards a universal OA regime, with very different conclusions being drawn regarding the impact of OA from a social welfare perspective (Scheufen, 2015; Shavell, 2010). Source: Author's calculations based on data from Web of Science (2021) and DOAJ (2021) The growing relevance of academic OA publishing warrants a closer look at the development of pure OA journals as the gold road towards OA. Figure 5 shows the number of newly launched OA journals from 2002 to 2020. Following relatively slow growth from 2002 to 2014, with fewer than 500 new OA journals per year (except 2013), the number has exceeded 1,000 in every year since, peaking in 2017, when more than 2,000 new OA journals were added to the DOAJ database. Today, the DOAJ database counts more than 16,000 OA journals in many different fields of research, published in 80 languages by publishers from 126 countries.18 Source: Author's calculations based on data from DOAJ (2021) Notwithstanding this impressive development, the relevance of OA journals varies substantially across academic disciplines (Figure 6).19 The research field with the largest attributed number of OA journals is Social Sciences (3,817), followed by Health Sciences (2,785), Technology and Engineering (1,416), and Language and Literature (1,153). By contrast, the natural science fields of Mathematics & Statistics (341), Physics & Astronomy (274), and Chemistry (181) feature only few OA journals.20 Source: Author's calculations based on data from DOAJ (2021) Remarkable differences also exist regarding a variety of OA journal characteristics (Table 1).21 Most (52%) OA journals leave the copyright of published works with the author, whereas the traditional CA regime demands that the exploitation rights are transferred to the publisher. Moreover, only around 28% of all OA journals charge APCs—a remarkable finding, as the OA regime implies the transition from a "reader pays" to an "author pays" model. Other fees (e.g., a submission fee to cover the review process) are charged by only around 2% of all OA journals. Nevertheless, author fees may constitute a significant obstacle for authors to publish in an OA venue, especially for non-tenured researchers seeking to publish in highly ranked journals, which are most likely to charge APCs (Budzinski et al., 2020). This obstacle also applies in particular to many researchers from developing countries, whose institutions rarely cover such costs. Yet 18% of OA journals provide for the possibility to waive such author fees. OA publishing may indeed be considered a form of development aid, for two reasons: First, few institutions in the developing world have so far been able to subscribe to academic journals. The OA regime can thus promote scientific participation and thereby foster the global evolution of science as a "trial and error" process. Free or cheaper access to literature for researchers in the developing world tends to increase both their output (number of publications) and input (number of references) (Mueller-Langer et al., 2020). Second, an OA regime grants access to the latest results in science for groups who were previously excluded because they are not "club" members of a university library. This includes, e.g., corporate researchers, physicians, or farmers. Notwithstanding all the changes discussed above, scholarly journals remain the most important medium of communication in many disciplines. For more than 300 years, they have been fulfilling the four key functions of registration (attribution), certification of articles (peer review), dissemination (distribution, access), and preservation (scholarly memory and permanent archiving). In recent decades, a fifth function must be added: the evaluation of researchers and their institutions.22 The increasing importance of OA articles in scholarly journals has triggered some controversial discussions, in particular regarding the questions as to whether OA negatively affects the quality of journal articles, whether OA improves the dissemination of research results, and how OA affects the competition between academic publishers as well as the distribution between academics and non-academics, between poor and rich universities, and between poor and rich countries. We shall discuss each of these questions and some related points in more detail below. In times when "alternative facts" tend to trump sound research results, academia must provide the public with reliable information. The users of this information should be sufficiently certain that the results are based on proper methods, reflect the state of science in the specific field, and were obtained independently, e.g., of any political or commercial interests.23 For that reason, strict and continuous quality control of research results is a "conditio sine qua non" for academic publishing. Facilitating the communication of content from authors to readers, the academic journal market may be characterized as a two-sided market (Rochet & Tirole, 2003). While readers look for the most important research results in their fields by top authors, the latter are interested in the journal's reputation, in wide readership, and in citations. Thus, journals with high impact factors hold the greatest attraction to both sides. With this in mind, the crucial question arises what effect, if any, OA is likely to have on the quality of academic articles. Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado in Denver, is very skeptical regarding the quality of OA articles, especially those that are financed by APCs: "By adding a financial component to the front end of the scholarly publishing process, the open-access movement will ultimately corrupt scholarly publishing and hurt the communication and sharing of novel knowledge" (Beall, 2013, 590). A weak form of "corruption" would refer to OA publishers' incentives to neglect rigorous peer review and to accept more submitted papers in order to increase revenues from APCs.24 However, the commercial publishers' incentives to increase the number of articles to the detriment of the journal's quality vanishes at the point where the quality degradation actually reduces the APCs that the journal is able to charge, as well as publisher's profits (Shavell, 2010, 334). A stronger form of "corruption" refers to the "new business model" of "predatory publishing," where some OA journal publishers have been known to exploit in particular young and inexperienced scholars who depend on publications for their careers, or to allow experienced authors to publish low-quality articles in OA journals, by accepting articles with little or no peer review, listing academics on editorial boards without their permission, mimicking the name or website style of reputable journals, and so on. In 2010, Beall established a list of predatory publishers, which was regularly updated until it went offline in January 2017 in response to heavy criticism not only from the publishers concerned but also from OA advocates who argued that Beall exaggerated the problem to suit his general ideological objection to OA. From today's perspective, this quality problem seems to be a transitory one which exists only in some disciplines (e.g., economics), whereas in other disciplines, such as biology, some OA journals are among the highest ranked journals and there is no evidence whatsoever of a systematic quality gap.25 If senior researchers warn their younger colleagues and if academic institutions and research sponsors refuse to finance the APCs for articles accepted by predatory journals, this business model is bound to vanish. A further concern voiced by Beall is that OA may discriminate against new and unpopular ideas: "Popular ideas will receive funding; new and unpopular ideas, regardless of their merit, will remain unfunded" (Beall, 2013, 590). However, this problem is a general consequence of the peer-review process, regardless of whether the paper was submitted to a traditional or an OA journal. Gans and Shephard (1994) list many prominent examples which suggest that mainstream articles are generally more likely to pass the review process than original and creative but heterodox ones. In their contribution to this special issue, Watt & Mueller-Langer show in a two-sided model that OA can be a feature of high-quality journals. The last decades have seen an increasing availability both of data on virtually any subject and of software that serves to process that data almost instantaneously. Consequently, there has been a surge of empirical articles in practically every discipline. For such articles, besides the well-established pre-publication peer review, another option for quality assurance becomes available: post-publication replication studies.26 A distinction can be made between pure replication, where the same data and the same methods are used as in the original study, and scientific replication, which uses either (1) different data but the same method, (2) the same data but new methods, or (3) new data and new methods. A researcher's incentive to conduct a replication study depends on (1) the probability of detecting an error or fraud in previously published findings, (2) the impact of the article under scrutiny, (3) the cost of replication, and (4) the willingness of editors to publish replication studies. Whereas some 50 years ago, when data were saved on punch cards, the cost of replication consisted mainly of technical barriers, today copyright protection and data disclosure policies are the main determinants of replication cost.27 Regarding point (4), the first journals specializing in replication studies have already been established, including Experimental Results, an OA journal by Cambridge University Press with a focus on Science, Technology and Medicine, and the International Journal for Re-Views in Empirical Economics by Springer Nature. Over the last 15 years or so, a number of replication studies in several disciplines have revealed that the results of many original studies, even when published in highly ranked journals, could not be replicated, prompting many academics to speak of a "replication crisis."28 The challenge is to improve the quality of empirical research by easier access to data so as to be able to correct wrongful results of empirical studies ex post and deter fraud or simply carelessness ex ante, without destroying the incentives to conduct the original study in the first place. Another important question is whether digitization and the internet have facilitated the quality assessment of academics, of their scholarly and societal impact, and of their institutions. Currently, the quality assessment of academic researchers and of entire universities is largely based on JIFs, which were "originally designed to provide a metric for journals competing with each other" (European Commission, 2019, 52), being a measure of the average citations to all articles in a journal volume but not of the citations to the individual articles. In practice, a few articles are cited frequently, and many articles are not cited at all.29 Moreover, an article may also attract many citations for being inadequate, and citations are easily manipulated (Anderson, 2018, 183–191). For example, some journals encourage the authors of submitted papers to cite related papers that were previously published in the same journal (self-citations). Others have extended this practice by coordinating the effort of several journals (citation cartels).30 Overall, this focus on JIFs induces scholars and their universities to adapt their performance and the allocation of resources to these output-oriented measures and leads to distortions with detrimental consequences for the quality of research (Osterloh & Frey, 2014). Quite in line with Goodhart's Law—"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" (STM, 2018, 67)—scholars are induced to "hit the target but miss the point." The Leiden Manifesto on research metrics, which originated from the Leiden International Conference on Science and Technology Indicators in September 2014, is likewise critical of the existing metrics to assess research output and instead formulates 10 principles to guide research evaluation in the future (Hicks et al., 2015).These discussions raise the question whether the new technologies (digitization and the internet) and business models (OA) of academic publishing enable superior methods to assess scholars and their institutions. Some authors see the future in OA publishing with a broader base of readers and open post-publication evaluation. For example, Randy Schekman of UC Berkeley, the 2013 Nobel laureate in biology, criticizes the focus on a small number of highly ranked luxury journals, arguing instead for a system where all articles that meet a journal's editorial criteria should be published and made freely available, financed by APCs or other revenues. This is essentially the strategy of mega-journals such as PLOS One (Schekman, 2013). From a similar perspective, James Heckman, who shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Economics, and Siddarth Moktan (Heckman & Moktan, 2020) examined the relationship between placement of publications in the top five journals in economics and receipt of tenure in economics departments. They detect a "tyranny of the top five journals", which favors careerism over creativity. From the readers' perspective, the crucial question is how to find relevant high-quality articles at low search costs, especially in a situation where OA vastly expands the set of freely available articles to choose from. Discipline-specific journal rankings of course reduce search costs to some extent. However, the inadequacy of the JIF as a measure of article quality has been duly noted. Thus, an important challenge to academic publishing is to provide reliable signals on the quality of journal articles that are independent of the journal that published the article. Digitization, the internet and alternative metrics for research evaluation also affect how research results are disseminated. Regarding scholarly impact, i.e., reception by other researchers, there is an ongoing discussion as to whether OA articles receive more or fewer citations than those with a paywall. Evidence to that effect is presented in the contributions by McCabe & Snyder and by Eger et al. to this special issue. Regarding societal impact, i.e., reception by the broader public, the classical, mainly citation-based bibliometrics is increasingly being complemented with altmetrics, which relies on tweets, likes, mentions, or downloads in the social media, online reference managers such as Zotero and Mendeley, scholarly blogs, and online repositories.33 In the gradual transition from traditional subscription journals to OA, the crucial question is how to manage the tightrope walk between two evils: On the one hand, high subscription fees may simply be replaced with high APCs.34 Powerful journal publishers merely have to adapt their business model to continue exploiting the universities or research sponsors. On the other hand, low APCs may not suffice for publishers to cover their cost and to earn a reasonable profit, giving them no incentive to publish high-cost journals. The challenge is to establish sufficient competition to induce journal publishers to process articles of certified quality at minimal cost and disseminate them fast and cheaply to the interested public. The level of competition depends not least on the economic and legal environment of OA publishing. If there were only pure OA journals, publishers would compete for good submissions. If all authors had to cover the APCs from their personal funds, the APCs would tend towards a level that enables the publishers to earn normal profits. However, in the real world, publishers of pure OA journals, hybrid OA journals and CA journals co-exist with OA repositories, and APCs may be subsidized by universities or research sponsors. Under these conditions, different regulatory strategies to foster OA will have specific effects on the level of APCs. Here are some examples: (1) If green OA is promoted via mandates or an inalienable right to secondary publication, as has been the case in Germany since January 2014, publishers of subscription journals find it difficult to increase their fees. This could also deter the publishers of OA journals from increasing their APCs. In any event, a discipline-specific embargo period must be set: If it is too short, it will undermine the publishers' incentive to publish the journal in the first place; if it is too long, the effect on subscription fees will be minimal. A mandate for gold OA by research funders could even strengthen the bargaining position of the publishers of OA journals and thereby increase APCs.35 (2) If excellent scholars support the establishment of new OA journals, this could foster competition among publishers of OA journals for good authors. Yet this strategy faces the problem that it takes many years to establish a good reputation and to attract excellent authors. Until then, the new journal will have little effect on the APCs/subscription fees of the incumbent journals. (3) Consortia of academic libraries can constitute a countervailing power to the big journal publishers, potentially restricting the level of APCs. One example is the DEAL project in Germany, which so far comprises two "transformational agreements" between a consortium of most academic libraries in Germany on the one hand and Wiley and Springer as big publishers of scholarly journals in all disciplines on the other hand. There is a controversial discussion whether such agreements impede competition on the journal market to the detriment of small publishers or indeed strengthen competition. In any event, such agreements seem to promote the transformation of traditional CA journals into hybrid OA journals.36 OA publishing may entail several distributional effects: First and foremost, the shift from "reader pays" to "author pays" can create obstacles for poorly funded researchers, for example, in developing countries. As we have seen, 18% of OA journals offer APC waivers for such researchers. Second, unilateral or country-specific steps to foster OA, such as the DEAL project mentioned above, may lead to the overrepresentation of researchers who enjoy support to the detriment of those who do not. Moreover, publishers may be reluctant to accept papers from researchers from countries that put author fees under specific pressure, e.g., by awarding authors an inalienable right of secondary publication. Third, mandatory gold and/or green OA may create distributional effects due to path dependencies that originate from discipline-specific incentives mechanisms, such as the reward structure in science or cultural features. Accordingly, especially for non-tenured researchers, mandatory gold OA may harm their careers in fields where OA cannot yet compete with well-established and esteemed CA journals.37 An example for distortion effects due to cultural features may be the Ingelfinger rule, e.g., in the field of Biology. In this regard, a (forced) green OA publication may conflict with a publication of a work in a journal since the Ingelfinger rule prevents that a journal publishes works that have been published elsewhere. In general, the transition to OA journals implies that authors or their sponsors pay for the ability of readers from all over the world to freely access the articles. This outcome may be undesirable whenever predominantly poor authors write for predominantly rich readers. Then, the global budget that is available to finance academic articles is allocated inefficiently, in which case the transition to OA may reduce the number of articles published. The problem is exacerbated when many of the readers are employed outside of academia.38 Generally, however, we can assume that universities whose faculty publish many articles also account for a large share of the readership, in which case any redistribution between authors and readers (or their sponsors) as a consequence of the transition to OA should be limited. A number of technological, economic and legal developments since the second half of the 20th century have dramatically changed the academic publishing market and triggered discussions about the very future of academic publishing. Academic journals, which in most disciplines continue to be the most important medium of academic communication, are increasingly owned by commercial publishers, with the top five publishers currently selling more than 50% of all journals. Digitization and the advent of the internet have allowed these publishers to engage in "big deals" with academic libraries, selling bundles of licenses which entitle the libraries to access a wide range of journals at a fixed price per year. As a result, journal subscription prices and academic libraries' expenditure on academic journals have been dramatically increasing to the detriment of smaller publishers and expenditure on books ("serials crisis"). To cope with these problems, a number of national and international initiatives triggered the development towards OA, a new business model of academic publishing. Today, a rapidly growing number of pure and hybrid OA journals are no longer financed by subscription fees but instead by publication fees paid by the authors or their sponsors (gold road). Moreover, institutional and disciplinary OA repositories have been established (green road), and the traditional channels of academic communication have been supplemented with social media, blogs, etc. Another consequence of digitization and the internet has been the strongly facilitated collection and processing of data, boosting empirical research in many disciplines. The downside of this development is an increasing number of cases where the results of quantitative studies cannot be replicated ("replication crisis"). Solving this problem would require coping with copyright and data-protection issues and motivating academic authors to engage in replication studies. The discussion continues as to how these developments affect the quality control of academic journal articles, the evaluation of scholars and their institutions, and the size and allocation of financial means for academic publishing. This special issue adds to the discussion a set of articles dealing with some of its central aspects, including the evaluation of scholars by scientometric indices (Ramello & Migheli), welfare effects of mandatory open access (Watt & Müller-Langer), the citation impact of OA (McCabe & Snyder; Eger, Mertens, & Scheufen), access to research data (Handke, Guibault, & Vallbé), "Plan S" to support OA in Europe (Armstrong), and the DEAL Project to support OA in Germany (Haucap, Moshgbar, & Schmal). We would like to thank Sönke Häseler for valuable comments. The authors also acknowledge open access funding by project DEAL. n/a.

AB  - The BioOne database of scholarly journals in the biological and ecological sciences was established in the belief that broad and enduring access to scholarly literature is essential not just to the health of the scientific enterprise but also to the health of the wider society in which science is practiced. The prevailing model of profit-based journal publishing – in which high prices are impeding access – is harming the interests of the very scientists who provide its life-blood. The BioOne business model seeks to meet the interlocking goals of providing broad and enduring access, supporting the publishing enterprise of scholarly societies, and assuring that BioOne will keep pace with changes in technology and scientific communication.

AB  - The extent of publishing in predatory journals in economics is examined. A simple model of researcher behavior is presented to explore those factors motivating an academic to publish in predatory journals as defined by Beall (Criteria for determining predatory open access publishers, Unpublished document, 3rd edn, 2015. https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ ). Beall's lists are used to identify predatory journals included in the Research Papers in Economics archives. The affiliations of authors publishing in these outlets indicate that the geographic dispersion of authorship is widespread. A very small subset of authors is registered on RePEc. A surprising number of authors who are in the RePEc top 5% also published in predatory journals in 2015.

AB  - Summary Lack of diversity on editorial boards might generate disparities in editorial and peer review that contribute to gender and geographic disparities in scholarly publishing. We use a comprehensive data set of the peer review process for all papers submitted to the journal Functional Ecology from January 2004 to June 2014 to examine how gender, seniority and geographic location of editors and reviewers influence reviewer recruitment and scores given to papers by reviewers. The gender ratio of editors for Functional Ecology was majority male, but the proportion of female editors increased over time. The gender ratio of selected reviewers was also highly majority male, but the proportion of women selected as reviewers increased over the 10 years largely because the number of women on the editorial board increased and female editors invited more female reviewers than did male editors. Male editors selected &lt;25% female reviewers even in the year they selected the most women, but female editors consistently selected ˜30–35% female reviewers. Editors also over‐selected reviewers from their own geographic locality. Women invited to review were less likely to respond to review invitations, but more likely to accept if they responded. Women invited to review responded to the invitation similarly regardless of whether the editor inviting them was male or female, but men invited to review were both less likely to respond and more likely to decline if the editor was female. Review scores given to papers did not differ between male and female reviewers, and final decisions (proportion of papers rejected) did not differ between male and female editors. The proportion of women among selected reviewers decreased with editor seniority when the editor was male but increased with editor seniority when the editor was female. Thus, the gender ratio of selected reviewers differed little between early‐career male and female editors but differed a lot between late‐career (more senior) male and female editors. Individuals invited to review were less likely to agree to review if the editor was more senior. Editor gender, seniority and geographic location affect who is invited to review for Functional Ecology , and how invitees respond to review invitations, but not the final outcome of the peer review process. To increase diversity of reviewer populations, journals should increase gender, age and geographic diversity of their editorial boards.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the role of science and technology studies (STS) journal editors in organizing and maintaining the peer review economy. We specifically conceptualize peer review as a gift economy running on perpetually renewed experiences of mutual indebtedness among members of an intellectual community. While the peer review system is conventionally presented as self-regulating, we draw attention to its vulnerabilities and to the essential curating function of editors. Aside from inherent complexities, there are various shifts in the broader political-economic and sociotechnical organization of scholarly publishing that have recently made it more difficult for editors to organize robust cycles of gift exchange. This includes the increasing importance of journal metrics and associated changes in authorship practices; the growth and differentiation of the STS journal landscape; and changes in publishing funding models and the structure of the publishing market through which interactions among authors, editors, and reviewers are reconfigured. To maintain a functioning peer review economy in the face of numerous pressures, editors must balance contradictory imperatives: the need to triage intellectual production and rely on established cycles of gift exchange for efficiency, and the need to expand cycles of gift exchange to ensure the sustainability and diversity of the peer review economy.

AU  - Dawson, Diane

AB  - INTRODUCTION There are many compelling reasons to make research open access (OA), but raising the awareness of faculty and administrators about OA is a struggle. Now that more and more funders are introducing OA policies, it is increasingly important that researchers understand OA and how to comply with these policies. U.K. researchers and their institutions have operated within a complex OA policy environment for many years, and academic libraries have been at the forefront of providing services and outreach to support them. This article discusses the results of a qualitative study that investigated effective practices and strategies of OA outreach in the United Kingdom. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 individuals at seven universities in the United Kingdom in late 2015. Transcripts of these interviews were analyzed for dominant themes using an inductive method of coding. RESULTS Themes were collected under the major headings of “The Message”; “Key Contacts and Relationships”; “Qualities of the OA Practitioner”; and “Advocacy versus Compliance.” DISCUSSION Results indicate that messages about OA need to be clear, concise, and jargon free. They need to be delivered repeatedly and creatively adapted to specific audiences. Identifying and building relationships with influencers and informers is key to the uptake of the message, and OA practitioners must have deep expertise to be credible as the messengers. CONCLUSION This timely research has immediate relevance to North American libraries as they contend with pressures to ramp up their own OA outreach and support services to assist researchers in complying with new federal funding policies.

AB  - Researchers from Uzbekistan are leading the global list of publications in predatory journals. The current paper reviews the principles of implementation of the “publish or perish policy” in Uzbekistan with an overarching aim of detecting the factors that are pushing more and more scholars to publish the results of their studies in predatory journals. Scientific publications have historically been a cornerstone in the development of science. For the past five decades, the quantity of publications has become a common indicator for determining academic capacity. Governments and institutions are increasingly employing this indicator as an important criterion for promotion and recruitment; simultaneously, researchers are being awarded Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees for the number of articles they publish in scholarly journals. Many talented academics have had a pay rise or promotion declined due to a short or nonexistent bibliography, which leads to significant pressure on academics to publish. The “publish or perish” principle has become a trend in academia and the key performance indicator for habilitation in Uzbekistan. The present study makes a case for re-examining the criteria set by the Supreme Attestation Commission of the Republic of Uzbekistan for candidates applying for Ph.D. and D.Sc. as well as faculty promotion requirements in the light of current evidence for the deteriorating academic performance of scholars.

AB  - An increasing number of colleges and universities throughout the world are adopting electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) as either an option or a requirement for graduate degrees. This movement has resulted in questions about the role of these electronic documents in the world of scholarly communications and publishing. One specific question raised by students and their faculty advisors has been whether or not ETDs would be viewed as prior publications and would, as such, be ineligible for consideration for publication in traditional journals. This article presents survey findings that indicate that, while more study is needed, this concern appears to be largely unwarranted.

AB  - ABSTRACT The long‐established peer‐review practices in scholarly journals have remained largely unchanged by the introduction of the Internet. Nevertheless, critique of the shortcomings of current practices (bias, slowness, etc.) have led to many publishers and journals experimenting with novel ways of performing and organizing peer review, enabled by e‐publishing and new revenue models. This article proposes a taxonomy of such innovations and discusses a number of cases where, for instance, the assignment of reviewers is handled differently from current best practice. New models, which seem particularly attractive to manuscript authors, are acceptance of any scientifically valid articles as practiced in ‘megajournals‘. and increased transparency about how the peer‐review process in a particular journal works.

VL  - 4
AU  - Morrison, Heather
C1  - Simon Fraser University
AB  - The current state of scholarly communication is presented as one of contest between an increasingly commercial system that is dysfunctional and incompatible with the basic aims of scholarship, and emerging alternatives, particularly open access publishing and open access archiving. Two approaches to facilitating global participation in scholarly communication are contrasted; equity is seen as a superior goal to the donor model, which requires poverty or inequity to succeed. The current state of scholarly communication within the discipline of communication is examined. A relatively healthy percentage of not-for-profit publishers and at least 76 fully open access journals suggest strong potential for emancipating scholarship in communication from commercial imperatives. Specific sites of struggle and actions for scholars, including developing open access journals and self-archiving, are presented.

AB  - Abstract One of the most dramatic changes in global publishing in the last decade has been the emergence of China. China now has more researchers than the United States, outspends the United States and European Union in research and publishes more scientific papers each year than any other nation in the world. The quality of these papers is also increasing, with more appearing in top‐ranked journals and gaining more citations overall. Despite this success, China has gained an unenviable reputation for research misconduct and geopolitical issues threaten its continuation. Given the impact of China's growing presence on editors, publishers and non‐Chinese authors seeking to publish in the same journals, it is important to understand the reasons, directions and outcomes of these changes, their effect on Chinese scholars and local Chinese journals, and where they might be leading. In this review paper I explore the rise of Chinese scholarship, its influence on global publishing and on Chinese scholars, and how the Chinese government is responding to its new role in global academic publishing.

AU  - Souto, Patricia
C1  - Loughborough University
AB  - New and alternative scientific publishing business models is a reality driven mostly by the information and communication technologies, by the movements towards the recovery of control of the scientific communication activities by the academic community, and by the open access approaches. The hybrid business model, mixing open and toll-access is a reality and they will probably co-exist with respective trade-offs. This essay discusses the changes driven by the epublishing and the impacts on the scholarly communication system stakeholders' interrelationships (publishers-researchers, publishers-libraries and publishers-users interrelationships), and the changes on the scientific publishing business models, followed by a discussion of possible evolving business models. Whatever the model which evolves and dominates, a huge cultural change in authors' and institutions publishing practices will be necessary in order to make the open access happen and to consolidate the right business models for the traditional publishers. External changes such as policies, rewarding systems and institutions mandates should also happen in order to sustain the whole changing scenario.

AB  - Science ministers from European Union nations agreed last month to make publicly funded research publications freely available by 2020, a move European Commissioner for Research, Science & Innovation Carlos Moedas called "huge" and "life-changing." The unanimous decision sets a policy goal of "immediate access" to such research, as well as associated data, published by scientists in the EU's 28 member countries. Each country will implement its own publication policy. The open access push was spearheaded by the Netherlands, which is leading the EU for a six-month term that ends June 30. "The results of publicly funded research are currently not accessible to people outside universities," says Sander Dekker, Dutch state secretary for education, culture, and science. "As a result, teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs do not have access to the latest scientific insight that can be relevant to their work. Universities have to take out expensive subscriptions with publishers to gain access

AB  - The Berkeley Research Impact Initiative (BRII) was one of the first campus-based open access (OA) funds to be established in North America and one of the most active, distributing more than $244,000 to support University of California (UC) Berkeley authors. In April 2015, we conducted a qualitative study of 138 individuals who had received BRII funding to survey their opinions about the benefits and funding of open access. Most respondents believe their articles had a greater impact as open access, expect to tap multiple sources to fund open access fees, and support the UC Open Access Policy and its goal of making research public and accessible. Results of the survey and a discussion of their impact on the BRII program follow.

AB  - The proportion of research outputs published in open access journals or made available on other freely-accessible platforms has increased over the past two decades, driven largely by funder mandates, institutional policies, grass-roots advocacy, and changing attitudes in the research community. However, the relative effectiveness of these different interventions has remained largely unexplored. Here we present a robust, transparent and updateable method for analysing how these interventions affect the open access performance of individual institutes. We studied 1,207 institutions from across the world, and found that, in 2017, the top-performing universities published around 80–90% of their research open access. The analysis also showed that publisher-mediated (gold) open access was popular in Latin American and African universities, whereas the growth of open access in Europe and North America has mostly been driven by repositories.

AB  - Criteria for the evaluation of most scholars' work have recently received wider attention due to high-profile cases of scientific misconduct which are perceived to be linked to these criteria. However, in the competition for career advancement and funding opportunities almost all scholars are subjected to the same criteria. Therefore these evaluation criteria act as 'switchmen', determining the tracks along which scholarly work is pushed by the dynamic interplay of interests of both scholars and their institutions. Currently one of the most important criteria is the impact of publications. In this research, the extent to which publish or perish, a long standing evaluation criterion, led to scientific misconduct is examined briefly. After this the strive for high impact publications will be examined, firstly by identifying the period in which this became an important evaluation criterion, secondly by looking at variables contributing to the impact of scholarly papers by means of a non-structured literature study, and lastly by combining these data into a quantitative analysis.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the qualitative and Altmetrics status of 147 journals indexed in the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). This practical-analytical study used qualitative indicators of journals and quantitative Altmetrics. Data was collected from Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports, and Altmetrics Explorer. The results showed that most of the journals this database covers are from European countries, and only one is from Asian countries. More than half of the reviewed journals have a score lower than average regarding Journal Citation Indicator, Eigenfactor Score, and Article influence score. In addition, 63 % of journals cite articles published less than 19 years ago. Nearly 20 % of journals were not on social media. There is a significant relationship between Journal Citation Indicator indices with Citing Half-life, Article influence score with Eigenfactor Score, and between qualitative and Altmetrics indicators. Most of the reviewed journals showed low-quality performance. These journals needed high scientific impact to increase their credibility and quality and remain in the Web of Science database.

AB  - This article uses Google Scholar (GS) as a source of data to analyse Open Access (OA) levels across all countries and fields of research. All articles and reviews with a DOI and published in 2009 or 2014 and covered by the three main citation indexes in the Web of Science (2,269,022 documents) were selected for study. The links to freely available versions of these documents displayed in GS were collected. To differentiate between more reliable (sustainable and legal) forms of access and less reliable ones, the data extracted from GS was combined with information available in DOAJ, CrossRef, OpenDOAR, and ROAR. This allowed us to distinguish the percentage of documents in our sample that are made OA by the publisher (23.1%, including Gold, Hybrid, Delayed, and Bronze OA) from those available as Green OA (17.6%), and those available from other sources (40.6%, mainly due to ResearchGate). The data shows an overall free availability of 54.6%, with important differences at the country and subject category levels. The data extracted from GS yielded very similar results to those found by other studies that analysed similar samples of documents, but employed different methods to find evidence of OA, thus suggesting a relative consistency among methods.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this article, we summarize the cost implications of print and electronic publishing for scientific scholarly journal publishers, libraries, and scientists. In each case, we developed detailed cost models to demonstrate the importance of factors that affect publishing and decisions made by libraries and scientists to determine whether to subscribe to a journal; if so, in print or electronic medium, and, if not, what alternative information sources to use. In all instances, estimates of unit cost are essential for understanding the dynamics of the economic and systemic interdependencies of publishers, libraries, and readers.

AB  - Along with the increasing use of the Internet, scholarly publishing was affected by the rise of 'predatory journals'. Many authors attribute the success of these journals to the open access provided to potential readers. While many authors have attempted to propose criteria for identifying predatory journals, very little research was directed to explaining their success, and underlying strategies. This study uses a biological sciences perspective, based on the five stages of predation, and examines the strategies accordingly. The results indicate that predatory journals use the same strategies as all Internet-based scams in identifying their prey. The largest number of strategies addresses approaching the authors. The recent trends include personalized call for papers, use of fake metrics, hijacking reputed journals, faking location and editorial structure, addressing a broad range of topics and providing fast services (at the expense of quality). In addition to these strategies, publishing fees are often hidden. In summary, the pressure to publish and metrics-based career advancement procedures are the main attractors driving authors to predatory journals, despite the efforts of scientists and Internet-based means of identifying these journals and publicizing their dishonest practices.

AB  - This country case study describes how science policy instruments are designed to shape publication patterns and identifies the changes in researchers' productivity that can be observed over the period 2009–2016 in Poland by analysing data on 452,277 publications submitted to the country's national research evaluation system. Our analysis reveals that policy instruments used in the country's national research evaluation system, academic promotion procedures and competitive grants have increased the number of articles with an impact factor without compromising publication quality, as measured by a bibliometric indicator. Our findings highlight that only clear and stable incentives have influenced researchers' publications. Therefore, patterns in scholarly book publications—for which regulations were not clear and stable—have not been significantly shaped by science policy.

AB  - The word ‘predatory’ has become an obstacle to a serious discussion of publishing practices. Its use has been both overinclusive, encompassing practices that, while undesirable, are not malicious, and underinclusive, missing many exploitative practices outside the open access sphere. The article examines different business models for scholarly publishing and considers the potential for abuse with each model. After looking at the problems of both blacklists and so-called ‘whitelists’, the author suggests that the best path forward would be to create tools to capture the real experience of individual authors as they navigate the publishing process with different publishers.

AB  - Abstract Academic publishers now market their most prestigious journals as commercial brands. This paper investigates this trend in the scholarly publishing market, by analyzing how the successive owners of the journal Nature have capitalized on its reputation to generate additional profits to those already accumulated through university library subscriptions. Two branding strategies of the journal Nature are analyzed: the first one, product line extension, consists in extending the Nature brand in the same product category, by creating an ever‐increasing number of derived Nature journals; the second one, brand extension, consists in extending the Nature brand to other categories of products and services, such as academic rankings, sponsored supplements, feature advertisements, or webinars and trainings. The Nature brand leveraging strategy has been imitated by many other journal publishers. These branded products and services are well suited to the particular dynamics of the scientific field, which is based on the continuous quest for recognition. They are thus sold at all stages of the research cycle, from writing grants to popularizing research results, to scientists and academic institutions competing to accumulate symbolic capital. In this respect, academic publishers that engage in scholarly journal branding contribute to the transformation of the scientific ‘community’ into a scientific market.

Addressing different areas within music therapy and the broader field of musical care (Sanfilippo &amp; Spiro, 2022), the articles encompass a clinical case study of music therapy with a child in Israel (Nir Seri) as well as original research studies regarding music-for-health practices in paediatric hospitals in the UK (Jessica Tomlinson and John Habron), the role of music listening in chronic pain and anxiety management (Marie Strand Skånland), as well as the lived experiences of six music therapists who identify as having hearing loss (Sara Cole and Catherine Warner). The theme of music listening and hearing loss is explored further through an interview with Paul Whittaker; a profoundly deaf musician whose work has been devoted to challenging assumptions regarding how people hear and perceive music, and encouraging other deaf people to engage with music. &#x0D; At the 12th European Music Therapy Conference, Approaches took part in a roundtable discussion regarding the role that open access journals can, and perhaps should, play in decolonising music therapy. In discussion with colleagues from the editorial teams of the Australian Journal of Music Therapy, Qualitative Inquiries in Music Therapy, and Voices: A World Forum for Music Therapy, four key areas were identified: accessibility, language, power and diversity, and culture (Tsiris et al., 2022). Critical engagement with these areas is vital in our endeavours to disturb conventional assumptions around scholarly publishing.&#x0D; In Approaches, our team has worked hard over the past year to expand the scope of what we offer. This work has led to the creation of ‘Approaches PLUS,’ a new space on the journal’s website dedicated to the ongoing development and free dissemination of innovative resources. Building on our commitment to an open access culture, Approaches PLUS seeks to foster new forms of knowledge and knowing, and to reach diverse audiences.&#x0D; Launching this new initiative, the first resource published in Approaches PLUS is an English-Greek music therapy dictionary. Its title, Music Therapy Dictionary: A Place of Interdisciplinary Encounters, reflects the dictionary’s vision to create a co-constructed space where the Greek translation of concepts and terms follows an informed process of documentation, rendering, and interpretation. Co-edited by Mitsi Akoyunoglou, Dimitra Papastavrou, Konstantina Katostari, and myself, the first edition of the dictionary contains over 1000 terms and acronyms, as well as 26 entries focusing in greater detail on specific concepts. Authored by 25 authors, these entries followed a peer-review process prior to publication. This process resonates with our work as a bilingual English-Greek journal seeking to promote the ongoing growth of the music therapy discourse in the Greek language in a culturally responsive and sensitive way.&#x0D; The dictionary is intended to be a living resource which is updated regularly, inviting contributions from different authors. Potential authors can submit proposals for new entries as well as suggestions for alternative renditions and translations of terms which can be included in subsequent editions. The peer review process for all entries fosters a dialectical culture where behind-the-scenes translational dilemmas and debates can have direct implications for the advancement of terminology in music therapy.&#x0D; In the coming months, Approaches PLUS will be enriched with other resources in addition to the dictionary. Common ground for all these resources is our vision for promoting new collaborative and community-led publishing approaches in music therapy where multiple voices and different languages are heard and represented. This ongoing development of Approaches is the fruit of teamwork founded in a social approach to leadership (Stodd, 2014) that is shared, creative, and empathetic (dos Santos, 2022). The recent appointment of Andeline dos Santos as co-editor-in-chief of Approaches feeds directly to the leadership of the journal. Andeline brings to this role a wealth of experience as a practitioner, educator, and researcher, and I very much look forward to working with her as a new chapter of Approaches’ life begins!

AB  - The paper aims to understand the context and drivers of researchers' decision to submit a manuscript to a journal with questionable practices. Using OMICS as a case study and asking authors for their views, the paper presents their profile, motivations and publishing experiences. The methodology is based on a questionnaire sent by e-mail to all authors of articles in journals published by OMICS (+2200). The authors were asked about (a) the factors that influenced their decision to submit their article; (b) their publishing experience with OMICS; (c) their level of satisfaction; and (d) whether or not they would repeat the experience. A total of 86 responses were collected and 18 e-mails were received. The analysis made it possible to add details to the profiles of authors already identified in the literature, but also allowed new and more nuanced profiles. This research extends our knowledge on the phenomenon of predatory publishing from the authors' feedback and provides a better understanding of the socio-economic, psychosocial and geo-political conditions that drive researchers' decisions to submit their work to a possible, potential, or probable predatory journal. At the same time, it reveals some of the strategies used by OMICS to persuade authors to submit their papers. The findings will help to inform institutional policies that seek to put in place efficient measures to combat predatory publishing.

AB  - Faculty hold widely varying perspectives on the benefits and challenges afforded by open access (OA) publishing. In the United States, conversations on OA models and strategy have been dominated by scholars affiliated with Carnegie R1 institutions. This article reports findings from interviews conducted with faculty at a Carnegie R2 institution, highlighting disciplinary and individual perspectives on the high costs and rich rewards afforded by OA. The results reiterate the persistence of a high degree of skepticism regarding the quality of peer review and business models associated with OA publishing. By exploring scholars' perceptions of and experiences with OA publishing and their comfort using or sharing unpublished, publicly available content, the authors highlight the degree to which OA approaches must remain flexible, iterative and multifaceted – no single solution can begin to accommodate the rich and varying needs of individual stakeholders.

AB  - The Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) is a prominent open access (OA) publisher that uses article processing charges (APCs) as its business model. Our objective was to determine the association between the APCs levied by MDPI journals and 1) their inclusion in Scopus and Web of Science databases or 2) their stature, as represented by their CiteScore (Elsevier&amp;rsquo;s Scopus) and Impact Factor (awarded by Clarivate Analytics). Among the 227 journals published by MDPI, 51 had both IF and CiteScore; 107, only a CiteScore; and 84, neither IF nor CiteScore. The charges levied by the journals varied widely, from 0 to CHF 2000 (Swiss francs), the most frequent figure (159 journals) being CHF 1000, or about &amp;euro;930. The amount of APCs was found to be correlated to IF (R&amp;sup2; = 0.64; p &lt;0.001; 107 journals) and also to CiteScore (R&amp;sup2; = 0.619; p &lt;0.001; 53 journals). The charges levied by journals that had both IF and CiteScore were significantly higher than those charged by journals with neither IF nor CiteScore (p &lt;0.05). The charges were also correlated to the age of the journal: the more recently launched journals charged less than the older journals did.

AB  - &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; We present a first estimate of the extent of predatory publishing amongst South African academics. This estimate is based on an analysis of all South African authored papers that qualified for subsidy over the period 2005 to 2014. The analysis shows that 4246 South African papers were published in 48 journals which we re-classified (refining Beall’s classification) as either being probably or possibly predatory. A breakdown of these papers by year shows that the greatest increase in predatory publishing has occurred since 2011. Results are also presented of the distribution of these papers by individual university and scientific field. We conclude with some suggestions about predatory publishing and its pervasive consequence for our trust in science and how this should be addressed by the major stakeholders in the South African higher education system.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Significance: &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; This study is the first to analyse the extent of predatory publishing in South Africa.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;

AB  - Access to scholarship in the health sciences has greatly increased in the last decade. The adoption of the 2008 U.S. National Institutes of Health Public Access Policy and the launch of successful open access journals in health sciences have done much to move the exchange of scholarship beyond the subscription-only model. One might assume, therefore, that scholars publishing in the health sciences would be more supportive of these changes. However, the results of this survey of attitudes on a campus with a large medical faculty show that health science respondents were uncertain of the value of recent changes in the scholarly communication system.

AB  - Abstract This analysis of 229 editorials and opinion pieces published in science and medical journals explores the affective discourses used to characterise so‐called predatory publishing. Most (84%, n = 193) deploy one or more of three related categories of metaphorical and figurative language (fear, fakery and exploitation) to strengthen their rhetorical case. This paper examines the deployment, co‐occurrence and amplification of this language across the science publishing system, focusing particularly on the role of major science journals in adopting and normalising this emotive discourse. The analysis shows how few editorials offer alternative perspectives on these developments (n = 9), and their relative invisibility in scholarly debates.

AB  - In 2005, the Scott Memorial Library at Thomas Jefferson University started an institutional repository (IR), the Jefferson Digital Commons (JDC) <http://jdc.jefferson.edu/>. Originally intended as a showcase for faculty scholarship, it has evolved to serve also as a university press for original journals and newsletters, and as an institutional archive. Many lessons have been learned about marketing techniques, common IR issues, and advantages of an IR for a library. IR recruitment has come to be viewed as yet another form of collection development and has been integrated into all forms of the Library's outreach. Jefferson's academic health sciences environment has proven similar to other academic environments on issues of acceptance and participation.

AB  - Much of the debate on Plan S seems to concentrate on how to make toll-access journals open access, taking for granted that existing open access journals are Plan S-compliant. We suspected this was not so and set out to explore this using Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) metadata. We conclude that a large majority of open access journals are not Plan S-compliant, and that it is small publishers in the humanities and social sciences (HSS) not charging article processing charges (APC) that will face the largest challenge with becoming compliant. Plan S needs to give special considerations to smaller publishers and/or non-APC based journals.

AB  - The open access model, defined here as free access to scholarly publishing, has emerged alongside the traditional, subscription-based model for publishing medical journals [1–3]. The open access model was developed largely in response to rapidly rising subscription prices [4, 5], which raised concerns about access to scientific research, especially that funded by public entities [2]. In 2003, Public Library of Science (PLoS) launched a nonprofit scientific and publishing venture producing open access journals with no charge for access and, other than appropriate citation, no restrictions on use [6]. Funders of biomedical research, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), also pushed for open access to research they support. In 2007, the NIH public access policy was signed into law, requiring that all investigators funded by NIH have an electronic version of their final manuscripts publicly available within twelve months of publication [2].Despite the emergence of open access, knowledge of the finances of medical journal publishers is limited [4]. Published reports have surveyed open access journals, described their business models, and reported their finances [1, 7] but have been limited by their scope or have been disproportionately weighted away from for-profit publishers [1]. This study therefore sought to increase understanding of the finances of the publishers of the most highly cited US general and internal medicine journals by examining the tax status, revenue, expenses, and operating margins in order to inform public debate and policy.

AB  - About half of Library and Information Science (LIS) journals continue to charge authors to publish articles open access (OA) or do not offer OA publishing at all. To further investigate the financial and other perceived barriers preventing these LIS journals from transitioning to no-publishing fee OA models, this exploratory project surveyed lead editors for each identified LIS journal. Results indicate most of the journals have not discussed transitioning to a no-publishing fee OA model, and that finances are the main barrier. Most also indicated a lack of awareness of their journal's budget. The most popular no-publishing fee OA model was Subscribe to Open.

AB  - Economists have done most to innovate scholarly publishing and communication by switching to Open Access. In cultural studies, history, law, political science and sociology, Open Access publishing is still an innovation at the margins. Yet Open Access is demonstrably the superior publishing model in the WWW Galaxy. Research networks, scholarly communities and academic tribes would do well to consider how to switch their communication and publishing to Open Access. The penalty for failing to do this will be decreased visibility and diminished impact, followed ultimately by a decline in public and philanthropic funding. For everyone, this article outlines the compelling reasons to switch to OA. Moreover, we have a common agenda when it comes to the means whereby Open Access is achieved. We will all suffer if a sub-optimal lock-in occurs and innovation spaces are blocked. Therefore, full and partial OA solutions are evaluated. There is also a genuine need for collaboration when it comes to developing the next generation of overlay services such as literature awareness tools, information mining tools and search engines.

AB  - This review critically examines five international scholarly publishers that publish academic journals using the gold (author pays) Open Access model. The author-pays model is changing scholarly publishing because authors, rather than libraries or other subscribers, become the publishers' customers, an arrangement that creates a built in conflict of interest. The more articles a publisher accepts, the more revenue it earns. New gold Open Access publishers are appearing almost weekly, and many are engaged in unethical practices. The review covers four predatory publishers, Academy Publish, BioInfo, ScienceDomain International, and Scientific Research Publishing, and one legitimate publisher, AOSIS Open Journals.

AB  - This study investigates the extent to which open access (OA) publishing models affect French researchers’ attitudes. Research questions were: What place does OA have in attitudes of French researchers in mathematics, biology, and computer science? Are French researchers aware of new publishing models? Do they publish in these new outlets? What funds do they use? What kind of feedback and satisfaction can we observe? We used a quantitative approach to identify structural trends. From April to May 2015, the authors gathered empirical data (interviews, training, and meetings) on researchers’ opinions and understanding of OA publishing models to define the variables and build up the questionnaire that was sent out in June 2015. The findings of the survey demonstrated that, when choosing journals to publish their articles, researchers did not rate OA as a criterion but rather impact, prestige, and symbolic recognition. Publishing OA articles is only in its first stages in the publishing practices of researchers. Lack of policy, prescriptions, and lack of rewards explain why OA is not a factor that determines the publishing strategies of French researchers. The researchers who take the risk of OA publishing are biologists, the older and more experienced researchers, and those who are members of editorial teams.

TI  - From library budget to information budget: fostering transparency in the transformation towards open access
VL  - 35

AB  - The discussion on the transformation of scholarly journals to open access (OA) increasingly concerns financial aspects. Considering the variety of funding strategies for article processing charge (APCs), the array of cost types for scientific information and the need for data monitoring to promote cost transparency, an integrated view of the financial dimension of the OA transition is needed. This commentary describes the need for implementing an information budget that looks beyond just the library budget and comprehensively targets all financial flows from universities and other research performing organizations to publishers. An information budget promotes an integrated perspective on the distributed costs at a given institution. This centralized approach of assessing financial flows can be used to strengthen the position of research institutions when negotiating with publishers.

AB  - Watch VIDEO. Scholarly publishers in small language countries face unique challenges, such as limited funding and resources, lack of visibility and recognition, and the dominance of international commercial publishers in the global academic publishing market. Therefore, understanding the role of publishers in promoting scholarly research in small language countries is crucial. This research aims to evaluate the publication of scholarly journals in a small language country (Lithuania) by analyzing the owners and publishers of scholarly journals. After collecting information about all scholarly journals published in 2020, a list of publishers and owners was compiled. The results show that since 1990, the publishing of Lithuanian scholarly journals has grown significantly: 225 scholarly journals were published in Lithuania, by 73 different publishers, in 2020. Social publishers, mostly state-funded universities, scientific institutes, colleges, still had the largest market share of scholarly periodicals, but commercial publishers also appeared and started to make a business out of publishing scholarly journals. Judging by the number of published articles, the five largest Lithuanian social publishers – state universities – published almost half of all scholarly articles published by Lithuanian publishers. Journals of social science were published the most, and one in five journals published in Lithuania applied relatively small publication fees. The analyzed data on publishers show that Lithuanian publishers have tried to take over and reorganize a number of scholarly journals from the Soviet era, while adapting to the dynamically changing world of scholarly publishing, and moving from simple product-sales models of the 20th century to new digital ecosystems of the 21st century, in which the essential distribution of publications is carried out digitally. The emerging diversity of publishers, the relatively moderate application of publication fees, and the growth in the number of articles show that Lithuanian publishers are quite well prepared for further challenges – the implementation of the European Science Foundation Plan S recommendations.

TI  - From the podium to the boardroom: Encouraging gender parity in scholarly publishing
IS  - 2
VL  - 29
AU  - Kane, Lauren

AB  - As an industry, scholarly publishing attracts more women than men. Yet despite their majority, there is a concerning dearth of women in the industry's most senior positions. Furthermore, and we will posit, contributing to this leadership divide, there is a significant gender gap in speaking opportunities at major industry conferences. In this paper, we will present the research that supports these claims and offer three distinct challenges – to publishing organizations; to the women that work for them; and to the community at large – to help address this imbalance and improve gender parity, both at the podium and in the boardroom. In 2014, preparing for a Society for Scholarly Publishing (SSP) panel entitled ‘Mind the Gap—Addressing the Need for More Women Leaders in Scholarly Publishing’, we analysed the then-current SSP roster of 956 individual members. This list revealed a ratio of 58%/42% women to men. Digital Science's recent demographic survey of 828 individuals across 33 countries corroborated this majority, reporting a ratio of 63%/37% women to men (Wheeler, 2015). This likely does not come as a surprise for anyone who has worked for a major scholarly publisher or attended an industry conference. However, it presents an important baseline for this paper's recommendations: parity based on demographics, not on special treatment. In our 2014 analysis, we examined 68 of SSP's organizational members, finding that at that time, only 24% had a female CEO or equivalent, and just 17% (of a partial list of 54 with data publicly available) had a female chairperson or equivalent. For this paper, we expanded our research to a list of 186 ALPSP organizational members. The ALPSP membership was selected as being representative of a wider swathe of scholarly publishers of different size, revenue, region, and market focus. Note that the list, when accessed in October 2015, included 253 organizational members. For this analysis, we excluded individual consultancies, journals, and those for which leadership data was not publicly available. Of these 186 organizations, 32% had a female CEO, and 21% (of a partial list of 168 with data publicly available) had a female chairperson. These results are summarized in Fig. 1. Even equipped with these compelling data, we have found this disparity to be difficult for many to swallow. In the wake of our ‘Mind the Gap’ session and subsequent discussions, many commenters – male and female – were quick to point out notable examples of female leadership in scholarly publishing. Indeed, we the authors both come from organizations (BioOne and ORCID, respectively) with female CEOs. Yet, until the percentage of women in senior leadership roles rises closer to the percentage of women in the industry, our focus needs to be on the rule rather than the exceptions, as notable and impressive as they may be. As with many industries, scholarly publishing has a rich tradition of annual meetings and conferences, often bringing together professionals from around the globe. Participation in these events is critical for professional development, and the chance to speak – especially as a keynote speaker – is highly desirable. CVs commonly carry a ‘presentations’ section, and job postings for senior positions frequently cite a history of speaking engagements and conference participation as key desiderata. Clearly, in scholarly publishing as in other industries, there is a link between professional progress, especially to the industry's most senior positions, and the visibility and caché afforded by public-speaking opportunities. We analysed seven major scholarly publishing conferences held in 2015, looking at speaker gender as well as keynote assignment and single-gender panels (summarized in Figs. 2 and 3). Conferences included in the analysis were: Academic Publishing in Europe (APE); Professional & Scholarly Publishing (PSP); Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA); Association of Learned Professional and Society Publishers (ALPSP); International Association of Science, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM); Society for Scholarly Publishing (SSP); and Association of American University Presses (AAUP). Of these seven, only one conference fell in line with industry demographics; of AAUP's 142 speakers, 83 were women (58%). SSP also demonstrated a female majority, with 55% women speakers. The other five organizations ranged from 45% down to 17% women speakers, with APE having the lowest percentage. On average, the seven conferences demonstrated a 63% men to 37% women split. Thus, while there is evidence of some diversification efforts, on average, scholarly publishing conferences are under-representing women on their speaker rosters by nearly 20%. Keynote addresses (applied only to those explicitly labelled as such for the purposes of this exercise) represent the largest inequity. Three conferences examined featured only male keynotes, three had keynotes from both men and women, and one had no keynote address. Overall, there were nearly twice as many male to female keynotes (11 by men and six by women out of a pool of 17). Lastly, we examined the prevalent trending hashtag, #allmalepanels, used on social media to highlight panels featuring only male speakers. Our analysis of these seven conferences yielded 15 instances of all-male panels. Interestingly, all but AAUP had at least one all-male panel. Only SSP and AAUP featured the reverse – six and five all-female panels, respectively. If we, as an industry, believe that conference participation is critical to professional development and access to senior leadership positions, then we must create a system that corrects for the significant gender gap in speaking opportunities. Gender disparity does not happen by accident. Mathematician Greg Martin of the University of British Columbia recently made headlines by proving that it was statistically impossible for a speakers’ lineup at a mathematics conference to include only one woman among 20 – even with a conservative 24% female industry representation (Martin, 2015). Extending this to scholarly publishing, with its 58% female majority, we can safely say that a confluence of male keynotes, all-male panels, and overall female-speaking minorities are not accidental results. However, they are likely also not intentional. Instead, they are the result of a system of unacknowledged biases and the tendency to invite individuals to speak who are visible, vocal, and have presented before. In short, gender disparity – and a lack of diversity more generally – is self-perpetuating. I think there is an awareness about ensuring women are represented because so many women work in the scholarly publishing industry. These same women are proposing, organizing, and selecting panelists for sessions. In fact, women have exclusively served as co-chairs for the committee since 2012. In a past year when there was not a woman in the keynote/plenary line-up, our attendees took notice and called it out specifically on the post-event evaluation and via social media. Because we want to be sure we are creating a programme that is appealing to our members and attendees, we take notice and try to be vigilant about ensuring diversity within the programme. In other words, correcting gender disparity – especially during a time of transition – requires forethought and action. SSP's programme committee was committed to gender balance; they sought out (according to their call for proposals,) ‘a variety of viewpoints from a diverse pool of speakers’, and they actively selected sessions and speakers that reflected this diversity. The result was not just a high-quality programme but a speaker lineup that was broadly representative of our industry's demographics. As an industry, scholarly publishing employs more women than men, but fails to reflect this fact among its most senior leaders. A strong, sustainable industry is one that invests in its people and that rewards strong performers irrespective of gender or any other demographic. In closing, we hope that our fellow publishing colleagues will accept our challenges – at the personal, organizational, and industry-wide levels – in order to ensure that scholarly publishing will be able to attract and retain the talented professionals of today and tomorrow. An important note on the authors' methodology: collected data are the result of manual analysis of online conference programs and membership lists and not official or externally validated counts provided by the respective organizations analysed. As such, a small degree of error may be present (e.g., due to misinterpretation of a speaker's gender). However, we believe the margin of error to be minimal and unlikely to significantly affect the results presented.

AB  - Digitization and the rise of Open Access publishing is an important recent development in academic communication. The current publishing system exhibits challenges with cost, where many universities are forced to cancel journal subscriptions for economic reasons, as well as access, as scholars and the public alike often lack access to research published in paywalled subscription journals. Open Access publishing solves the access problem, but not necessarily cost problems. Universities and researchers are currently in a challenging, interstitial stage of scholarly publishing. Subscription journals still dominate scholarly communication, yet a growing imperative to fund and support Open Access alternatives also exists. Stakeholders, including faculty, university administrators, publishers, scientific funding institutions and librarians and governments alike currently strategize and fight for their professional and economic interests in the broader publishing system. Four main trends are suggested that will characterize the future of scholarly publishing: 1) antagonism with scholarly associations; 2) changes and innovations to peer review; 3) Scientific/Intellectual Movements around Open Access 4) publishing and new professional niches in the publishing landscape. This article suggests potential trajectories and outcomes for these various conflicts over the costs and benefits of academic publishing.

AB  - The future of scholarly publishing, in particular the growth of Open Access publishing and how it is financially sustained, is hotly debated. Many different models, advantages, and disadvantages are being discussed. Yet, there is little consensus about what a future system should look like or how it should be governed. To describe the ongoing dynamics in scholarly publishing, this paper introduces the multilevel perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP). This explorative application of the MLP addresses five possible transition pathways: transformation, reconfiguration, substitution, de-alignment &amp; re-alignment, or a sequence. The analysis shows that incumbents survive by adapting to niche innovations and withstanding landscape pressure by innovating themselves, in terms of technology, business models and through acquisitions. In other words, the current trajectory reproduces the oligopoly of incumbents. This means that the sector is, at minimum, on a trajectory of transformation or, potentially, reconfiguration. This diagnosis may change when the dynamics change, for instance if niche innovations and landscape pressure converged stronger on an alternative pathway.

AB  - Peer review of scientific manuscripts before publication is essential in scholarly publishing, and most active researchers hold relationships with a number of journals as both an author and a reviewer. There have been several studies focusing on gender balance in academic research and authorship, but fewer studies on our role as reviewers. Publons is a commercial website run by Clarivate Analytics that allows researchers to track and verify their peer review activities and be recognized for it. The platform features over 2 million researchers and 6.9 million reviews for more than 5,000 partnered journals, listing the most active reviewers as “top reviewers”. Our study focuses on gender representation in this ‘top reviewer’ group while also looking at the countries, regions and research fields they represent, as well as the relationship between their roles as authors and reviewers. The results show that male reviewers dominate in almost all countries, regions, and research fields. Male reviewers generally contribute to review work more frequently than females; however, female reviewers write longer reviews. The correlations between reviewing activity and research activity are generally weak overall and within specific research fields. This may reflect that active reviewers are not necessarily the most productive researchers in their fields. What clearly emerges from our results is the need for more concern over gender representation in the quality assurance and gatekeeping functions of scholarly publishing.

AB  - The loss of talented women from senior academic positions has partly resulted from a lower number of published papers and the accompanying reduced visibility of female compared to male scientists. The reasons for these gender-differences in authorship is unclear. One potential reason is a bias in the editorial and review process of scientific journals. We investigated whether patterns of authorship and editorial outcome were biased according to gender and geographic location in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology. Such potential bias may contribute to inequality in the field. We found patterns of gender differences in authorship, but this was unrelated to the editorial decision of whether to publish the manuscript. Female first-authors (the lead role) were six times less likely to be named as the corresponding author than male first-authors, and female first-authors were more likely to be displaced as corresponding authors by female co-authors than were male first-authors. We found an under-representation of female first- and last-authors compared to baseline populations of members of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (which publishes the Journal of Evolutionary Biology) and of Evolutionary Biology faculty at the world top-10 universities for the Life Sciences. Also, manuscripts from Asia were five times more likely to be rejected on the final decision, independent of gender. Overall our results suggest that the peer review processes we investigated at the Journal of Evolutionary Biology are predominately gender-neutral, but not neutral to geographic location. Editorial gender-bias is thus unlikely to be a contributing factor to differences in authorship in this journal.

AB  - Summary There is a widespread perception in the academic community that peer review is subject to many biases and can be influenced by the identity and biographic features (such as gender) of manuscript authors. We examined how patterns of authorship differ between men and women, and whether author gender influences editorial and peer review outcomes and/or the peer review process for papers submitted to the journal Functional Ecology between 2010 and 2014. Women represented approximately a third of all authors on papers submitted to Functional Ecology . Relative to overall frequency of authorship, women were underrepresented as solo authors (26% were women). On multi‐authored papers, women were also underrepresented as last/senior authors (25% were women) but overrepresented as first authors (43% were women). Women first authors were less likely than men first authors to serve as corresponding and submitting author of their papers; this difference was not influenced by the gender of the last author. Women were more likely to be authors on papers if the last author was female. Papers with female authors (i) were equally likely to be sent for peer review, (ii) obtained equivalent peer review scores and (iii) were equally likely to be accepted for publication, compared to papers with male authors. There was no evidence that male editors or male reviewers treated papers authored by women differently than did female editors and reviewers, and no evidence that more senior editors reached different decisions than younger editors after review, or cumulative through the entire process, for papers authored by men vs. women. Papers authored by women were more likely to be reviewed by women. This is primarily because women were more likely to be invited to review if the authors on a paper were female than if the authors were male. Patterns of authorship, and the role undertaken as author (e.g., submitting and serving as corresponding author), differ notably between men and women for papers submitted to Functional Ecology . However, consistent with a growing body of literature indicating that peer review underlying the scholarly publishing process is largely gender‐neutral, outcomes of editorial and peer review at Functional Ecology were not influenced by author gender.

AB  - The productivity and performance of men is generally rated more highly than that of women in controlled experiments, suggesting conscious or unconscious gender biases in assessment. The degree to which editors and reviewers of scholarly journals exhibit gender biases that influence outcomes of the peer-review process remains uncertain due to substantial variation among studies. We test whether gender predicts the outcomes of editorial and peer review for >23,000 research manuscripts submitted to six journals in ecology and evolution from 2010 to 2015. Papers with female and male first authors were equally likely to be sent for peer review. However, papers with female first authors obtained, on average, slightly worse peer-review scores and were more likely to be rejected after peer review, though the difference varied among journals. These gender differences appear to be partly due to differences in authorial roles. Papers for the which the first author deferred corresponding authorship to a coauthor (which women do more often than men) obtained significantly worse peer-review scores and were less likely to get positive editorial decisions. Gender differences in corresponding authorship explained some of the gender differences in peer-review scores and positive editorial decisions. In contrast to these observations on submitted manuscripts, gender differences in peer-review outcomes were observed in a survey of >12,000 published manuscripts; women reported similar rates of rejection (from a prior journal) before eventual publication. After publication, papers with female authors were cited less often than those with male authors, though the differences are very small (~2%). Our data do not allow us to test hypotheses about mechanisms underlying the gender discrepancies we observed, but strongly support the conclusion that papers authored by women have lower acceptance rates and are less well cited than are papers authored by men in ecology.

AB  - Abstract Despite substantial progress for women in science, women remain underrepresented in many aspects of the scholarly publication process. We examined how the gender diversity of editors and reviewers changed over time for six journals in ecology and evolution (2003–2015 for four journals, 2007–2015 or 2009–2015 for the other two), and how several aspects of the peer review process differed between female and male editors and reviewers. We found that for five of the six journals, women were either absent or very poorly represented as handling editors at the beginning of our dataset. The representation of women increased gradually and consistently, with women making up 29% of the handling editors (averaged across journals) in 2015, similar to the representation of women as last authors on ecology papers (23% in 2015) but lower than the proportion of women among all authors (31%) and among members of the societies that own the journals (37%–40%). The proportion of women among reviewers has also gradually but consistently increased over time, reaching 27% by 2015. Female editors invited more female reviewers than did male editors, and this difference increased with age of the editor. Men and women who were invited to review did not differ in whether they responded to the review invitation, but, of those that responded, women were slightly more likely to agree to review. In contrast, women were less likely than men to accept invitations to serve on journal editorial boards. Our analyses indicate that there has been progress in the representation of women as reviewers and editors in ecology and evolutionary biology, but women are still underrepresented among the gatekeepers of scholarly publishing relative to their representation among researchers.

AB  - Ghost authorship, whereby someone who has made a major contribution to a scientific article as an author is not acknowledged, is a widespread practice, says a study published this week. In the clinical trials investigated in the study, three quarters of individuals who had made significant contributions to the final paper were not listed as authors ( PLoS Medicine 2007;4:e19). In most cases these were statisticians working for the company sponsoring the trial. “Ghost authorship is a form of research misappropriation, and we believe that this practice serves commercial purposes,” said the study's lead author, Peter Gotzsche, of the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen. “Authorship establishes accountability, responsibility, …

AB  - This study aims to investigate the attitudes and actions of scientific journal editors in China towards open access. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 Chinese editors from various scientific journals during September and October of 2022. The results indicate that the editors generally possess knowledge of open access and have implemented an appropriate open access model for their respective journals. However, the Chinese-language journal editors expressed a lack of motivation to adopt open access, unless there is a reform in the mechanism of academic publishing or a policy is imposed. On the other hand, the English-language journal editors acknowledged that they have no other choice but to adopt open access. This study helps us learn about Chinese editors’ understanding and attitudes towards open access, the current status of open access in China’s scientific journals, and the mechanisms of academic publishing in China.

Learn more.Copy URL Share a linkShare onFacebookTwitterLinkedInRedditWechat Abstract Key points The debate about open access has until now focused on the gold (journals) versus the green route (manuscript self-archival). Recently an even more disruptive form of OA has emerged, in the form of illegal article copies retrievable from academic social networks or pirate sites. Illegal, or “black open access”, provides access to a large part of the pay-walled article output which cannot be found in repositories. INTRODUCTION Universal open access (OA) to scholarly research publications is deceptively simple as a concept. Any scientific publications, whether found via a Google keyword search, or by trying to access a citation would be just one click away. But the path to get there from the current subscription-dominated journal publishing model has proved to be complex and filled with obstacles. Since the terms gold and green OA were coined almost 15 years ago, much of the debate inside the OA movement has been focused on the relative merits of these two paths (Harnad et al., 2004). Currently gold OA seems to be growing in importance. There are a number of factors contributing to this. First is the emergence of successful professional OA publishers and megajournals offering rapid publication via an innovative peer review approach. The second coming from hybrid OA publication, is also of increasing impact, fuelled by the new APC funding mechanisms put in place by major research funders like the Wellcome Trust and the Research Councils UK. New kinds of nationwide super-bundle licences that cover both subscription access and hybrid charges, could further establish hybrid as a conversion vehicle to full OA (Björk, 2016). Traditional green OA in institutional repositories has been struggling with getting researchers to upload, despite the fact that most major universities now have such repositories in place (Eisen, 2015). The researchers just do not seem to bother with the little extra work involved and many are ignorant of the possibilities. The leading subject repositories, arXiv and PMC are doing better, but only cover some fields of science. And publishers have tightened embargo rules for self-archiving, making green OA less attractive. All in all, the progress towards full OA has been slower than hoped for. Currently somewhere between 35 and 50% of all research articles from recent years can be found as either gold, hybrid, or self-archived repository copies. Empirical studies have shown varying shares depending on the definitions and methods employed (Archambault et al., 2013; Björk, Laakso, Welling, & Paetau, 2014; Research Information Network, 2015). A recent development muddling the picture is the emergence of other channels for uploading and accessing research articles without subscriptions, payments, and bureaucracy. In contrast to proper repositories which by and large enforce the licence rules, these new channels mostly offer the exact digital replicas of the published journal articles, and do so illegally. The two main players are academic social media, especially Research Gate, and pirate copy websites such as Sci-Hub. I propose to call this black OA. Black as in the classical pirate flag, or in black market! I was first considering the milder colour grey, but the term grey literature has already an established meaning in the context of scholarly publishing covering theses, government reports, and the rest (Schöpfel, 2011). Grey literature has in fact greatly benefitted from OA. Other terms which have been suggested are ‘rogue’ OA or ‘Robin Hood’ OA (Archambault, 2014), but my preference is for a simple tricolour scheme. In terms of colour coding of flavours of OA the term platinum OA (Haschak, 2007) has also been proposed for non-APC-charging gold OA (free also for authors), but the term has never really caught on. ACADEMIC SOCIAL NETWORKS Academic Social Networks (ASNs, i.e. Research Gate, Mendeley, Academia.edu) have their origin in the tremendous success of networks like Facebook and LinkedIn. Like all such networks, the key factor is critical mass. If enough colleagues of yours have already joined, the incentive increases. Some ASNs also have a dubious practice of spamming non-members with emails seemingly coming from colleagues, which actually are sent automatically by the systems. ASNs also try to offer other features like citation counts of their own, user profiles, and so on (Nicholas, Clark, & Herman, 2016). The leading ASNs are all business ventures where the revenue model, because they do not charge members, is to build up a big enough user base to exit via being bought by a bigger company (Matthews, 2016). The prime case is Mendeley, which was purchased by Elsevier in 2013. Elsevier also bought the much older SSRN (Social Sciences Research Network) in 2016. Although most articles uploaded to ASNs are direct portable document format (PDF) copies of the published articles, it is perfectly possible to upload personal versions of the manuscripts. But even this might not be in accordance with many licence agreements that authors have signed with publishers. So far massive lawsuits against ASNs have not started, but for instance Elsevier has sent out takedown requests to Academia.edu (Howard, 2013). PIRATE COPY SITES The role model for sites of pirate copies of scholarly journal articles is Napster. Here the driving force is not financial gain but indignation that a few big publishers are making big profits ‘off the back’ of the global academic community. The notion that the results of research is a public good which should be free is common with advocates of gold and green OA, but the approach is more radical in actually breaking the law. To date Sci-Hub is the notable example, although there have been earlier incidents of massive downloading of scholarly articles by OA activists (Murphy, 2011). Another related way of obtaining article copies is to twitter messages including an article title (i.e. #icanhazPDF) asking unknown academics who have subscription access to download a copy and mail it to the tweeter (Gardner & Gardner, 2015). As blatantly illegal as Sci-Hub for instance is, it has been difficult for the publishers to take legal action. What they have achieved so far is that Sci-Hub has been forced to cede some domain names, but the service has so far managed to quickly resurface using slightly altered ones (Kravets, 2016). As for approaches like #icanhazPDF, although the actions are in principle illegal, it would be extremely difficult to take legal action. WHY HAS BLACK OA BECOME SO POPULAR Black OA has grown very rapidly in the last 3–4 years. The reasons are slightly different for the two subspecies. Authors who have joined ASNs probably find it easy to just post the exact published PDF of their article there, no questions asked. The alternative, using their institutional repository, would entail first finding out the exact meaning of the complex copyright and licence agreements they sign with the publisher. After that there would often be the extra work of formatting the manuscript, inserting a title page, and reformatting for instance tables and figures which often have been separate files before submission. From the reader's viewpoint ASN copies are as easily findable as other types of green OA. In a Google scholar search a free Research Gate copy will show up in a column to the right, the same way an institutional or subject repository one will. A basic Google search will primarily point to the publisher's version, usually behind a pay wall. But simply adding ‘Research Gate’ to the title in the search string will take you to the copy, if there is one. As for Sci-Hub it is a pure pirate site, which has not asked for consent from authors or publishers. The repository has downloaded more than 50 million journal articles directly from the publishers’ websites (Bohannon, 2016). This has been accomplished using the passwords of individual researchers to their university library portals for mass downloading, but it is unclear if the passwords have been voluntarily given by the individuals in question, or whether they have been obtained by phishing. Slightly cumbersome for readers is that Sci-Hub copies do not show up in Google or Google Scholar searches. The user has to go to the site itself (which is constantly changing name, due to lawsuits from the big publishers) and input the digital object identifier (DOI) or the title of the article he searches for. In case it cannot be found this actually triggers Sci-Hub software to go and find and retrieve it. Hence the site is used more as a last resort when a free copy cannot be found otherwise. It is definitely quicker than mailing authors in the hope of obtaining a copy, not to mention the archaic and slow method of interlibrary loan, if that is even a possibility. And for many younger academics and students paying pay-per-view charges is out of the question. The strength of Sci-Hub is currently that it is much more comprehensive than ASNs or repositories which only contain selected articles rather randomly. And many of the users of Sci-Hub, despite this, say they use it more for convenience than to save cost (Charleston Conference, 2016). In summary, for both ASNs and pirate sites there are three major reasons why they have become so popular with both authors and readers. Ease of use, the fact that they are found morally acceptable by most academics (Travis, 2016) and the almost non-existent legal risks involved in up- and downloading individual articles. CONCLUSIONS In a nutshell, around 25% of recent research articles (after a year) are accessible as gold OA, and an additional 15–20% can be found as legal green copies. Of the remaining 50% the vast majority are findable as illegal black OA copies. The direct negative effects of black OA on mainstream subscription publishing, in terms of decreasing revenue, have so far probably been negligible. A major reason is that most of the sales revenue is in the form of huge electronic big deals, which usually span several years. Also the publishers exert huge lock-in power, so that it is almost impossible for a library to refuse a deal with one of the major publishers. There is thus a lot of inertia in the system, isolating it from negative impacts of both green and black OA. The loss of income could potentially be bigger in less-developed countries with strained university budgets, but publishers get much less income from those anyway and in many cases offer free access. The biggest effect of black OA could in fact be in diluting the popularity of green OA channels, in combination with publishers tightening the embargo rules, which in institutional repositories tend to follow. If anything, black OA should be seen as a symptom of a seriously flawed mainstream scholarly publishing model, which has failed to adequately adapt to the needs of the international research community. Black OA is obviously not a solution to the problems, the remedy is (in my opinion) 100% gold OA for research papers funded by APCs or other mechanisms. If and when we get there the ‘market demand’ for retrieval via sites like Research Gate and Sci-Hub will disappear, and the use of subject and institutional repositories will be reduced to preprint manuscripts, grey literature, and overlay purposes. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS On a personal note I have a wide-ranging experience of the channels discussed in this article. I have published in both free and APC-charging OA journals, in a delayed OA journal, and some articles of mine in subscription journals are hybrid OA. I have uploaded many manuscript copies to my university's institutional repository, to a personal website shared with a colleague, and some of my articles can be found in PMC. Co-authors have uploaded articles to Research Gate, and the one subscription journal article I specifically checked via Sci-Hub was indeed retrievable. REFERENCES Archambault, E. (2014).

AB  - Open access publishing (OAP) makes research output freely available, and several national governments have now made OAP mandatory for all publicly funded research. Gold OAP is a common form of OAP where the author pays an article processing charge (APC) to make the article freely available to readers. However, gold OAP is a cause for concern because it drives a redistribution of valuable research money to support open access papers in ‘mega-journals’ with more permissive acceptance criteria. We present a data-driven evaluation of the financial ramifications of gold OAP and provide evidence that gold OAP in mega-journals is biased toward Western industrialized countries. From 2011 to 2015, the period of our data collection, countries with developing economies had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in the lower-tier mega-journals and thus paid article APCs that cross-subsidize publications in the top-tier journals of the same publisher. Conversely, scientists from Western developed countries had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in those same top-tier journals. The global inequity of the cross-subsidizing APC model was demonstrated across five different mega-journals, showing that the issue is a common problem. We need to develop stringent and fair criteria that address the global financial implications of OAP, as publication fees should reflect the real cost of publishing and be transparent for authors.

AB  - Abstract The study examined the research impact of gold open access (OA) journals in engineering and technology. A total of 37 gold route journals that request article processing charges (APC) and 66 other OA journals without APC in the field were found in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and used for the study. The publishers, APC charges and the year each journal was added to DOAJ were identified and included in this study An informetric approach was used to extract research impact indicators (citations, paper productivity, cite/paper, cite/journal and h-index) of journals. Findings revealed that the publishers of the APC journals were dominated by commercial publishing companies producing over 60% of the journals. Article processing charges ranged from 7.6 USD to 3471.5 USD while the average article processing charges for APC journals was 727 USD. Gold route open access (APC) journals performed better than open access non-APC OA journals since they produced 51.2% of the papers, 71.8% of the total citations and 65.1% of the total h-index. However, findings showed a weak positive correlation between articles processing charges (APC) of the gold route journals and their research impact; while there is high significant positive correlation between research impact of gold route (APC journals) and non-APC open access journals.

AB  - Google Scholar has become an important player in the scholarly economy.Whereas typical academic publishers sell bibliometrics, analytics and ranking products, Alphabet, through Google Scholar, provides "free" tools for academic search and scholarly evaluation that have made it central to academic practice.Leveraging political imperatives for open access publishing, Google Scholar has managed to intermediate data flows between researchers, research managers and repositories, and built its system of citation counting into a unit of value that coordinates the scholarly economy.At the same time, Google Scholar's user-friendly but opaque tools undermine certain academic norms, especially around academic autonomy and the academy's capacity to understand how it evaluates itself.

AB  - The degree to which scholarly journal articles published in subscription-based journals could be provided open access (OA) through publisher-permitted uploading to freely accessible web locations, so called green OA, is an underexplored area of research. This study combines article volume data originating from the Scopus bibliographic database with manually coded publisher policies of the 100 largest journal publishers measured by article output volume for the year 2010. Of the 1.1 million articles included in the analysis, 80.4 % could be uploaded either as an accepted manuscript or publisher version to an institutional or subject repository after one year of publication. Publishers were found to be substantially more permissive with allowing accepted manuscripts on personal webpages (78.1 % of articles) or in institutional repositories (79.9 %) compared to subject repositories (32.8 %). With previous studies suggesting realized green OA to be around 12 % of total annual articles the results highlight the substantial unused potential for green OA.

AB  - The Working Group on Expanding Access to Published Research Findings reported to the UK's Minister of Universities and Science in mid-2012. This was followed by a new policy for open access (OA) publishing by Research Councils UK (RCUK) as well as a commitment from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to require that research submitted to future research evaluation exercises – after the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) – be open access. These initiatives build on a broad consensus, that includes for-profit publishers, that open access is the way of the future. Here, I give a perspective on these issues, both as the head of an institution with particular interests in the future of scholarly publication and also as a member of the Working Group on Expanding Access. The continuing development of informed debate will be critical for the future of the scholarly publishing system.

AB  - This paper reports on a study — overseen by representatives of the publishing, library and research funder communities in the UK — investigating the drivers, costs and benefits of potential ways to increase access to scholarly journals. It identifies five different but realistic scenarios for moving towards that end over the next five years, including gold and green open access, moves towards national licensing, publisher-led delayed open access, and transactional models. It then compares and evaluates the benefits as well as the costs and risks for the UK. The scenarios, the comparisons between them, and the modelling on which they are based, amount to a benefit-cost analysis to help in appraising policy options over the next five years. Our conclusion is that policymakers who are seeking to promote increases in access should encourage the use of existing subject and institutional repositories, but avoid pushing for reductions in embargo periods, which might put at risk the sustainability of the underlying scholarly publishing system. They should also promote and facilitate a transition to gold open access, while seeking to ensure that the average level of charges for publication does not exceed circa £2,000; that the rate in the UK of open access publication is broadly in step with the rate in the rest of the world; and that total payments to journal publishers from UK universities and their funders do not rise as a consequence.

AB  - Portable peer review (PPR) refers to peer review that is not conducted by a journal but instead by externally recruited peers whose reports are then made available to that journal's editors.In theory, this would alleviate a journal editor's responsibilities and potentially benefit authors by shortening the time to a decision.While the upside to this model is self-evident, PPR suffers from potential biases since knowledge by the reviewer that they will be paid may skew the outcome of peer review.In one form of PPR, cascade peer review (CPR), a rejected paper is passed down, or cascaded, often to a lower-tier journal within the same publisher's journal fleet, usually accompanied by the rejected journal's reviewer reports.CPR might be perceived as unfair to other authors who have passed a more standard route of rejection and resubmission to the same journal.For these reasons, papers that used either external PPR, or internal CPR, should transparently indicate this fact in both HTML and PDF versions of the paper so that an impression is not created that the authors, journal and publisher are concealing an important part of that paper's publication history.Three experimental paid PPR services (Rubriq, Axios Review, and Peerage of Science) that have now ceased to exist are examined in detail to appreciate their potential weaknesses, allowing academics to learn possible pitfalls in PPR and CPR models.Three reasons might explain their failure and/or lack of adoption: 1) opacity of the use and acknowledgement of such services, thus being a potential ethical infraction; 2) the creation of a two-tier system that favors only well-funded authors who are able to pay for such an exclusive service; 3) risk of peer review bias.

AB  - A controversial policy requiring researchers to make their papers freely available to the public at a U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Web site is facing a potential roadblock. Last week, members of a powerful House committee held the first-ever congressional hearing on the policy and floated a proposal to overturn it.

AB  - The topic of predatory publishing and ways to combat it is garnering considerable attention in many parts of the developed world, where academic librarians are emerging as leaders in this regard. However, less is known about how this phenomenon is playing out in developing regions, including Spanish-speaking Latin America. This study presents the results of a survey of 104 academic librarians in this region, along with follow-up interviews with seven respondents. The findings reveal that scholarly publishing literacy in general, and predatory publishing in particular, currently has low visibility in this part of the world, although there is growing recognition of and increasing concern about the issue. Although there is some debate about whether scholarly publishing literacy should be the sole responsibility of the library, many participants agree that the library has a role to play. Moreover, while most of the librarians who participated perceive that they have a solid knowledge of open access, they are less confident in their understanding of predatory practices and are seeking to increase their skills and knowledge in this regard to better support researchers at their institutions. To address this shortcoming, academic librarians in the region have expressed an interest in receiving training and in participating in international collaborations with other libraries that have already developed resources or programming in this area.

The data were gathered by means of an online questionnaire survey, which obtained 263 Chinese ECRs’ responses. The main conclusions are: (a) journal-based indicators (e.g. journal reputation, Journal Impact Factor, Science Citation Index, etc.) are crucial when Chinese ECRs read and publish; (b) assessment policy plays a vital role when Chinese ECRs decide where to publish; (c) open access and open data have been widely recognized and warmly welcomed by Chinese ECRs, however, they will only publish in open access journals and open their research data if they get rewarded by the evaluation system; (d) most Chinese ECRs had good experience of peer review and they are in favor of double blind peer review; (e) Chinese ECRs are heavy users of social media, they are sophisticated in finding scholarly information online and communicating with peers and colleagues with social media tools.

AB  - Questionable journals represent an increasing problem in scholarly communication. The warnings about such journals are plentiful, but the methods used to identify them vary a great deal and make it difficult to accurately determine which journals are fraudulent or simply of low quality. This article presents an overview of the existing frameworks for identifying questionable journals and discussions around them. Most of the frameworks rely on describing the journals under investigation according to a set of criteria, and some can even be turned into a metric or mechanism. The development of frameworks for identifying questionable journals has so far been characterized by a great diversity in format, length, and content. Generally, the frameworks come with little information on development, validation, and reliability. The consequences of prolific tool development are discussed, and a recommendation for testing such frameworks is proposed.

AB  - This article addresses some of the issues arising from the continuing research and debate on open access (OA) publishing, primarily from the perspective of an academic in the field of humanities. As an academic, the author feels it is essential that scholars embrace the responsibility of being part of the process that reconsiders how to publish their research, and that they recognize they have a key role to play amongst a variety of stakeholders. The launch of the Open Library of Humanities (OLH) in early 2013 and its growing momentum as a scholarly-led movement over the last 12 months demonstrates that there is an increasing awareness amongst the academic community in the humanities of what is required to build a new kind of publishing model. Aspects of this 'do-it-yourself' culture are considered along with various funding options, concluding with a look at international challenges facing the transformation towards open access and where the OLH fits into the picture.

AB  - The number of manuscripts submitted to most scholarly journals has increased tremendously over the last few decades and shows no sign of leveling off. Water, Air and Soil Pollution is no exception in this respect. In 1980, WASP published 89 articles, for a total of 1,008 pages. By 1990, the number of published articles had risen to 259, occupying 2,700 pages. That amounted to a roughly 200% increase in 10 years! In 2009, the journal published 297 articles, occupying 3,601 pages. In other words, in the last 30 years, the page count of WASP has increased by 260%. And still, this volume of published scholarship, in effect, is only the tip of the iceberg. Many more articles are submitted than are published. In recent years, probably thanks in part to the steadily rising impact factor of the journal (from 1.058 in 2004 to 1.398 in 2009), the total number of manuscripts submitted to WASP has sky rocketed. In 2009, the journal received a total of 1,204 manuscripts. Again, this situation is not unique. Many other journals report similar trends (e.g., Baveye et al. 2009; Baveye 2010). If the recent past, with the enormous increase in scholarly production in countries like China and India, is any indication of what lies ahead, a publishing “tsunami” is looming, for which we are hardly prepared at all (Baveye 2010). This frenzy to publish, manifested across the board, is making it more and more difficult for editors and associate editors of scientific journals to secure peer reviews in a timely fashion for the manuscripts they handle (e.g., Baveye et al. 2009; Martin et al. 2009). We hear from fellow editors that it is becoming less and less uncommon to have to issue 10 to 15 invitations before one can secure the peer reviews needed to assess a given manuscript. Even though WASP fares generally better than this, it is certainly true that a high proportion of review invitations are declined. Most often, researchers declining invitations to review invoke the fact that they are too busy to add yet another item to their already overcommitted schedule. Yet, however one looks at it, peer reviewing in any of its different flavors (e.g., open, single, or double-blind) is a crucial component of the publishing process. Nobody has yet come up with a viable alternative. Therefore, we need to find a way to convince our colleagues to peer review manuscripts more often. This can be done with a stick or with Water Air Soil Pollut DOI 10.1007/s11270-010-0355-7

C1  - NOASP, Cappelen Damm Akademisk
AB  - One of the objectives of the open access movement has been to upend the traditional model for scholarly publishing by making research findings freely available to anyone, anywhere. The trend emerged partly in response to the major publishing houses having become the gatekeepers of the dissemination of research findings and setting high prices for access to this material via subscriptions to scholarly journals.On the face of it, this state of affairs suggests that commercial actors have no place in the realm of open access publishing. However, an argument can be made to the effect that commercial companies have a part to play in transforming the way scientific publication works and contribute to making research freely available. Having numerous interested parties in the OA domain may contribute towards making research accessible, leading to a general increase in innovation. This is necessary in a field that by and large is in its infancy, technologically, politically and economically. An OA initiative that is part of a profit-driven organization does not preclude it from contributing to a sustainable publishing model, and a commercial approach is not necessarily incompatible with the principles. In this poster we offer NOASP as an example, and part of the wider context of commercial open access publishing. Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing is an open access publisher of scholarly journals and books in Scandinavia and a subdivision of Cappelen Damm Akademisk. NOASP was established in 2015 – and continues to grow. In our experience, meeting the very specific criteria for Open Access publishing requires substantial investments in technology and human resources. Publishers who choose to establish themselves in this niche area must have a long-term strategy and develop specific expertise. Competition between publishing houses and other actors provides incentives for staying abreast of new requirements and standards, technology and infrastructure. These strategic and economic factors directly and positively impact the quality of journals and publishing solutions, and ultimately contribute to innovation in the field. The economics of commercial publishing, by heightening competition between the services publishers provide, therefore leads to improvement of both technical platforms and editorial practices. In turn, this leads to higher quality of the end product and broader distribution of the freely available research, which should ultimately be the goal of the OA movement.

AB  - Professors and associate professors (“professors”) in full-time positions are key personnel in the scientific activity of university departments, both in conducting their own research and in their roles as project leaders and mentors to younger researchers. Typically, this group of personnel also contributes significantly to the publication output of the departments, although there are also major contributions by other staff (e.g. PhD-students, postdocs, guest researchers, students and retired personnel). The scientific productivity is however, very skewed at the level of individuals, also for professors, where a small fraction of the professors, typically account for a large share of the publications. In this study, we investigate how the productivity profile of a department (i.e. the level of symmetrical/asymmetrical productivity among professors) influences on the citation impact of their departments. The main focus is on contributions made by the most productive professors. The findings imply that the impact of the most productive professors differs by scientific field and the degree of productivity skewness of their departments. Nevertheless, the overall impact of the most productive professors on their departments’ citation impact is modest.

AB  - Peer-review is an essential activity for the vast majority of credited scientific journals and represents the cornerstone for assessing the quality of potential publications, since it is substantially aimed to identify drawbacks or inaccuracies that may flaw the outcome or the presentation of scientific research. Since the importance of this activity is seldom underestimated by some referees, the purpose of this article is to present a personal and arbitrary perspective on how a scientific article should be peer-reviewed, offering a tentative checklist aimed to describe the most important criteria that should be considered. These basically include accepting the assignment only when the topic is in accordance with referee's background, disclosing potential conflicts of interest, checking availability and time according to size and complexity of the article, identifying the innovative value of the manuscript, providing exhaustive and clear comments, expressing disagreement with a fair and balanced approach, weighting revisions according to the importance of the journal, summarizing recommendations according to previous comments, maintaining confidentiality throughout and after the peer-review process. I really hope that some notions reported in this dissertation may be a guide or a help, especially for young scientists, who are willing to be engaged in peer-review activity for scientific journals.

AB  - This study explores early career researchers’ (ECRs) appreciation and utilisation of open access (OA) publishing. The evidence reported here results from a questionnaire-based international survey with 1600 participants, which forms the second leg and final year of a four year long, mixed methods, longitudinal study that sought to discover whether ECRs will be the harbingers of change when it comes to scholarly communications. Proceeding from the notion that today’s neophyte researchers, believed to hold millennial values of openness to change, transparency and sharing, may be best placed to power the take-up of OA publishing, the study sought to discover: the extent to which ECRs publish OA papers; the main reasons for their doing or not doing so; and what were thought to be the broader advantages and disadvantages of OA publishing. The survey data is presented against a backdrop of the literature-based evidence on the subject, with the interview stage data providing contextualisation and qualitative depth. The findings show that the majority of ECRs published in OA journals and this varied by discipline and country. Most importantly, there were more advantages and fewer disadvantages to OA publishing, which may be indicative of problems to do with cost and availability, rather than reputational factors. Among the many reasons cited for publishing OA the most important one is societal, although OA is seen as especially benefiting ECRs in career progression. Cost is plainly considered the main downside.

AB  - Peer review provides the foundation for the scholarly publishing system. The conventional peer review system consists of using authors of articles as reviewers for other colleagues' manuscripts in a collaborative-basis system. However, authors complain about a theoretical overwhelming number of invitations to peer review. It seems that authors feel that they are invited to review many more manuscripts than they should when taking into account their participation in the scholarly publishing system. The high number of scientific journals and the existence of predatory journals were reported as potential causes of this excessive number of reviews required. In this editorial, we demonstrate that the number of reviewers required to publish a given number of articles depends exclusively on the journals' rejection rate and the number of reviewers intended per manuscript. Several initiatives to overcome the peer review crises are suggested.

AB  - The study investigates Library and Information Science (LIS) journals that published research articles between 2003 and 2013, which were about open access (OA) and were indexed in LIS databases. The purpose was to investigate the journals’ OA policies, ascertain the degree to which these policies facilitate OA to publications, and investigate whether such texts are also available as OA. The results show that literature growth in the domain has been significant, with a total of 1,402 articles produced during the eleven years under study. The OA policies of the fifty-six journals that published the highest number of articles were analysed. The results show that most articles (404; 41%) were published in hybrid journals, whereas 272 (29.7%) appeared in OA journals. Some 143 (53%) of the articles published in hybrid journals were available as green OA copies. In total, 602 (66%) of all the articles published were available as OA. The results show that the adoption of OA for research articles on that very subject is somewhat higher than in other fields. The study calls on LIS professionals to be conversant with the OA policies of the various journals that may publish their research.

AB  - Open access, open data, open source and other open scholarship practices are growing in popularity and necessity. However, widespread adoption of these practices has not yet been achieved. One reason is that researchers are uncertain about how sharing their work will affect their careers. We review literature demonstrating that open research is associated with increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities. These findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices.

VL  - 2

AB  - The article discusses the issue of predatory publishers and journals, which exploit academia's "publish or perish" culture by offering quick publication without proper peer review, editorial oversight, or quality control in exchange for hefty publishing fees.To address the issue, many researchers and publishing professionals rely on anonymously managed lists of predatory journals and publishers to identify and avoid disreputable publishing outlets.However, the reliability of such lists is questionable and their criteria for determining what constitutes a predatory journal or publisher may not be transparent or objective.Anonymous list creators may have their own agendas or personal biases that influence their decisions, leading to the inclusion of legitimate publishers or the exclusion of predatory ones.Additionally, such lists may perpetuate systemic bias and include journals with limited resources that are legitimate.Therefore, it is important to use these lists in conjunction with other sources of information, such as official blacklists maintained by reputable organizations or publisher directories that provide transparent information about the publishing process and policies.Ultimately, researchers and scholars must exercise due diligence when selecting publishers and journals to safeguard the credibility of the scientific community.

AB  - Many librarians support faculty with the publishing process, which includes journal selection and evaluating the impact of their scholarly output. While large universities have the resources for entire departments devoted to bibliometrics, the authors of this article give strategies for faculty publishing support at a smaller liberal arts university. The authors created a LibGuide with publishing resources and presented the initiative to several academic divisions. Faculty were surveyed, and the results indicated that the majority of respondents were interested in assessing journal quality and viewed the library as a resource for help with the publishing process.

TI  - How society publishers practice open science beyond open access publishing?
AU  - Pölönen, Janne
AU  - Late, Elina
C1  - Federation of Finnish Learned societies
AB  - Scholarly publishing has rapidly moved towards open access (OA) over the last few decades. However, OA publishing is only one part of a larger open science movement. The recent UNESCO recommendation for open science (UNESCO, 2021) defines open science broadly to cover the openness of scientific knowledge, science infrastructures, engagement with societal actors, and dialogue with other knowledge systems. In its recommendations, open scientific knowledge includes OA to scientific publications but also open research data, metadata, open educational resources, software, and source code and hardware. Earlier research about open scientific knowledge from the point of view of academic publishers has mainly been focused on one element such as OA publishing and neglected other elements.This paper aims to fill this gap by surveying how society publishers in Finland adopted other elements of open scientific knowledge. In Finland, learned societies account for 70% of national journal output (Late et al., 2020) and their publishing model is mainly diamond open access, which excludes author processing charges and relies on publishing subsidies (Pölönen et al., 2020). Furthermore, their activities often go beyond scholarly publishing to include education and research activities such as funding research and collecting and storing research data (Korkeamäki et al., 2019).We conducted an electronic survey addressed to Finnish learned societies in November 2021 to answer the following research questions: “To what degree society publishers take up the elements of open scientific knowledge including open access to publications, open data, and open education?” (RQ1) and “Are elements of open scientific knowledge cumulative?” (RQ2)In total 97 society publishers responded (40% response rate). We analysed their responses through nine variables measuring how they adopted different elements of open scholarly knowledge (Table 1) in view of the UNESCO recommendations for open science.&#x0D; The results show elements related to open scholarly publications prevail. Almost 70% of respondentspublish either gold, green, or hybrid OA publications. Most society publishers reported to support open data policies only some do collect, store, and provide open access to research datasets. Furthermore, only a few societies offer training for opening research data. Even so, a high share of publishers offers open education, and some share their educational materials openly. Although earlier studies have reported differences in adopting open science between disciplines (Rousi &amp; Laakso, 2020), our analysis does not support these findings.However, it has confirmed that adopting the elements of open scholarly knowledge is cumulative, as OA publishers are more likely to take up other elements of open scholarly knowledge. However, adopting all elements is not yet common. Since activities (e.g. collecting research data, offering education, etc.) of publishers other than societies seem to influence the take up of these elements, further research of their activities is needed. For example, it will show how often and how openly these other publishers provide research data or education beyond.

AB  - Abstract Peer review plays an essential role as one of the cornerstones of the scholarly publishing system. There are many initiatives that aim to improve the way in which peer review is organized, resulting in a highly complex landscape of innovation in peer review. Different initiatives are based on different views on the most urgent challenges faced by the peer review system, leading to a diversity of perspectives on how the system can be improved. To provide a more systematic understanding of the landscape of innovation in peer review, we suggest that the landscape is shaped by four schools of thought: The Quality &amp; Reproducibility school, the Democracy &amp; Transparency school, the Equity &amp; Inclusion school, and the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school. Each school has a different view on the key problems of the peer review system and the innovations necessary to address these problems. The schools partly complement each other, but we argue that there are also important tensions between them. We hope that the four schools of thought offer a useful framework to facilitate conversations about the future development of the peer review system.

AB  - Peer reviewing is critical in the process of legitimizing new scientific knowledge. Yet, concerns about its quality exist, especially if one considers developmental reviewing as an ideal. In this essay, I suggest three ways to improve review quality: provide reviewers with systematic feedback about their performance, reward active and good reviewers, and make reviewers more accountable by revealing their identities to the authors in certain conditions.

AB  - The Internet has enabled an easy method to search through the vast majority of publications and has improved the impact of scholarly journals. However, it can also pose threats to the quality of published articles. New publishers and journals have emerged so-called open-access potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers and journals, and so-called hijacked journals. It was our aim to increase the awareness and warn scholars, especially young researchers, how to recognize these journals and how to avoid submission of their papers to these journals.Review and critical analysis of the relevant published literature, Internet sources and personal experience, thoughts, and observations of the authors.The web blog of Jeffrey Beall, University of Colorado, was greatly consulted. Jeffrey Beall is a Denver academic librarian who regularly maintains two lists: the first one, of potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers and the second one, of potential, possible, or probable predatory standalone journals. Aspects related to this topic presented by other authors have been discussed as well.Academics should bear in mind how to differentiate between trustworthy and reliable journals and predatory ones, considering: publication ethics, peer-review process, international academic standards, indexing and abstracting, preservation in digital repositories, metrics, sustainability, etc.

AB  - ABSTRACT The paper summarizes the findings of a pilot study for the National Humanities Alliance, including the methodology, research tools, analysis, and initial conclusions about the publishing business of eight association published humanities and social sciences journals in the context of a move to an open access (author/producer pays) publishing model. The eight disciplines represented by these journals are modern languages, history, religion, economics, sociology, anthropology, politics and statistics. Specific tools were developed for the study to enable like‐for‐like comparison of the journals. Detailed information on current trends in revenue, costs, and surplus is included. Significant differences between HSS and STM journals are reviewed. Open access to research articles on publication as the ‘gold’ author/producer‐pays approach would not be sustainable for this sample of HSS journals for reasons articulated in the report. Further studies using the tools and methodology developed are required to broaden and confirm these results.

AB  - Predatory publishing has risen with the development of open access publishing. This study examines how many potential predatory journals were used by Brandon University students by analyzing their bibliographies. In total, 245 bibliographies including 2,359 citations were analyzed. Of the 1,485 citations to journals in these citations, five were found to cite journals on Beall’s List of Predatory Journals and Publishers. The probable sources of these journals in the students’ bibliographies were examined.

AB  - Previous research on faculty publication venue choice at R1 institutions reveals tension between the benefits of open access and institutional pressure for faculty to publish in specific journals for review purposes. How does this tension percolate through regional campuses with different institutional priorities, and what can these contexts reveal about publishing practices and priorities for different kinds of faculty? In this study, the authors used content analysis on transcripts of interviews of sixteen faculty from regional campuses of an R1 institution to better understand the perception of open access publications as a venue choice.

AB  - Following the examples of SCOAP3, in which libraries fund open access, and eLife, in which funding agencies have begun to directly fund open access scholarly publishing, this study presents an analysis of how creatively combining these two models might provide a means to move toward universal open access (without APCs). This study calculates the publishing costs for the funders that sponsor the research and for the libraries that cover unsponsored articles for two nonprofit biomedical publishers, eLife and PLOS, and the nonprofit journal aggregator BioOne. These entities represent a mix of publishing revenue models, including funder sponsorship, article processing charges (APC), and subscription fees. Using PubMed filtering and manual-sampling strategies, as well as publicly available publisher revenue data, the study found that, in 2015, 86 percent of the articles in eLife and PLOS acknowledge funder support, as do 76 percent of the articles in the largely subscription journals of BioOne. Such findings can inform libraries and funding agencies, as well as publishers, in their consideration of a direct-payment open access model, as the study (a) demonstrates the cost breakdown for funder and library support for open access among this sample of X articles; (b) posits how publishing data-management organizations such as Crossref and ORCID can facilitate such a model of funder and library per-article open access payments; and (c) proposes ways in which such a model offers a more efficient, equitable, and scalable approach to open access across the disciplines than the prevailing APC model, which originated with biomedical publishing.

AB  - The viability of gold open access publishing models into the future will depend, in part, on the attitudes of authors toward open access (OA). In a survey of academics at four major research universities in North America, we examine academic authors’ opinions and behaviors toward gold OA. The study allows us to see what academics know and perceive about open access models, their current behavior in regard to publishing in OA, and possible future behavior. In particular, we gauge current attitudes to examine the perceived likelihood of various outcomes in an all-open access publishing scenario. We also survey how much authors at these types of universities would be willing to pay for article processing charges (APCs) from different sources. Although the loudest voices may often be heard, in reality there is a wide range of attitudes and behaviors toward publishing. Understanding the range of perceptions, opinions, and behaviors among academics toward gold OA is important for academic librarians who must examine how OA serves their research communities, to prepare for an OA future, and to understand how OA impacts the library’s role.

AB  - Abstract This article analyses the impact and visibility of scholarly journals in the humanities that are publishing in the national languages in Finland, Norway and Spain. Three types of publishers are considered: commercial publishers, scholarly society as publisher, and research organizations as publishers. Indicators of visibility and impact were obtained from Web of Science, SCOPUS, Google Metrics, Scimago Journal Rank and Journal Citation Report. The findings compiled show that in Spain the categories “History and Archaeology” and “Language and Literature” account for almost 70% of the journals analysed, while the other countries offer a more homogeneous distribution. In Finland, the scholarly society publisher is predominant, in Spain, research organization as publishers, mostly universities, have a greater weighting, while in Norway, the commercial publishers take centre stage. The results show that journals from Finland and Norway will have reduced possibilities in terms of impact and visibility, since the vernacular language appeals to a smaller readership. Conversely, the Spanish journals are more attractive for indexing in commercial databases. Distribution in open access ranges from 64 to 70% in Norwegian and Finish journals, and to 91% in Spanish journals. The existence of DOI range from 31 to 41% in Nordic journals to 60% in Spanish journals and has a more widespread bearing on the citations received in all three countries (journals with DOI and open access are cited more frequently).

AB  - Abstract Institutional repositories (IR) maintained by research libraries play a central role in providing open access to taxpayer-funded research products. It is difficult to measure the extent to which IR contribute to new scholarship because publisher self-archiving policies typically require researchers to cite the “version of record” of a manuscript even when an IR copy is accessed to conduct the research. While some studies report an open access (OA) citation advantage resulting from the availability of self-archived or “green” OA manuscripts, few have sought to measure an OA citation effect of IR separately from disciplinary repositories, including arXiv and PubMed Central. In this study, the authors present a bibliometric analysis examining correlations between search engine performance of items in IR, OA availability from different types of repositories, and citations. The analysis uses a novel, open dataset of IR access and usage derived from five months of Google search engine results pages (SERP) data, which were aggregated by the Repository Analytics and Metrics Portal (RAMP) web service. Findings indicate that making OA copies of manuscripts available in self-archiving or “green” repositories results in a positive citation effect, although the disciplinary repositories within the sample significantly outperform the other types of OA services analyzed. Also evident is an increase in citations when a single manuscript is available in multiple OA sources.

AB  - From my perspective as Managing Director for the Directory of Open Access Journals, I will discuss the most important issues related to furthering the momentum of Gold Open Access Publishing. The issues I will discuss will be improving the transparency and credibility of Open Access Publishing and what a service like DOAJ tries to contribute in that regard. I will discuss the problems related to Hybrid Open Access publishing especially in relation to the way that the open access mandate United Kingdom has adopted, which has led to huge support to Hybrid OA-publishing at the expense of pure OA-publishing, which has given OA-publishing a bad name in the UK. As well I will discuss the need for marginalizing and eliminating the problem of unethical, questionable OA-publishers. Further I will discuss a number of future demands on Open Access journals in terms of providing more granular measures of impact (beyond the terrible Journal Impact Factor), the need for policies related to research data and related issues.

AB  - We discuss the scholarly publication model and the impact of the current technological change on knowledge and communication generally on the scholarly publication model. We propose that, rather than open access being the cause of the apparent and impending collapse of the scholarly publication industry, it is but one driver of a far wider change in scholarly publication. That change will have effects that extend well beyond the simple decision of whether a publication should be available by subscription or by one of the forms of open access. We also present several other changes to scholarly publication. The change is inevitable but its extent is as yet unclear.

AB  - SUMMARY Some scholars have urged dramatically new models for scholarly publishing, often condemning learned societies for their failure to embrace those models. Why are societies cautious? Because they have experience. They recognize that many of the enthusiastic efforts to provide open access to all scholarly literature may ultimately have the opposite effect.

AB  - The open science and research (OSR) movement has been shaping the world of scholarly communication for a few years now. In Finland, the Ministry of Education and Culture promoted research information availability and open science through the Open Science and Research Initiative. As a part of this initiative, an evaluation of the openness of Finnish research organizations was completed. The first evaluation indicated that OSR functions needed clearer guidelines and a coordinating unit to further improve the cultural maturity in Lahti University of Applied Sciences (LAMK). Furthermore, the scholarly publishing activities also needed a new home base due to organizational changes. As the information and library services had the basic understanding of scholarly publishing, different publishing channels and responsible conduct of research, it was decided that the library takes on these responsibilities.&#x0D; For the new challenges, the traditional information specialist skills set needed updating. New skills were acquired via both formal and informal learning, benchmarking and trial-and-error. These new skills were immediately put to use in LAMK by creating a new open access publishing platform, organizing workshops and lectures for the staff and creating organizational guidelines for open RDI practices. The next organizational maturity evaluation ranking round proved the library’s new expertise, as LAMK climbed two levels up, being the second highest university of applied sciences in Finland.&#x0D; As for the role of the information specialists, the new role as OSR experts have opened up new possibilities within the organization. They are now seen more as possible partners in different RDI activities, participating in project work and further developing the way openness is being carried out in all aspects of RDI and teaching. The paper offers a case example of how library professionals can diversify and update their skills pool and shape the future of their profession.

AB  - The increasing volume and complexity of research, scholarly publication, and research information puts an added strain on traditional methods of scholarly communication and evaluation. Information goods and networks are not standard market goods – and so we should not rely on markets alone to develop new forms of scholarly publishing. The affordances of digital information and networks create many opportunities to unbundle the functions of scholarly communication – the central challenge is to create a range of new forms of publication that effectively promote both market and collaborative ecosystems.

AB  - Institutional repositories represent extremely innovative technology, but repository managers still struggle to bring together a critical mass of content and to demonstrate their overall impact on research. In this paper I propose a set of Performance Indicators (PIs) to assess institutional repositories’ success. Fourteen internal indicators are selected and inserted in the quadruple ‘balanced scorecard’ perspective. Three more indicators from an external perspective are then proposed and discussed by the author. I hope that this study will foster the development of standard Performance Indicators for IRs in the very near future, in order to help IR managers to demonstrate their repositories’ cost-effectiveness and success.

AB  - Abstract This paper reviews how Open Access policies (OA) and Institutional Repositories (IR) might be portrayed as agents of change within the realm of scholarly publishing. Using commentary on academic publishing as background, commentary that sees OA and IR as optimal and inevitable, and beneficially disruptive of the existing system, two theoretical approaches are presented as ways of providing a more detailed and explicit analysis of OA/IR dynamics. Both theories to varying degrees derive their inspiration from an exploration of the nature of change. The first “disruptive technology/disruptive innovation” approach (Christensen) specifies change in market theory terms, a re‐structuring ‘driven’ by innovation within, and possibly disruptive of, existing market arrangements. The second approach views change as a process of ‘reassembling’ and reconfiguring of relationships between elements of a network (Actor‐Network Theory). The application of both approaches to OA/IR is explored, including reference to a case study on a university institutional repository implementation. While ‘disruption’ and similar terms might be in common and casual use, the basic idea gains greater clarity in these theories, and in doing so promotes greater awareness of the assumptions being made, and the aspirations being pursued.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present the institutional repository (IR) named DRUGG (Digital Repository of the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering) of the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering (UL FGG), just from its beginnings in 2011, and using the statistics of visits to present its merits for higher visibility of scholarly publications on the web. The role of all stakeholders involved in the construction of this IR is highlighted. Design/methodology/approach – The historical overview of the awareness of researchers on the UL FGG on worldwide scientific communication through web sites is showed from beginning in the 1990s. Using Google Analytics the statistics of visits and downloads after a year of operations is showed, as well as the statistics of access from different networks from all over the world. Findings – In the DRUGG repository mainly theses are archived which are usually not published elsewhere. They are very interesting for professional engineers working in practice. The statistics showed that 89 per cent of all visits come from public domains, while only 11 per cent are from the home domain of the University of Ljubljana (UL). Research limitations/implications – This paper is a case study and limited only to IR DRUGG. It describes the steps taken in implementing the IR considering the technological infrastructure, human resources and collaboration of the library staff with other professional and administrative faculty units. Practical implications – The repository is to a large extent used by the professional public and that the use is not limited only to the home institution – UL. Originality/value – This paper helps in planning to build an IR. It also presents an overview of worldwide research and analysis about the influence of IRs on citations of scholarly publications to convince the sceptical research policy makers.

AB  - The need for a comprehensive infrastructure for scholarly publication information has been on the EU’s agenda for a long time. Also, the European Commission’s open science policy highlights the necessity of a good information base to follow up open access publishing across Europe. However, an all-inclusive information infrastructure on research publications is still missing. During the past 10 years, European countries have invested significantly in national research information infrastructures. Now, at least 20 European countries have a national database for research publication metadata. The strength of these databases lies in their comprehensiveness and quality assurance since they often have a mandatory nature. They are, however, neither yet integrated nor widely used for cross- country comparisons. To this end, a proof of concept of a European publication infrastructure was carried out in the framework of ENRESSH ( www.enressh.eu ). The ENRESSH-VIRTA-PoC integrated publication data from four countries and the concept was built on the strengths of the Finnish national VIRTA system. This paper highlights the results from the PoC and outlines future steps towards the integration of national publication databases in Europe.

AB  - We report on the development of an interface to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that allows for the mapping of patent portfolios as overlays to basemaps constructed from citation relations among all patents contained in this database during the period 1976–2011. Both the interface and the data are in the public domain; the freeware programs VOSViewer and/or Pajek can be used for the visualization. These basemaps and overlays can be generated at both the 3-digit and 4-digit levels of the International Patent Classification (IPC) of the world intellectual property organization (WIPO). The basemaps can provide a stable mental framework for analysts to follow developments over searches for different years, which can be animated. The full flexibility of the advanced search engines of USPTO are available for generating sets of patents and/or patent applications which can thus be visualized and compared. This instrument allows for addressing questions about technological distance, diversity in portfolios, and animating the developments of both technologies and technological capacities of organizations over time.

AB  - Quantitative data are increasingly influencing the evaluation of the effectiveness of research and researchers. Citations may be the main metric to assess the quality and value of a publication, the number of which evaluates the academic impact. Who and how is citing Ukrainian scholarly journals? And speaking about citations, what are the main connections and trends? To study these aspects, we analyzed the citations of two “young” Ukrainian journals published by the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. The authors searched for articles published by two journals (Kyiv-Mohyla Humanities Journal and Kyiv-Mohyla Law and Politics Journal) in the citation databases Dimensions, Web of Science and Scopus. With the help of bibliometric analysis, such indicators as: citation; self-citation of the author; self-citation of the journal; citations from the author affiliated with the publisher of the journal; citations from the author who has a joint affiliation with the author of the article; Altmetric Attention Score. The purpose of the study is to distinguish the publications impact in various fields of knowledge in Open Access journals for researchers around the world, the growing number of citations for English-language publications, the importance of international publishing standards, correlations for self-citation, etc. An important aim is also to summarize the importance of journal indexing in different databases. The study showed that the number of journal citations is primarily influenced by the thematic relevance of published materials. Including, the subject of the article (volume, issue) has a strong correlation with the dynamics and geography of the citations. The number of self-citations of authors, self-citations of the journal, as well as citations from the joint affiliation with the author and publisher was insignificant. No significant impact on the number of citations was also found in the date of publication and its distribution on the Internet (Altmetric). Journal indexing in abstract, full-text databases and citation databases also affects their visibility and audience.

AB  - This paper examines the evolving relationship between Canada and the African academic research community through the promotion of a concept known as Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) and with an eye to its implications for increasing the circulation of research through such means as open access (OA) publishing models. We analyze the programmatic discourse of Canada’s International Development Research Centre’s (IDRC) African research initiatives, and report on an IDRC research and development project assessing the means of increasing access to African scholarly journals through the use of open source software platforms and open access publishing and archiving models. Consistent with IDRC’s multi-year effort to contribute directly to university-based research capacities by investing in ICT infrastructure in Africa, our survey of African editors, librarians, and faculty from five African nations reveals a similar interest in developing those capacities, despite numerous challenges, through the use of online publishing systems and OA publishing models, which hold some promise of increasing access to research published in Africa.&#x0D;

AB  - Background: Open access (OA) implies free and unrestricted access to and re-use of research articles. Recently, OA publishing has seen a new wave of interest, debate, and practices surrounding that mode of publishing. Obj ectives: To provide an overview of publication practices and to compare them among six countries across the world to stimulate further debate and to raise awareness about OA to facilitate decision-making on further development of OA practices in earth sciences. M e th ods: The number of OA articles, their distribution among the six countries, and top ten journals publishing OA articles were identified using two databases, namely Scopus and the Web of Science, based mainly on the data for 2018. Results: In 2018, only 24%&amp;ndash;31% of the total number of articles indexed by either of the databases were OA articles. Six of the top ten earth sciences journals that publish OA articles were fully OA journals and four were hybrid journals. Fully OA journals were mostly published by emerging publishers and their article processing charges ranged from $1000 to $2200. Conclusions: The rise in OA publishing has potential implications for researchers and tends to shift article-processing charges from organizations to individuals. Until the earth sciences community decides to move away from journal-based criteria to evaluate researchers, it is likely that such high costs will continue to maintain financial inequities within this research community, especially to the disadvantage of researchers from the least developed countries. However, earth scientists, by opting for legal self- archiving of their publications, could help to promote equitable and sustainable access to, and wider dissemination of, their work.

These two distinct types of scientist compete for academic prestige, research funding, and international recognition. International research collaboration proves to be a powerful stratifying force. As a clearly defined subgroup, internationalists are a different academic species, accounting for 51.4% of Polish scientists; predominantly male and older, they have longer academic experience and higher academic degrees and occupy higher academic positions. Across all academic clusters, internationalists consistently produce more than 90% of internationally co-authored publications, representing 2320% of locals’ productivity for peer-reviewed articles and 1600% for peer-reviewed article equivalents. Internationalists tend to spend less time than locals on teaching-related activities, more time on research, and more time on administrative duties. Based on a large-scale academic survey ( N = 3704), some new predictors of international research collaboration were identified by multivariate analyses. The findings have global policy implications for resource-poor science systems “playing catch-up” in terms of academic careers, productivity patterns, and research internationalization policies.

AB  - Introduction The Council of Science Editors (CSE), as an organization for editorial professionals publishing in the sciences,1 intrinsically provides professional development for industry professionals. Attending an annual meeting, joining a virtual event, accessing a Science Editor article, or participating as a committee member all bolster connections with the network of scholarly publishing professionals while increasing knowledge of industry standards. CSE’s Professional Development Committee is devoted to ensuring CSE members are provided career development opportunities. While only a fraction of CSE’s offerings fall under the purview of the Professional Development Committee, the committee promotes professional development within all CSE events, resources, and membership benefits. The committee is charged with providing a network for career development and does so through the implementation of networking opportunities, management of the CSE Publication Certificate Program, and continued assessment of the professional development needs of CSE members. Some opportunities provided include CSE Connect, the CSE Book Club, and the CSE S.P.E.A.K Podcast. CSE Connect CSE Connect events aim to support networking and connectivity among CSE members, ideally while learning about topics that apply to scholarly communication professionals at various career stages and organizations. Recent CSE Connect topics include the Early Career Roundtable, CSE Editor Roundtable, The Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffle, and Poster Submission 101. CSE members are encouraged to submit suggestions for topics and presenters, and CSE Connect events are free to attend for members and non-members.2 Encouraging your coworkers, mentors, and mentees to join us is applauded. CSE Connect events typically last 30–45 […]

AB  - Institutional repositories (IRs) currently exist in a rapidly shifting landscape without a clear consensus on their role in the academic environment. Low self-archiving rates have dampened hopes that IRs would have an impact on scholarly publishing models. Preservation programs, a stated goal of many IRs, are often not well established. In many cases, IRs are not part of a larger vision for services the library can provide to the institution, but are isolated projects without a strong base of support. Institutions are beginning to explore the role of IRs in the collection of materials like data sets. Given this environment, where will IRs be in the next five or ten years? This issue of Library Trends contains an impressive slate of articles from prominent practitioners and researchers in the field, who offer a range of perspectives on the current state of IRs in academic institutions and reflections on their future.

AB  - Purpose This is a comparative investigation of how university libraries in the United States, Canada and Spanish-speaking Latin America are responding to predatory publishing. Design/methodology/approach The Times Higher Education World University Rankings was used to identify the top ten universities from each of the US and Canada, as well as the top 20 Spanish-language universities in Latin America. Each university library's website was scrutinized to discover whether the libraries employed scholarly communication librarians, whether they offered scholarly communication workshops, or whether they shared information about scholarly communication on their websites. This information was further examined to determine if it discussed predatory publishing specifically. Findings Most libraries in the US/Canada sample employ scholarly communication librarians and nearly half offer workshops on predatory publishing. No library in the Latin America sample employed a scholarly communication specialist and just one offered a workshop addressing predatory publishing. The websites of the libraries in the US and Canada addressed predatory publishing both indirectly and directly, with US libraries favoring the former approach and Canadian libraries tending towards the latter. Predatory publishing was rarely addressed directly by the libraries in the Latin America sample; however, all discussed self-archiving and/or Open Access. Research limitations/implications Brazilian universities were excluded owing to the researchers' language limitations. Data were collected between September 15 and 30, 2019, so it represents a snapshot of information available at that time. The study was limited to an analysis of library websites using a fixed set of keywords, and it did not investigate whether other campus units were involved or whether other methods of informing researchers about predatory publishing were being used. Originality/value The study reveals some best practices leading to recommendations to help academic libraries combat predatory publishing and improve scholarly publishing literacy among researchers.

AB  - Abstract Contributorship statements were introduced by scholarly journals in the late 1990s to provide more details on the specific contributions made by authors to research papers. After more than a decade of idiosyncratic taxonomies by journals, a partnership between medical journals and standards organizations has led to the establishment, in 2015, of the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT), which provides a standardized set of 14 research contributions. Using the data from Public Library of Science (PLOS) journals over the 2017–2018 period (N = 30,054 papers), this paper analyzes how research contributions are divided across research teams, focusing on the association between division of labor and number of authors, and authors’ position and specific contributions. It also assesses whether some contributions are more likely to be performed in conjunction with others and examines how the new taxonomy provides greater insight into the gendered nature of labor division. The paper concludes with a discussion of results with respect to current issues in research evaluation, science policy, and responsible research practices.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of the study This study aims to describe all unsolicited electronic invitations received from potential predatory publishers or fraudulent conferences over a 12-month period following the first publication as a corresponding author of a junior academician. Study design Unsolicited invitations received at an institutional email address and perceived to be sent by predatory publishers or fraudulent conferences were collected. Results A total of 502 invitations were included of which 177 (35.3%) had subject matter relevant to the recipient’s research interests and previous work. Two hundred and thirty-seven were invitations to publish a manuscript. Few disclosed the publication fees (32, 13.5%) but they frequently reported accepting all types of manuscripts (167, 70.5%) or emphasised on a deadline to submit (165, 69.6%). Invitations came from 39 publishers (range 1 to 87 invitations per publisher). Two hundred and ten invitations from a potential fraudulent conference were received. These meetings were held in Europe (97, 46.2%), North America (65, 31.0%), Asia (20.4%) or other continents (5, 2.4%) and came from 18 meeting organisation groups (range 1 to 137 invitations per organisation). Becoming an editorial board member (30), the editor-in-chief (1), a guest editor for journal special issue (6) and write a book chapter (11) were some of the roles offered in the other invitations included while no invitation to review a manuscript was received. Conclusions Young researchers are commonly exposed to predatory publishers and fraudulent conferences following a single publication as a corresponding author. Academic institutions worldwide need to educate and inform young researchers of this emerging problem.

AB  - Open access is at the heart of a seismic shift in scholarly publishing. In particular, gold open access (OA) has expanded at an accelerated pace, increasing in market share every year. In the gold OA model, financial viability shifts from the demand to the supply side, with article processing charges (APCs) a common scenario. Ideally, this model would be sustainable for academic research institutions, in that it would cost them cumulatively no more to pay APCs than they pay now in the traditional subscription model. APC-driven gold OA has financial and other implications for libraries, institutions, and authors. In the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-funded Pay It Forward project, we examined the viability of gold OA by looking at institutional costs, faculty and graduate student opinions, and various models for gold OA. The Pay It Forward research teams gathered a variety of qualitative and quantitative data from publishers, research libraries, and faculty and students including current APC charges, current subscription charges, journal publication costs, opinions and behavior of graduate students and faculty members regarding publishing, reading, and OA.

IS  - 46
AU  - Cheng, An

AB  - Open access journals (OAJs) have been celebrated for freeing research from paywalls and increasing the visibility of research results beyond disciplinary, academic, or financial boundaries. They have been recognized as an important part of the Open Science (OS) ecology. However, they are still viewed by some with skepticism. Given these conflicting perceptions, it would be important for LSP researchers and practitioners to understand OAJs better as they may need to work with students who are or will be part of the OS movement. Examining how open access journals describe themselves in their “Aims and Scope” (A&amp;S) statement is a worthwhile step in this direction. I analyzed the A&amp;S statements of 104 OAJs and 104 subscription-based journals. I conducted thematic analysis aided by NVivo. Although both groups of journals include some broad themes in their A&amp;S statements, there are some observable differences in the way they describe their scope and promote themselves. Using the concept of the prestige economy, I offer two theoretical insights: the OAJs journals may be selfconsciously and purposefully responding to the expectations of the prestige economy. Meanwhile, they may be redefining what is relevant in such an economy.

AB  - There is concern in the academic publishing community that it is becoming more difficult to secure reviews for peer-reviewed manuscripts, but much of this concern stems from anecdotal and rhetorical evidence.We examined the proportion of review requests that led to a completed review over a 6-year period (2009-2015) in a mid-tier biology journal (Molecular Ecology). We also re-analyzed previously published data from four other mid-tier ecology journals (Functional Ecology, Journal of Ecology, Journal of Animal Ecology, and Journal of Applied Ecology), looking at the same proportion over the period 2003 to 2010.The data from Molecular Ecology showed no significant decrease through time in the proportion of requests that led to a review (proportion in 2009 = 0.47 (95 % CI = 0.43 to 0.52), proportion in 2015 = 0.44 (95 % CI = 0.40 to 0.48)). This proportion did decrease for three of the other ecology journals (changes in proportions from 2003 to 2010 = -0.10, -0.18, and -0.09), while the proportion for the fourth (Functional Ecology) stayed roughly constant (change in proportion = -0.04).Overall, our data suggest that reviewer agreement rates have probably declined slightly but not to the extent suggested by the anecdotal and rhetorical evidence.

AB  - Openness, applied in scholarly and research practices, has garnered increasing interest in recent years. With the broadening reach of Open Access as an alternative scholarly publishing model, there is anticipation that open scholarship practices will produce desirable outcomes for research and access to knowledge. The purpose of this article is twofold: firstly to highlight that Open Access is more than just the removal of paywalls, and that it is part of a wider set of open practices that can potentially yield a more collaborative and equitable global landscape of knowledge production. Secondly, to present the IDS Bulletin as a case study for an Open Access publication that has evolved to adapt to a changing scholarly publishing landscape. By critiquing prevalent discourse on openness alongside this case study, we hope that this article contributes to conversations on issues at the intersection of open scholarship, collaborative research and equitable access to knowledge.

AB  - Authors often ask how long the peer review process takes. Peer review duration has attracted much attention in academia in recent years. Existing research focuses primarily on the statistical characteristics of peer review duration, with few studies considering the potential influence of manuscripts’ attractiveness. This study aims to fill this research gap by employing attention economy theory. By analysing the peer review history of articles published in The British Medical Journal and 16 information and library science journals, we find a significant negative relationship between peer review duration and the Altmetric Attention Score. Overall, our study offers a new perspective on peer review behaviour and bridges the divide between peer reviews and altmetrics.

AB  - This article uses Alan B. Krueger’s analysis of the music industry in his book Rockonomics: A Backstage Tour of What the Music Industry Can Teach Us About Economics and Life as a lens to consider the structure of scholarly publishing and what could happen to scholarly publishing going forward. Both the music industry and scholarly publishing are facing disruption as their products become digital. Digital content provides opportunities to a create a better product at lower prices and in the music industry this has happened. Scholarly publishing has not yet done so. Similarities and differences between the music industry and scholarly publishing will be considered. Like music, scholarly publishing appears to be a superstar industry. Both music and scholarly publishing are subject to piracy, which threatens revenue, though Napster was a greater disrupter than Sci-Hub seems to be. It also appears that for a variety of reasons market forces are not effective in driving changes in business models and practices in scholarly publishing, at least not at the rate we would expect given the changes in technology. After reviewing similarities and differences, the prospects for the future of scholarly publishing will be considered.

AB  - Purpose Women remain underrepresented in the production of scientific literature, and relatively little is known regarding the labor roles played by women in the production of knowledge. This study examined labor roles by gender using contributorship data from science and medical journals published by the Public Library of Science (PLOS), which require each author to indicate their contribution to one or more of the following tasks: (1) analyzed the data, (2) conceived and designed the experiments, (3) contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, (4) performed the experiments, and (5) wrote the paper. Method The authors analyzed contribution data from more than 85,000 articles published between 2008 and 2013 in PLOS journals with respect to gender using both descriptive and regression analyses. Results Gender was a significant variable in determining the likelihood of performing a certain task associated with authorship. Women were significantly more likely to be associated with performing experiments, and men were more likely to be associated with all other authorship roles. This holds true controlling for academic age: Although experimentation was associated with academically younger scholars, the gap between male and female contribution to this task remained constant across academic age. Inequalities were observed in the distribution of scientific labor roles. Conclusions These disparities have implications for the production of scholarly knowledge, the evaluation of scholars, and the ethical conduct of science. Adopting the practice of identifying contributorship rather than authorship in scientific journals will allow for greater transparency, accountability, and equitable allocation of resources.

VL  - 1

AB  - It is axiomatic that there has never been so much research productivity as in the present time. Not only are there more trained scientists alive and productive today than at any other point in history, but the last 25 years have also brought ever increasing gains in the speed and quantity of information delivery and in our ability to store scientific knowledge electronically. This is certainly true of medical knowledge as well, and by extension, of the scientific discoveries and knowledge translation insights that help society to avert illness, prolong life, and promote health for individuals and their communities. Therefore, the answer to the question in the title of this editorial is an unequivocal ‘yes’, if we assume quite simplistically that the exponential gains in research productivity represent knowledge that is all of high quality and relevance to advance the theory and practice of preventive medicine. A more refined question is: How will this new journal operate?As the founding co-editors of Preventive Medicine Reports (PMR), we bring our new journal to the scientific community at a time when the business of scholarly publishing is being drastically remodeled. The advent of the ‘open access’ concept in academic publishing democratized access to scientific knowledge by making all papers freely available to anyone with an Internet connection, thus eliminating the need for an individual or institution to have a paid subscription. It was able to do so by shifting the costs of publishing to the source of information, i.e., authors, their institutions, and by association, the research funding agencies. Publishing electronically also lowered the costs of being an academic publisher enormously. The ‘open access’ model has begun to abolish the centuries-long inequality in access to knowledge, which had historically placed investigators in developing countries at a major disadvantage relatively to their counterparts in resource-rich settings. This inequality was particularly poignant in preventive medicine. The very countries with the greatest need for access to scientific discoveries that could alleviate their key public health concerns were prevented from doing so because their scientists and academic institutions could not afford it. The enormous success of organizations such as Public Library of Science (PLOS) and Biomed Central (BMC), which devoted themselves entirely as publishers of multiple open-access journals, was the most notable transformation in academic publishing in the last 15 years. One of these journals, PLOS One, went from a respectable 138 papers in its inaugural year in 2006 to become the largest scientific journal in the world and in history, with 31,500 articles published in 2013 alone [1].To a large extent, the spectacular success of PLOS One stemmed from its approach of not reaching decisions on whether to prioritize for peer review and publication based on criteria of relevance and interest to readers set a priori by editors and reviewers. With print journal space concerns largely obviated in the new era of electronic publishing, PLOS One's editorial policy is to accept for publication all submissions that contain intelligibly written and sound scientific findings from yet unpublished primary research studies that were conducted ethically and with integrity [2]. Peer review ensures that the decision to publish is based on pertinent content and methodological expertise. The success of this model of sound-science exclusive review is now being adopted by other traditional publishers, and is likely to dictate much of what will happen with scientific publishing in the future.The down side of the open-access model is that it was quickly perceived by pseudo-scholarly publishers as a relatively easy way to make money via catering to credulous scientists with an urgent need to publish their results. These so-called ‘predatory publishers’ [3] are likely the majority of the providers of what passes for scientific knowledge today under the guise of open access publishing. A recent compilation of potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers included 589 entries, an enormous growth since 2011 when the list was first compiled and included only 18 publishers [4].The need for PMR arises from the fact that much high quality research in prevention is of a more specialized or regional nature, but which contains sound scientific findings worthy of being placed in the public domain. By opening this new avenue, we seek to enhance knowledge translation in preventive medicine and public health. We would like to attract such important research material to PMR, a journal that is maintained by the largest of the reputable academic publishers, Elsevier. PMR will follow the open access, sound-science centered peer review model pioneered by PLOS One, which is described in our scope and aims statement as follows:“Preventive Medicine Reports is an international, open-access peer-reviewed journal affiliated with Preventive Medicine, the medical journal founded by Ernst Wynder in 1972. Like its parent journal, Preventive Medicine Reports publishes original, scholarly manuscripts on the science and practice of disease prevention, health promotion, and public health policymaking but seeks to broaden our understanding and perspective on these topics by including a wider selection of geographic and population specific studies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the impact of lifestyle and interventions on health and the role of the man-made environment on lifestyle choices. The journal welcomes submissions, especially primary reports, on the science of preventing chronic and infectious diseases; the effects of the chemical, physical, and biological environment on health, and research on the relations between socioeconomic status, health disparities, and access to care. Preventive Medicine Reports also publishes papers that have a subspecialty angle or a methodological focus. Its primary goal is to serve as a scholarly repository for the building blocks of research knowledge that inform practice and policy in disease prevention and health promotion.”Many well established subscription journals have spawned offshoot open access journals. Elsevier has had a positive experience with this model in some of its journals. For example, Molecular Genetics and Metabolism, a subscription journal, has spawned MGM Reports, an exclusively open access journal. Other Elsevier journals that are in the same pairing model are: Cell and Cell Reports, The Lancet and The Lancet Global Health, and Gene and Meta Gene. In general, they have the benefit of simplifying authors' work by allowing a manuscript to be transferred to the sister journal along with the reviewers' critiques.With PMR and its direct cooperation with its parent journal, Preventive Medicine, we have a great opportunity to innovate in scholarly publishing in public health and give authors the opportunity to keep their valid work with an established academic journal. The same experienced editorial office team that manages Preventive Medicine will maintain the day-to-day operation for PMR. Its decisions will receive guidance from a stellar editorial board of seasoned scientists, as well as from the input of ad hoc reviewers registered in a database of nearly 4000 experienced academics and practitioners of preventive medicine.Our intent is to attract the attention of our colleagues in the fields of preventive medicine and health promotion. We are confident that PMR will earn the trust and credibility that Preventive Medicine already enjoys. As co-editors we pledge to procure competent, insightful, and unbiased peer reviews for all papers that fit the scope of PMR. Between the two of us, we have more than 60 years of experience in the epidemiology of chronic and infectious diseases, psychosocial research, and the behavioral sciences, which will give PMR an eclectic skillset with which to start fresh in this brave new world of scholarly publishing.

AB  - ABSTRACT Open access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. The lack of clarity of publisher permissions for archiving in OA repositories affects the adoption of the green OA route. This paper explores editorial policies and self‐archiving conditions in 1,615 Spanish scholarly journals. 48% are published by university and research institutions, 25% by associations/societies, and 17% by commercial publishers; social sciences and humanities (SSH) accounted for 67% of the journals (44.5% and 22.5%, respectively) followed by health sciences (20%); 71% offered gratis access immediately after publication, and 11% after an embargo; 31% provided some mention of author rights. Self‐archiving was specifically allowed by 65% of the journals; 52% were classified as ROMEO‐blue, 12% as green and 15% as white, and 21% could not be classified; 21%, mostly in SSH, used some type of Creative Commons license.

AB  - The Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST) has been playing a vital role in the dissemination of scholarly articles in library and information science since 1950. This paper presents the results of a bibliometric study of articles published in the JASIST from 2000 to 2007. It examines the distribution of papers under various headings, including authorship pattern and nature of collaboration, geographic distribution of articles, nature of cited and citing references, prolific authors and highly cited authors. Data were collected using the Web of Science and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Results indicate that during the sample period the rate of publication was uneven and the most prominent form of publication was articles. The trend of authorship pattern of articles is towards collaboration and authors from 47 countries contributed articles. The country-wise distribution reveals that the highest number of contributions was made by US authors followed by the UK. The number of references cited per article increased from 2000—2007 whereas articles received citations in decreasing numbers during the same period. The results suggest that articles need to have been published for more than 2 years before they receive adequate numbers of citations.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to compute the Journal Packing Density (JPD) i.e. the average research articles published in each volume or each issue of a research journal. Library and Information Science (LIS) journals published across Asia and indexed in Scopus during the period 2015 to 2019 were taken as samples. The study is based on secondary data retrieved from SCImago Journal and Country Ranking (SJCR), which includes the journals and country scientific indicators developed from the information contained in the Scopus database. In all, 14 LIS journals were identified from Asia. It was found that there are 51 sovereign nations in Asia, and 43 (84.31%) countries are actively undertaking research in LIS and only 8 (18.60%) countries are publishing LIS journals. India and Taiwan are the two leading countries in the region publishing 3 journals each. In all, 1558 articles were published by 14 LIS journals across Asia from 2015 through 2019 in 58 volumes with a JPD of 26.86 articles per journal per volume. Apart from these, research deficit in terms of journals and research articles has also been computed alongside a brief overview on how JPD of a journal can help in identifying the possibility of its predatory nature.

AB  - Peer review practices differ substantially between journals and disciplines. This study presents the results of a survey of 322 editors of journals in ecology, economics, medicine, physics and psychology. We found that 49% of the journals surveyed checked all manuscripts for plagiarism, that 61% allowed authors to recommend both for and against specific reviewers, and that less than 6% used a form of open peer review. Most journals did not have an official policy on altering reports from reviewers, but 91% of editors identified at least one situation in which it was appropriate for an editor to alter a report. Editors were also asked for their views on five issues related to publication ethics. A majority expressed support for co-reviewing, reviewers requesting access to data, reviewers recommending citations to their work, editors publishing in their own journals, and replication studies. Our results provide a window into what is largely an opaque aspect of the scientific process. We hope the findings will inform the debate about the role and transparency of peer review in scholarly publishing.

AB  - ABSTRACT It is now widely accepted that there are two routes to open access (OA): OA repositories and OA journals. It is often assumed these are distinct alternative parallel tracks. However, it has recently become clear that there is potential for repositories and journals to interact with each other on an ongoing basis and between them to form a coherent OA scholarly communication system. This paper puts forward three possible models of interaction between repositories and journals; services such as arXiv and PubMed Central, and the work carried out by the RIOJA project, are working exemplars and pilot implementations of these models. The key issues associated with the widespread adoption of these models include repository infrastructure development; changing ideas of the ‘journal’, ‘article’, and ‘publication’; version management; quality assurance; business and funding models; developing value‐added features; content preservation; policy frameworks; and changing roles and cultures within the research community.

AB  - The increasing number of journals makes it difficult to decide the right venue for manuscript submission. This becomes more complicated as the selection criteria may vary from one discipline to another. Therefore, appropriate cross‐disciplinary studies are required to understand the exact concerns that dominate a particular field. The current study compares 16 factors that influence journal choices between medicine and social sciences using the answers given to a global survey of 235 open access journal authors. The results reveal that authors of both areas consider ‘peer reviewed’ status as the most important factor while showing the least interest to the ‘number of annual subscribers’ of the journal. However, compared to social science authors, those in the discipline of medicine give significantly more consideration to (1) impact factor, (2) the inclusion of the journal in abstracting and indexing services, (3) publisher's prestige, and (4) online submission with tracking facility. The factors that were identified can be categorized for both disciplines as reflecting the reputation of a journal, performance or production issues, and reliability and demand characteristics of their publication choice. The editors and publishers can use these findings to attract the best manuscripts as the study reveals the author's perception of the journal's status. The results can also be used to design recommender systems for journal submission for new authors in a discipline.

AB  - Abstract The list of potential, possible or probable predatory scholarly open access (OA) publishers compiled by Jeffrey Beall was examined to determine the effect of their inclusion upon authors, and a possible bias against OA journals. Manually collected data from the publication archives of a sample of 250 journals from Beall publishers reveals a strong tendency towards a decline in their article output during 2012–2020. A comparison of the subset of 506 Beall journals indexed in Scopus with a benchmark set of other OA journals in Scopus with similar characteristics shows that Beall journals reveal as a group a strong decline in citation impact over the years, and reached an impact level far below that of their benchmarks. The Beall list of publishers was found to be heterogeneous in terms of bibliometric indicators but to be clearly differentiated from OA journals not included in the list. The same bibliometric comparison against comparable non‐OA journals reveal similar, but less marked, differences in citation and publication growth.

AB  - Abstract Editors are journals’ entrepreneurs, managers, and stewards. They have the duty of holding high standards of scholarly quality in terms of end product (articles) and due process (adequate peer-review procedures). Given the importance of journals in the contemporary science “ecosystem,” editors emerge as decisive power brokers. Elite board members are scrutinizers but, paradoxically, they are themselves seldom subject to systematic study. This paper presents a comprehensive portrait of the editorship phenomenon in Innovation Studies by probing the structural features of the boards of 20 leading innovation-oriented journals as of 2019 and conducting an editor survey. We account for 2,440 individual editors in 3,005 different roles based in 53 countries. We uncover the overwhelming dominance of U.S.-affiliated editors and the contrasting rare presence of scholars from the Global South. The gender balance tilts toward men, with a weight above 60%. Enhanced journal achievement is associated with editors on multiple boards, diverse national representation, and increased women on boards. Almost 20% of scholars serve on multiple boards, and no single journal is free from this interlocking editorship phenomenon. The journal Research Policy is the most central in the cross-board network, followed by Industrial and Corporate Change. Finally, the implications of editormetrics for journal governance are discussed.

AB  - Background Despite having a crucial role in scholarly publishing, peer reviewers do not typically require any training. The purpose of this study was to conduct an international survey on the current perceptions and motivations of researchers regarding peer review training. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted of biomedical researchers. A total of 2000 corresponding authors from 100 randomly selected medical journals were invited via email. Quantitative items were reported using frequencies and percentages or means and SE, as appropriate. A thematic content analysis was conducted for qualitative items in which two researchers independently assigned codes to the responses for each written-text question, and subsequently grouped the codes into themes. A descriptive definition of each category was then created and unique themes–as well as the number and frequency of codes within each theme–were reported. Results A total of 186 participants completed the survey of which 14 were excluded. The majority of participants indicated they were men (n = 97 of 170, 57.1%), independent researchers (n = 108 of 172, 62.8%), and primarily affiliated with an academic organization (n = 103 of 170, 62.8%). A total of 144 of 171 participants (84.2%) indicated they had never received formal training in peer review. Most participants (n = 128, 75.7%) agreed–of which 41 (32.0%) agreed strongly–that peer reviewers should receive formal training in peer review prior to acting as a peer reviewer. The most preferred training formats were online courses, online lectures, and online modules. Most respondents (n = 111 of 147, 75.5%) stated that difficulty finding and/or accessing training was a barrier to completing training in peer review. Conclusion Despite being desired, most biomedical researchers have not received formal training in peer review and indicated that training was difficult to access or not available.

AB  - ABSTRACT The trend through which academia finances scientific publication has been changed into open access publishing, the latter is exploited by predatory journals and publishers. The aim of this paper is to review the current situation of predatory publishing and introduce Kscien's list of predatory journals and publishers. Kscien has recruited a special committee consisting of 23 young researchers. They are working unceasingly to keep the list refurbished, expose current tricks invented by the predators and guide authors. The list is designed to be updated daily. Currently, the criteria used to recognize predatory journals and publishers basically depend on the journal's misconduct, fabrication and inadequate peer review. Researches are ongoing to recapitulate more solid criteria with objective evidence to overcome the critics faced by Beall. Kscien's list has been proposed to replace the vanished Beall's list from the interior of the drawn region in fake journals and publishers. Highlights:

AB  - This paper extends the scholarship on gender and scientific authorship by exploring women's involvement in editorial decision-making. Prior to 1945, women scientists could submit their work to the journals of the Royal Society, but they were excluded from all editorial and evaluation roles: such gate-keeping roles were reserved for Fellows of the Society. We draw upon the Society's archive to examine the experiences of female authors, referees, and communicators in the period after women were admitted to the Fellowship. We investigate the involvement of women in both anonymous roles (e.g. as referees), and in publicly visible positions of editorial responsibility (e.g. as communicators, and committee chairs). We reveal that women were better represented in both types of roles in the 1950s than in the 1970s and 1980s. These findings are pertinent to current debates about bias in the peer-review system, and the gendering of academic reward and recognition structures.

AB  - It is widely known now that scholarly communication is in crisis, resting on an academic publishing model that is unsustainable. One response to this crisis has been the emergence of Open Access (OA) publishing, bringing scholarly literature out from behind a paywall and making it freely available to anyone online. Many research and academic libraries are facilitating the change to OA by establishing institutional repositories, supporting OA policies, and hosting OA journals. In addition, research funding bodies, such as the Australian Research Council (ARC), are mandating that all published grant research outputs be made available in OA, unless legal and contractual obligations prevent this. Despite these broader changes, not all scholars are aware of the new publishing environment. In particular, the rate of adoption of OA models in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) has historically been lower than Science, Technology and Medicine (STM) disciplines. Nevertheless, some local and international OA exemplars exist in HSS. At Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, the faculty-administered environmental humanities journal, Landscapes, was migrated to the institutional open access repository in 2013. Subsequently, researchers in the Faculty of Education and Arts were surveyed regarding their knowledge, understandings, and perceptions of OA publishing. The survey was also designed to elicit the barriers to OA publishing perceived or experienced by HSS researchers. This article will present the findings of our small faculty-based OA survey, with particular attention to HSS academics (and within this subject group, particular attention to the arts and humanities), their perceptions of OA, and the impediments they encounter. We argue that OA publishing will continue to transform scholarship within the arts and humanities, especially through the role of institutional repositories. The “library-as-publisher” role offers the potential to transform academic and university-specific publishing activities. However, the ongoing training of university researchers and personnel is required to bring into balance their understandings of OA publisher and the demands of the broader Australian and international research environment.

AB  - This review article presents the latest trends in innovative global scholarly journal publication and distribution platforms, with implications for local journals.Changes have taken place in distribution policies, as pre-publication distribution has become a viable option, and for post-publication distribution, public access or mandatory open access policies have been introduced for articles supported by public or governmental funds.New formats of articles include graphical abstracts, interactive PDFs, the application of semantic enhancements, and the utilization of research data, social networking sites, such as Mendeley and ResearchGate, have become common sites for information exchange.Altmetrics have been adopted to complement traditional journal metrics.PubMed Central, F1000Research, Kore-aMed Synapse, and ScienceCentral have been introduced as innovative full-text scholarly journal distribution systems.To publish web-based scholarly journals, it is necessary to adopt an open platform and to explore options such as an author profile database, an online collaborative editing module, and Crossref text and data mining services.To maximize the influence of local journals, it is necessary to integrate various external tools, such as researcher ID, research data, social media, and altmetrics services.

AB  - Scholarly PublishingHow do we gauge the importance of a scientific publication? Citation counts are, by their nature, crowdsourced, but their inherent meaning is somewhat unclear. To explore this question in more depth, Borchardt et al. asked chemists in a survey to look back at a 10-year-old issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society ( JACS ) and predict, without checking, which three papers had been most highly cited. Respondents were also asked which papers they construed as most important and which they would share with other chemists or the public more broadly. Citations not only proved rather hard to predict, but also correlated poorly with the papers chosen to share.PLOS ONE 13 , e0194903 (2018).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to better understand the theory and practice of peer review in open-access mega-journals (OAMJs). OAMJs typically operate a “soundness-only” review policy aiming to evaluate only the rigour of an article, not the novelty or significance of the research or its relevance to a particular community, with these elements being left for “the community to decide” post-publication. Design/methodology/approach The paper reports the results of interviews with 31 senior publishers and editors representing 16 different organisations, including 10 that publish an OAMJ. Thematic analysis was carried out on the data and an analytical model developed to explicate their significance. Findings Findings suggest that in reality criteria beyond technical or scientific soundness can and do influence editorial decisions. Deviations from the original OAMJ model are both publisher supported (in the form of requirements for an article to be “worthy” of publication) and practice driven (in the form of some reviewers and editors applying traditional peer review criteria to OAMJ submissions). Also publishers believe post-publication evaluation of novelty, significance and relevance remains problematic. Originality/value The study is based on unprecedented access to senior publishers and editors, allowing insight into their strategic and operational priorities. The paper is the first to report in-depth qualitative data relating specifically to soundness-only peer review for OAMJs, shedding new light on the OAMJ phenomenon and helping inform discussion on its future role in scholarly communication. The paper proposes a new model for understanding the OAMJ approach to quality assurance, and how it is different from traditional peer review.

AB  - As main buyers of scholarly literature, research libraries have always provided essential economic support for sustaining the market of academic publishing. With the switch to open access (OA), libraries are now faced with transitioning this support from the demand (subscriptions) to the supply (publications) side. The way in which this is currently done, in general, risks strengthening the preponderance of the for-profit approach to scholarly communication. We therefore believe that it is essential to apply library budgets to foster a greater diversity. That is exactly the purpose of the Fund for Fair Open Access, set up by KU Leuven Libraries in 2018, which is exclusively devoted to stimulating the development of non-profit and community-led initiatives. This is achieved by library memberships to sustain open scholarship infrastructure, by supporting diamond OA programmes and by subsidizing OA books published by Leuven University Press. In this article, we will demonstrate the accomplished successes of the fund and share some insights we have gathered along the way, such as our decision to cease financing article processing charges, even in a Fair OA business model.

AB  - Abstract&#x0D; Objective – This study analyzes scholarly publications supported by library open access funds, including author demographics, journal trends, and article impact. It also identifies and summarizes open access fund criteria and viability. The goal is to better understand the sustainability of open access funds, as well as identify potential best practices for institutions with open access funds.&#x0D; Methods – Publication data was solicited from universities with open access (OA) funds, and supplemented with publication and author metrics, including Journal Impact Factor, Altmetric Attention Score, and author h-index. Additionally, data was collected from OA fund websites, including fund criteria and guidelines.&#x0D; Results – Library OA funds tend to support faculty in science and medical fields. Impact varied widely, especially between disciplines, but a limited measurement indicated an overall smaller relative impact of publications funded by library OA funds. Many open access funds operate using similar criteria related to author and publication eligibility, which seem to be largely successful at avoiding the funding of articles published in predatory journals.&#x0D; Conclusions – Libraries have successfully funded many publications using criteria that could constitute best practices in this area. However, institutions with OA funds may need to identify opportunities to increase support for high-impact publications, as well as consider the financial stability of these funds. Alternative models for OA support are discussed in the context of an ever-changing open access landscape.

AB  - Abstract Lists of endorsed and discouraged scholarly publications recently emerged as an important transition in Chinese journal evaluation. Among the targeted users of these lists are researchers, who are to avoid publishing in discouraged journals and focus efforts on endorsed journals. However, it is unclear how these lists affect researchers’ valuations when choosing publication outlets. This explorative study investigates the reception of such journal lists in Chinese scientists’ research practices. Our findings suggest that three logics interact in respondents’ journal valuations: institutional evaluation regimes, differing epistemic cultures, and the influence of the commercial publishing industry. The reactive effects of both endorsed and discouraged journal lists appear to differ with the ranking status of universities, the seniority of scholars, and research fields. Apart from the new institutional evaluation regimes in this interplay, there appear to be more predominant factors than journal lists that inform publishing choices: quantitative indicators, publishers’ branding, epistemic cultures, and editorial procedures and publishing models.

AB  - When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind" Lord Kelvin, 1883 [1].Science is all about quantification.It is therefore somewhat ironic that the mechanism by which science is disseminatedacademic publishinghas yet to develop an acceptable way of measuring itself.Several fundamental issues regarding the scholarly publishing enterprise remain largely unresolved, such as how journal performance should be assessed, how journals should be compared and ranked, and how the impact of individual manuscripts should be evaluated.These issues are of relevance not only to journal editors and publishers, but also to librarians, who need to decide which journals to purchase, to researchers, who need to decide which journals to select for submission to, and to clinicians, who need to decide which journals they should read.By far the most widely used measure of journal performance is the Impact Factor, first developed by Eugene Garfield in 1955 as a means of selecting which journals to include in the Science Citations Index [2-4].The Impact Factor represents the average number of citations received per paper published in that journal during the two preceding years.For example, the Impact Factor of a journal in 2011 is calculated as follows

C1  - University of Ottawa
AB  - At the University of Ottawa, Canada, the UO Press and the UO Library have developed a strategic partnership to publish and disseminate selected new monographs as gold open access (OA). Starting in 2013, the Library agreed to fund three books at C$10,000 per book (a total of C$30,000 per year) in order to remove barriers to accessing scholarship and to align with scholarly communication goals of the University. In 2015 this agreement was renewed for another three years and the funding was increased to cover four books (a total of C$40,000 per year). Ten titles have so far been published under this model. The data reveals that there have been 12,629 downloads as well as 16,584 page views of these titles, as of September 2015. There have been over 4,700 copies (print and EPUB) sold in spite of the free availability of the PDF version. This program has been very successful in terms of increasing the visibility and impact of the Press’s publications; in providing unrestricted access to new scholarly research; and also in providing a significant source of revenue for the Press. The goals, process and outcomes are described in the context of the UO Press and the UO Library.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of one of the most important and controversial areas of scholarly communication: Open Access publishing and dissemination of research outputs. It identifies and discusses recent trends and future challenges for various stakeholders in delivering Open Access (OA) to the scholarly literature. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on a number of interrelated strands of evidence which make up the current discourse on OA, comprising the peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and other forms of communication (including blogs and e-mail discussion lists). It uses a large-scale textual analysis of the peer-reviewed literature since 2010 (carried out using the VOSviewer tool) as a basis for discussion of issues raised in the OA discourse. Findings – A number of key themes are identified, including the relationship between “Green” OA (deposit in repositories) and “Gold” OA (OA journal publication), the developing evidence base associated with OA, researcher attitudes and behaviours, policy directions, management of repositories, development of journals, institutional responses and issues around impact and scholarly communication futures. It suggests that current challenges now focus on how OA can be made to work in practice, having moved on from the discussion of whether it should happen at all. Originality/value – The paper provides a structured evidence-based review of major issues in the OA field, and suggests key areas for future research and policy development.

AB  - As open access gains a strong foothold in medical publishing, social science scholars increasingly are looking for outlets to make their own research open access. In STM, publication fees of the major open access journals start at $1,350, with payment often covered as part of grants received from pharmaceutical companies, government, and other organized entities. In contrast, limited grant funding in the social sciences doesn’t typically include publication support, so the question remains, “How can the open access model work for the social sciences?” This moderated panel discussion included representatives from libraries, university administration, and publishers to gain a full view of the current open access funding and publishing landscape and what might lie ahead. The conversation particularly focused on the librarian’s role in facilitating the open access funding and publishing processes and how the role of a social science librarian may change in an open access world.

AB  - Abstract To manage the transition to the open access (OA) model of scholarly publishing, we need to understand better what enables, encourages and inhibits the adoption of OA publishing among scientists, and to appreciate individual differences within disciplines. The study adopts a psychological perspective to elucidate motivations, capabilities and opportunities for OA publishing among bioscientists in the UK. To identify differences within the discipline, bioscientists with starkly different past practices for disclosing research data and technologies were interviewed. The sampled bioscientists face similar obstacles and enablers in their physical environment, but that their motivations and experience of their social environments differ. One group is strongly motivated by their moral convictions and beliefs in benefits of OA and feels peer pressure related to OA. The other group expresses fewer pro-OA beliefs, holds beliefs demotivating OA publishing, but feels pressure from research funders to adopt it. The former group makes more frequent use of OA publishing, which suggests that only those with strong motivations will work to overcome the social and physical obstacles. The individual differences within the discipline suggest that bioscientists are unlikely to respond to OA policies in the same way and, thus, the appropriateness of one-size-fits-all OA policies is questioned.

AB  - The issue this article aims to address is the fact that publications may nowadays be used to assess impact and quality of research in ways academics may not be fully aware of. During recent years, scholarly publications have gained in importance, not primarily as the traditional vehicle for the dissemination of new scientific findings, but as a foundation for assessing the production and impact of organizations, research groups and individual researchers. This means that publications as artefacts per se are starting to play a new important role in the scientific community and that researchers need to be aware of how publication and citation counts are being used to assess their research and the outreach, impact and reputation of their mother organization. University rankings, for instance, often have some parameters based on the publishing of the ranked institution. This article is thus not about scientific writing as such; it focuses on what happens to your publication after the publishing has taken place and on aspects to take into account while planning the publishing of your article, report or book.

AB  - This study analyzes the implementation of open science in Spanish universities considering four perspectives: (i) regulations, policies, and strategies; (ii) knowledge production; (iii) research results; and (iv) perception by different academic actors. A qualitative and quantitative methodology is applied, drawing information from university websites, institutional reports, European project databases (Cordis), the Web of Science database, surveys of teaching and research staff, and surveys of vice-rectors and library directors. The information is grouped into regional university systems, according to the autonomous community to which each university belongs, and is analyzed on that basis. The results of the quantitative study show increasing interest in open-science activities, expressed as a growing number of publications, and an increase in participation, leadership, and funding in European projects. Institutional policies and regulations on open science, on the other hand, are few and focus almost exclusively on open access. The development of institutional repositories is one of the great achievements of the Spanish university system, and open-access publishing (mainly green open access) has grown considerably in the last decade. Teaching and research staff are not knowledgeable about open science, although in general they take a positive view toward it, while university policymakers report that most actions to promote open science are still in the process of being implemented. The results reveal heterogeneity among the various institutions’ practices and implementation. As a regional system, the Catalonian university system stands out above the rest for its degree of open-science policy development and implementation and for its intense research activity in the field of open science.

AB  - Nearly ten years ago, scholarly publishing came to the fore in research on scientific communication spurred by the evolving Open Science system, the reinvention of peer reviews, and new attitudes to scholarly publications in the ranking-based academic environment. Here, the JLE editors revisit the field of scholarly publishing and identify the most popular areas where potential JLE authors might have difficulty. In this editorial, Scopus-indexed reviews are analysed to map the prevailing trends. The editorial review shows that the trends include open access, peer review transparency, the changing role of libraries in scholarly publishing, CrossRef’s initiatives, outsourcing and skills lacking in publishing, the impact of universities’ prescribed lists for publishing research, open-access monographs, and the role of commercial publishers.

AB  - Abstract In the current scientific and political discourse surrounding the transformation of the scientific publication system, significant attention is focused on Diamond Open Access (OA). Diamond OA is characterized by no charges for readers or authors and relies on monetary allowances and voluntary work. This article explores the potential and challenges of Diamond OA journals, using Germany as a case study. Two key questions are addressed: first, the current role of such journals in the scientific publication system is determined through bibliometric analysis across various disciplines. Second, an investigation is conducted to assess the sustainability of Diamond OA journals and identify associated structural problems or potential breaking points. This investigation includes an in-depth expert interview study involving 20 editors of Diamond OA journals. The empirical results are presented using a landscape map that considers two dimensions: 'monetized and gift-based completion of tasks' and 'journal team size.' The bibliometric analysis reveals a substantial number of Diamond OA journals in the social sciences and humanities, but limited adoption in other fields. The model proves effective for small to mid-sized journals, but not for larger ones. Additionally, it was found that 23 Diamond OA journals have recently discontinued their operations. The expert interviews demonstrate the diversity within the landscape and the usefulness of the two dimensions in understanding key differences. Journals in two of the four quadrants of the map exemplify sustainable conditions, while the other two quadrants raise concerns about long-term stability. These concerns include limited funding leading to a lack of division of labor and an excessive burden on highly committed members. Gift-like contributions, while appealing, also present challenges as potential donors not only decide whether to contribute but also how to contribute, potentially creating friction between the gift and the journal's requirements. Furthermore, journals in the lower right quadrant often rely on third-party funding, necessitating a transformation once the funding expires. Common pathways for sustaining operations include lobbying for funding at the journal's home institution or increasing reliance on gift-based completion of tasks. These findings underscore the need for the development of more sustainable funding models to ensure the success of Diamond OA journals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION In the last decade, a significant number of institutions have adopted open access (OA) policies. Many of those working with OA policies are tasked with measuring policy compliance. This article reports on a survey of Coalition of Open Access Policy Institutions (COAPI) members designed to better understand the methods currently used for measuring and communicating OA policy success. METHODS This electronic survey was distributed to the COAPI member listserv, inviting both institutions who have passed an implemented policies and those who are still developing policies to participate. RESULTS The results to a number of questions related to topics such as policy workflows, quantitative and qualitative measurement activities and related tools, and challenges showed a wide range of responses, which are shared here. DISCUSSION It is clear that a number of COAPI members struggle with identifying what should be measured and what tools and methods are appropriate. The survey illustrates how each institution measures compliance differently, making it difficult to benchmark against peer institutions. CONCLUSION As a result of this survey, we recommend that institutions working with OA policies be as transparent as possible about their data sources and methods when calculating deposit rates and other quantitative measures. It is hoped that this transparency will result in the development of a set of qualitative and quantitative best practices for assessing OA policies that standardizes assessment terminology and articulates why institutions may want to measure policies.

AB  - In this editorial, we will introduce the contributions to the Special Issue entitled “Measuring Open Access Uptake: Databases, Metrics, and International Comparisons.” The contributions to this Special Issue explore the methods and metrics that are used to assess open access (OA) uptake across disciplines and regions, a crucial topic considering the growing push by several research institutions worldwide to achieve 100% OA. We will discuss the impact of OA on scholarly publishing, focusing on how economic factors and discipline-specific practices shape its adoption. Additionally, we will examine the transformation of OA models, the citation benefits of a hybrid OA model, and regional perspectives. Our analysis identifies key challenges and disparities in OA adoption and suggests future directions for achieving sustainable and equitable access to research.

AB  - This study assesses the extent and nature of open access scholarly publishing in Brazil, one of the world’s leaders in providing universal access to its research and scholarship. It utilizes Brazil’s Qualis journal evaluation system, along with other relevant data bases to address the association between scholarly quality and open access in the Brazilian context. Through cross tabulation among these various data sets, it is possible to arrive at a reasonably accurate picture of journals, systems, ratings, and disciplines. The study establishes reliable measures and counts of Brazilian scholarly publications, the proportion and types of open access, and journals ratings and by disciplinary field. It finds that the better the Brazilian journal, the more likely it is to be open access. It also finds that Qualis ranks Brazilian journals lower overall than the international journals in which Brazilian authors publish, most notably in the field of the biological sciences. The study concludes with a consideration of the policy implications for building on the country’s global leadership in open access to strengthen the quality of its global contribution to knowledge.

AB  - Objective – This paper explores how to utilize two well-known library databases, Thomson Reuter’s Web of Science and Elsevier’s Scopus, to quantify Long Island educational institutions’ scholarly productivity.&#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – Institutions located in the Long Island region and within Nassau and Suffolk counties, including the State University of New York (SUNY) colleges, private institutions, and technical schools, were examined for the last 14 years (2000–2013). Eight Long Island institutions were represented in both databases and were included in the study.&#x0D; &#x0D; Results – Of the eight institutions, Stony Brook University produced the most publications indexed in Web of Science and Scopus during the period of 2000–2013. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory yielded the second most publications during 2000–2013 in both Web of Science and Scopus, but it produced the highest quality publications compared with other institutions excluding Stony Brook University. Although the annual growth rates of Farmingdale State College and New York Institute of Technology increased dramatically in both Web of Science and Scopus, the large proportional increase did not represent a large increase in total value. Additionally, some institutions had a higher number of publications indexed in Web of Science than in Scopus, and others had a higher number of publications indexed in Scopus than in Web of Science.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusions – Data were collected from institutions in Long Island with various institutional sizes, the number of faculty members employed may have made an impact on the number of publications. Thus, publication data in this study cannot be used to compare their rankings. Institutions with a similar type and similar size of faculty members should be selected for comparison. Due to the different coverage and scope of Web of Science and Scopus, institutions should use both databases to examine their scholarly output. Furthermore, institutions should consider using altmetrics to capture various impacts of the scholarly output to complement the traditional metrics.

AB  - Qualitative scientific journals play a vital role in scholarly communication processes. However, during the last few years, there is a mushroom growth of journals in every discipline in India. There has been no single source of systematic advice on how to measure the scientific value of Indian journals. The present study is an attempt to minimize the gap by developing a mechanism for measuring scientific value of Indian journals. Consulting various international databases and their journal inclusion policy, a viable mechanism has been devised and tested with 100+ Indian journals in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology. The results indicate that although the quantity of yearly additions of new journals in each of the three disciplines is quite impressive, the yearly discontinuation is also alarming. Almost 29% of physics journals, 11% of chemistry journals and 21% of biology journals were stopped within a year. Although irregularity in publication, improper execution of review process, non-disclosure of article processing charges, lower percentage of foreign contributors and low citation rate were identified as some drawbacks with Indian physics, chemistry and biology journals. The percentage of predatory journals in these three disciplines is quite less till date. In order to choose a better platform of scholarly publishing, this study suggests some recommendations for prospective authors.

AB  - For two decades, open access (OA) has gained momentum worldwide. However, adoption of OA in Canada is lagging compared with other countries. Using data from Dimensions and Érudit, this paper provides an overview of OA dissemination in Canada, focusing on the effect of institutions, language, and funding. Papers in French, and from Quebec universities, are more likely to be OA, while papers from engineering-oriented institutions are less likely to be OA. Regarding funders, those in health sciences have higher OA compliance. The paper concludes discussing disciplinary differences in OA dissemination, low compliance to OA mandates in Canada, and the role of Érudit.

AB  - Open access institutional repositories were created to promote access to information, encourage scholarly communication, and demonstrate institutional prestige. While these repositories have been widely adopted, the quality of their contents often fails to represent their institution's scholarly output. Moreover, current research uses measurements of quantity, not quality, to assess their value. In response, this article opens new areas of scholarly inquiry by assessing the quality of contents. This is accomplished through a cross-sectional study of repositories at American colleges and universities across the academic spectrum, using citation indexing to identify an institution's articles and authors of highest impact.

AB  - How common is self-citation in scholarly publication, and does the practice vary by gender? Using novel methods and a data set of 1.5 million research papers in the scholarly database JSTOR published between 1779 and 2011, the authors find that nearly 10 percent of references are self-citations by a paper’s authors. The findings also show that between 1779 and 2011, men cited their own papers 56 percent more than did women. In the last two decades of data, men self-cited 70 percent more than women. Women are also more than 10 percentage points more likely than men to not cite their own previous work at all. While these patterns could result from differences in the number of papers that men and women authors have published rather than gender-specific patterns of self-citation behavior, this gender gap in self-citation rates has remained stable over the last 50 years, despite increased representation of women in academia. The authors break down self-citation patterns by academic field and number of authors and comment on potential mechanisms behind these observations. These findings have important implications for scholarly visibility and cumulative advantage in academic careers.

AB  - Three years ago, the Gold and Green Roads to Open Access were viewed as complementary strategies, with repositories having the potential of gradually behaving more like journals, and vice versa. Since then, repositories and journals have been progressing on parallel tracks. Re-examining the situation, the reasoning suggested in 2004 appears still valid. Simultaneously, a knowledge economy has made of science a strategic resource. The developing world is essentially invited to contribute to world science with little or no regard to the development of an autonomous scientific capacity. Open Access, in this context, takes a new meaning with one objective to help development of local and autonomous scientific capacity. However, to do so, mixing and matching repositories with journals is needed. Brazil exemplifies this type of development and shows how the Green and Gold roads can mix and match.

AB  - As open access publishing has become more widespread and required by research funders and the research community, the management and monitoring of article processing charges (APCs) have emerged as an important task in research organisations around the world. Within this tendency, a question of the comprehensiveness of organisational APC monitoring has become relevant. This case study demonstrates how the comprehensiveness of in-house APC monitoring can be evaluated using international bibliographic information sources like Web of Science and Scopus, where it is possible to identify the corresponding author, as well as Unpaywall and DOAJ, which contain information about the open access statuses and APCs of articles. Based on study results, it can be assumed that the organisation’s in-house bookkeeping has succeeded in registering 52 percent of APC invoices while 48 percent have not been identified. The results show that the number of unreported publications that have been openly published and whose corresponding author is affiliated with the university is almost equal to those registered in the university’s institutional APC report. The study describes the stages of data collection and processing in order of implementation, which allows a similar review to be feasible in another organisation. At the end of the article, development proposals are presented for both the organisations’ in-house data collection and the content of publishers’ invoices.

AB  - The number of scholarly journal articles published each year is growing, but little is known about the relationship between journal article growth and other forms of scholarly dissemination (e.g., books and monographs). Journal articles are the de facto currency of evaluation and prestige in STEM fields, but social scientists routinely publish books as well as articles, representing a unique opportunity to study increased article publications in disciplines with other dissemination options. We studied the publishing activity of social science faculty members in 12 disciplines at 290 Ph.D. granting institutions in the United States between 2011 and 2019, asking: 1) have publication practices changed such that more or fewer books and articles are written now than in the recent past?; 2) has the percentage of scholars actively participating in a particular publishing type changed over time?; and 3) do different age cohorts evince different publication strategies? In all disciplines, journal articles per person increased between 3% and 64% between 2011 and 2019, while books per person decreased by at least 31% and as much as 54%. All age cohorts show increased article authorship over the study period, and early career scholars author more articles per person than the other cohorts in eight disciplines. The article-dominated literatures of the social sciences are becoming increasingly similar to those of STEM disciplines.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Internet and the rise of e‐Science alter the conditions for scholarly communication. In signing declarations against open access mandates, society publishers indicate that they feel most threatened by the emergence of institutional repositories and the self‐archiving mandates that these make possible. More attention should be paid to the impact of e‐Science, the rise of Internet‐based guild publishers, and the entrance of players from the new economy. Society journals should stop aspiring to such functions as registration and archiving and should shed electronic dissemination, while enhancing certification and investing in (new) navigation services.

TI  - Moving peer review transparency from process to praxis
VL  - 32
AU  - Ford, Emily

AB  - Scholarly publications often work to provide transparency of peer-review processes, posting policy information to their websites as suggested by the Committee on Publication Ethics' (COPE) Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Publishing. Yet this falls short in providing peer-review transparency. Using examples from an interview-based qualitative study, this article argues that scholarly publications should move from peer-review process transparency to a praxis of transparency in peer review. Praxis infers that values inform practices. Scholarly publications should therefore use clear communication practices in all matters of business, and bolster transparency efforts, delineating rights and responsibilities of all players in peer review. Moreover, the scholarly publishing community should offer improved and society-led referee and editor training, rather than leaving the commercial publishing industry to fill the gap which results in peer review as a service to industry's needs – turning an efficient profit – and not the scholarly community's needs for human-to-human discourse.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This paper presents an overview of different kinds of lists of scholarly publication channels and of experiences related to the construction and maintenance of national lists supporting performance-based research funding systems. It also contributes with a set of recommendations for the construction and maintenance of national lists of journals and book publishers. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on analysis of previously published studies, policy papers, and reported experiences related to the construction and use of lists of scholarly publication channels. Findings Several countries have systems for research funding and/or evaluation, that involve the use of national lists of scholarly publication channels (mainly journals and publishers). Typically, such lists are selective (do not include all scholarly or non-scholarly channels) and differentiated (distinguish between channels of different levels and quality). At the same time, most lists are embedded in a system that encompasses multiple or all disciplines. This raises the question how such lists can be organized and maintained to ensure that all relevant disciplines and all types of research are adequately represented. Research limitation The conclusions and recommendations of the study are based on the authors’ interpretation of a complex and sometimes controversial process with many different stakeholders involved. Practical implications The recommendations and the related background information provided in this paper enable mutual learning that may feed into improvements in the construction and maintenance of national and other lists of scholarly publication channels in any geographical context. This may foster a development of responsible evaluation practices. Originality/value This paper presents the first general overview and typology of different kinds of publication channel lists, provides insights on expert-based versus metrics-based evaluation, and formulates a set of recommendations for the responsible construction and maintenance of publication channel lists.

TI  - Navigating the Digital Divide: Challenges and Opportunities in Research Publishing for African Scholars
AU  - Aldirdiri, Osman
C1  - Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan
AB  - From ancient times, African civilization has participated in knowledge production and dissemination. The nature of research production and publishing in Africa varied throughout the years according to the influences and infrastructures present at each point in time. The colonization era was a landmark in the evolution of research practice and research publishing in Africa. It had consequences that lasted long after independence and contributed to the underdevelopment of research production and publishing systems in Africa. Currently, Africa is lagging behind in terms of its contribution to global research. An increase in African research output and an improvement of its visibility are needed. The digitization of research publishing holds great opportunities for the enhancement of scholarly publishing systems in Africa, yet it is faced with challenges. This article identifies the major challenges faced by governments, institutions, and scholars in digitizing research publishing in Africa. These challenges include limited funding, poor infrastructures, low research output, language barriers, difficulties in establishing quality assurance, copyright issues, data-management issues, and lack of policies and regulations. Addressing these challenges in local contexts is necessary to enhance digital research publishing in Africa.

AU  - do Amaral, Janaynne
AB  - Exalted by some people and criticized by others, since the peer review system has been implemented in scholarly journals it has transformed into an effective tool to select manuscripts of scientific merit for publication. Henry Oldenburg, the first Secretary of the Royal Society and creator of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (founded 1665), was one of the pioneers in implementing peer review in scientific journals. He started the peer-review system in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society by inviting 3 members of the Royal Society “who had more knowledge of the matters in question than he, to comment on submissions prior to making the decision about whether to publish.”1 At that time, the development of the peer-review system was linked to the concerns of scientists as science producers and consumers.2 As science producers, they wanted to have their work recognized by publishing in spaces valued by other members of the scientific community. As science consumers, they wanted to make sure that the studies elaborated by other scientists were evaluated with competence.2 The decisions taken by Oldenburg and the Council of the Royal Society to evaluate the quality of the content published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society constituted the foundations of peer review.2 Throughout the history of scholarly publishing, the peer-review process has typically been done by a small community of peers. These peers are defined in literature as “experienced researchers”3 and selected by the editors based on criteria such as academic seniority, academic degree, involvement […]

AB  - This study identified nearly 700 English-language refereed journals in education and psychology that were founded in 2000–2009. Part one discusses the publishers, format, open-access availability, and current status of these publications. Titles were then searched against coverage lists of EBSCO Academic Search Complete, Gale Academic OneFile, ProQuest Central, ERIC, PsycINFO, Web of Science, DOAJ, Google Scholar, WorldCAT, and the library catalogs of the “Big Ten” universities to determine whether databases and libraries include these new publications. Subscription database coverage was poor, ranging from 8.8 percent (ProQuest Central) to 42.0 percent (PsycINFO). Psychology materials were heavily favored over education items in several databases. Although some library catalogs provide better title-level coverage, they are unable to search individual articles. Google Scholar only indexed the publishers’ versions of the journals in 143 (58.0%) of 247 cases examined. Significant differences in database coverage and library holdings were found when comparing publications of major corporations (Elsevier, Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis, Sage, Springer, and Wiley) against periodicals produced by smaller companies, colleges/universities, and scholarly/professional organizations. This article also describes a “ubiquity index” devised by the author to identify approximately 70 “journals of the decade” based on database coverage and library holdings. The study provides much cause for concern about the comprehensiveness and currency of existing discovery tools. It also offers evidence that the relationship between libraries and publishing conglomerates deserves further examination.

AB  - Altmetrics were born from a desire to see and measure research impact differently. Complementing traditional citation analysis, altmetrics are intended to reflect more broad views of research impact by taking into account the use of digital scholarly communication tools. Aggregating online attention paid to individual scholarly articles and data sets is the approach taken by Altmetric LLP, an altmetrics tool provider. Potential uses for article-level metrics collected by Altmetric include: 1) the assessment of an article's impact within a particular community, 2) the assessment of the overall impact of a body of scholarly work, and 3) the characterization of entire author and reader communities that engage with particular articles online. Although attention metrics are still being refined, qualitative altmetrics data are beginning to illustrate the rich new world of scholarly communication, and are emerging as ways to highlight the immediate societal impacts of research.

AB  - The motivations for an author to choose a journal to submit to are complex and include factors relating to impact and prestige, service quality, and publication costs and policies. Authors require information about multiple characteristics of journals that may be difficult to obtain. This article compares and contrasts the new author‐oriented journal comparison tools and services that have emerged to assist researchers in this important step of the scholarly publishing process. Many of these tools combine factors to provide full web‐based manuscript submission decision tools; however, they all have limitations that reduce their usefulness.

AB  - It has become a common trend among academic professionals to check listing/ranking of academic journals in recognized journal ranking/quality lists before submitting their articles for review and possible publication.In addition, professional research evaluation committees in universities often consult many quality journals ranking lists.Although a majority of scholars/institutions consider forprofit indexing/abstracting databases like SSCI, SCI, Scopus, IBSS, PsycINFO etc. to assess quality of journals, this article focuses on the not-for-profit academic journal quality/ranking lists developed by various institutions or governments.This editorial presents a review of select journal quality lists produced by not-for-profit organizations because academic products developed by for-profit companies always reflect some degree of bias (Krimsky, 2013).Therefore, the lists/rankings like Clarivate Analytics (formerly Thomson Reuters) journal ranking, Cabell's journals list, SCImago journal ranking (although it is free but it harvests data from for-profit database Scopus) will be excluded.There are various academic journal ranking lists available in the market.For instance, Google Scholar provides a free list of top 100 multidisciplinary publications (Google Scholar, n.d.).This list is based on h5-index.Publications having higher h5-index are ranked higher.This list may be useful for scholars but has a very limited scope because it is not possible for every research scholar to publish in these top 100 publications.Secondly, this list excludes (or journals in these areas may not have reached to the desired h5-index value) many science and art areas for example, fine arts, music, astronomy, business, management etc.Similarly, Financial Times (FT) also calculates academic journal rankings and provides a list of top 50 academic journals for free (Ormans, 2016).Again, the scope of this list is limited because it only provides 50 journals in the areas of management and business.Hence, FT journal list is not very useful for scholars from other academic disciplines just like

AB  - This paper reports a survey on citation behaviour of Malaysian researchers. It is part of a wider study gauging quality and trustworthiness in scholarly communication in the emerging digital environment. The survey questionnaire was distributed between 1 October 2014 and 31 January 2015. A total of 391 respondents, from four research areas (humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences) completed the questionnaire. The finding indicated that motivations for citing were complex and multi‐faceted, but in all four disciplines, researchers cite a work because they regard it as an authoritative and trustworthy source, which provides a context or building block to their own research. Although researchers have moved from a print‐based system to a digital one, it has not significantly changed the way they decide what to trust. Peer reviewed journals are still the most influential. Open access journals will be cited if they have been peer reviewed. Citing on the basis of high altmetrics and other social judgements, such as mentions, likes, and use, was not prevalent. Measures of establishing trust and authority do not seem to have changed profoundly in Malaysia.

AB  - Although institutional affiliation is not mandatory in scholarly publishing, a new trend of multiple and simultaneous affiliations, which I will call “octopus affiliations” or “octaffiliations” in short, is increasingly noticeable as a distorted consequence of academic ranking and evaluation systems. Institutions offer financial and/or technical supports to authors whose contributions are, in turn, used as a hallmark of productivity, influence, visibility and reputation of their affiliations at national and international levels. While it is understandable that an author can be affiliated with one or two institutions at a time, multiple and simultaneous affiliations, on the other hand, would be hardly realistic.

AB  - Abstract This article presents the results of the Latin American Observatory of eVAluation Indicators (OLIVA, its Spanish acronym) which aims to contribute to the visibility of indexed scientific output in Latin America and the Caribbean and enhance its value in evaluation systems. This study addresses the production published in open access by journals indexed in SciELO and Redalyc, based on a single database of a total of 1,720 journals (from 15 countries), 908,982 documents and 2,591,704 authors. It also highlights its disciplinary diversity, and trends in national and international research collaboration. Finally, only for the case of Brazil and SciELO, intranational collaboration is analyzed. The study concludes that there is a predominance of diamond journals, of university publishing institutions and of multiscalar forms of circulation. These characteristics, even with linguistic and disciplinary diversity, can contribute very effectively to the current needs of science communication in times of open science.

AB  - We studied journal articles published by researchers at all eight New Zealand universities in 2017 to determine how many were freely accessible on the web. We wrote software code to harvest data from multiple sources, code that we now share to enable others to reproduce our work on their own sample set. In May 2019, we ran our code to determine which of the 2017 articles were open at that time and by what method; where those articles would have incurred an Article Processing Charge (APC) we calculated the cost if those charges had been paid. Where articles were not freely available we determined whether the policies of publishers in each case would have allowed deposit in a non-commercial repository (Green open access). We also examined citation rates for different types of access. We found that, of our 2017 sample set, about two out of every five articles were freely accessible without payment or subscription (41%). Where research was explicitly said to be funded by New Zealand’s major research funding agencies, the proportion was slightly higher at 45%. Where open articles would have incurred an APC we estimated an average cost per article of USD1,682 (for publications where all articles require an APC, that is, Gold open access) and USD2,558 (where APC payment is optional, Hybrid open access) at a total estimated cost of USD1.45m. Of the paid options, Gold is by far more common for New Zealand researchers (82% Gold, 18% Hybrid). In terms of citations, our analysis aligned with previous studies that suggest a correlation between publications being freely accessible and, on balance, slightly higher rates of citation. This is not seen across all types of open access, however, with Diamond OA achieving the lowest rates. Where articles were not freely accessible we found that a very large majority of them (88% or 3089 publications) could have been legally deposited in an institutional repository. Similarly, only in a very small number of cases had a version deposited in the repository of a New Zealand university made the difference between the publication being freely accessible or not (125 publications). Given that most New Zealand researchers support research being open, there is clearly a large gap between belief and practice in New Zealand’s research ecosystem.

AB  - Amidst the ever-expanding realm of scientific production and the proliferation of predatory journals, the focus on peer review remains paramount for scientometricians and sociologists of science. Despite this attention, there is a notable scarcity of empirical investigations into the tangible impact of peer review on publication quality. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of how peer review contributes to the quality of scholarly publications, as measured by the citations they receive.Utilizing an adjusted dataset comprising 57,482 publications from Publons to Web of Science and employing the Raking Ratio method, our study reveals intriguing insights. Specifically, our findings shed light on a nuanced relationship between the length of reviewer reports and the subsequent citations received by publications. Through a robust regression analysis, we establish that, beginning from 947 words, the length of reviewer reports is significantly associated with an increase in citations.These results not only confirm the initial hypothesis that longer reports indicate requested improvements, thereby enhancing the quality and visibility of articles, but also underscore the importance of timely and comprehensive reviewer reports. Furthermore, insights from Publons' data suggest that open access to reports can influence reviewer behavior, encouraging more detailed reports.Beyond the scholarly landscape, our findings prompt a reevaluation of the role of reviewers, emphasizing the need to recognize and value this resource-intensive yet underappreciated activity in institutional evaluations. Additionally, the study sounds a cautionary note regarding the challenges faced by peer review in the context of an increasing volume of submissions, potentially compromising the vigilance of peers in swiftly assessing numerous articles.

AB  - Abstract The push to implement Open Access (OA) as the new standard for academic research dissemination is creating very real pressures on academic journals. In Canada, the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) recently adopted a policy requiring that journals applying for its Aid to Scholarly Journals (ASJ) grant make their scholarly content freely accessible after no more than a 12-month delay. For journals such as the Canadian Journal of Political Science ( CJPS ) that not only publish high-quality, peer-reviewed articles to a specialized audience but also support the work of scholarly associations through the revenues they generate, the push to move to OA comes with a number of challenges. The Canadian Political Science Association (CPSA) and the Société québécoise de science politique (SQSP) established a committee to chart the best course of action for the CJPS in light of this changing landscape. This article summarizes the key findings of the committee and underscores some of the challenges of OA for journals with a profile similar to the CJPS , as well as for the broader research ecosystem that they support.

AB  - The popularity of open access (OA) publications has increased in recent years. This situation leads to several pertinent questions for academic libraries: Is the rapid expansion of OA availability negatively affecting their COUNTER usage reports? And, as a consequence, is the increasing accessibility of OA publications prompting academic libraries to reconsider their subscriptions to traditional, subscription-based resources? The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of hybrid OA growth on Denison University’s subscribed e-resource usage and to illuminate the potential effects of OA on academic library subscriptions.

AB  - The open access movement in Canada is very active in many areas. This is not surprising; of the 16 people at the Budapest meeting which was the foundation of the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI), three were Canadians, all global leaders in this arena: Leslie Chan, Jean-Claude Guedon, and Stevan Harnad. The Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL) was among the earliest signatories of the BOAI, and quickly initiated a nationwide institutional repository program. The Canadian Library Association (CLA) recently approved an innovative “Position Statement on Open Access for Canadian Libraries,” calling for all libraries to participate in advocacy, educating patrons abut open access resources, and encouraging support for open access, including economic support. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has an open access mandate policy, requiring open access to CIHR-funded research within six months. The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) has an Aid to Open Access Journals program. Other funding agencies in Canada either have, or are developing, open access policies and support. This article presents an overview of CLA advocacy and open access in Canada, with a focus on initiatives with a strong library involvement or leadership.

AB  - This paper outlines the UK publishing landscape for the social and political sciences, with particular reference to academic journals. The changes and challenges being brought to this environment by open access (OA) are described and the response of UK publishers examined. While some of the initial caution among publishers towards OA in the social and political sciences is beginning to recede, the pressures of funding, perception and engagement remain considerable. Despite scepticism from some quarters about the future role of so-called 'legacy' publishers, it is argued that their skills, knowledge and innovation will make them a valuable part of the evolving, and ever more varied, scholarly communications arena.

AB  - The move from subscription only publishing of scholarly articles to open access has been much slower than previously anticipated by many Open Access (OA) advocates. Despite the many advantages that OA offers, this particular branch of E-commerce imposes several formidable barriers to change. A framework conceptualizing these barriers that was developed over a decade ago was revisited to see if the significance of these barriers has changed. Nowadays, building the IT infrastructure, support from indexing services and finding a sustainable business model are no longer important barriers. For gold OA publishing the academic reward system is still a major obstacle, whereas more marketing and critical mass is needed for both gold OA and green OA. Green OA self-archiving is still also strongly affected by what subscription publishers allow. In the overall balance the situation has nevertheless improved significantly.

AB  - As of May 2014, the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) listed close to ten thousand fully open access, peer reviewed, scholarly journals. Most of these journals do not charge article processing charges (APCs). This article reports the results of a survey of the 2567 journals, or 26% of journals listed in DOAJ, that do have APCs based on a sample of 1432 of these journals. Results indicate a volatile sector that would make future APCs difficult to predict for budgeting purposes. DOAJ and publisher title lists often did not closely match. A number of journals were found on examination not to have APCs. A wide range of publication costs was found for every publisher type. The average (mean) APC of $964 contrasts with a mode of $0. At least 61% of publishers using APCs are commercial in nature, while many publishers are of unknown types. The vast majority of journals charging APCs (80%) were found to offer one or more variations on pricing, such as discounts for authors from mid to low income countries, differential pricing based on article type, institutional or society membership, and/or optional charges for extras such as English language editing services or fast track of articles. The complexity and volatility of this publishing landscape is discussed.

AB  - This article documents Open access article processing charges (OA APC) longitudinal study 2015 preliminary dataset available for download from the OA APC dataverse [1]. This dataset was gathered as part of Sustaining the Knowledge Commons (SKC), a research program funded by Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. The overall goal of SKC is to advance our collective knowledge about how to transition scholarly publishing from a system dependent on subscriptions and purchase to one that is fully open access. The OA APC preliminary data 2015 Version 12 dataset was developed as one of the lines of research of SKC, a longitudinal study of the minority (about a third) of the fully open access journals that use this business model. The original idea was to gather data during an annual two-week census period. The volume of data and growth in this area makes this an impractical goal. For this reason, we are posting this preliminary dataset in case it might be helpful to others working in this area. Future data gathering and analyses will be conducted on an ongoing basis. We encourage others to share their data as well. In order to merge datasets, note that the two most critical elements for matching data and merging datasets are the journal title and ISSN.

AB  - A review of:&#x0D; &#x0D; Antelman, Kristin. “Do Open-Access Articles Have a Greater Research Impact?” College &amp; Research Libraries 65.5 (Sep. 2004): 372-82.&#x0D; &#x0D; Objective – To ascertain whether open access articles have a greater research impact than articles not freely available, as measured by citations in the ISI Web of Science database.&#x0D; &#x0D; Design – Analysis of mean citation rates of a sample population of journal articles across four disciplines.&#x0D; &#x0D; Setting – Journal literature across the disciplines of philosophy, political science, mathematics, and electrical and electronic engineering.&#x0D; &#x0D; Subjects – A sample of 2,017 articles across the four disciplines published between 2001 and 2002 (for political science, mathematics, and electrical and electronic engineering) and between 1999 and 2000 (for philosophy). &#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – A systematic presample of articles for each of the disciplines was taken to calculate the necessary sample sizes. Based on this calculation, articles were sourced from ten leading journals in each discipline. The leading journals in political science, mathematics, and electrical and electronic engineering were defined by ISI’s Journal Citation Reports for 2002. The ten leading philosophy journals were selected using a combination of other methods.&#x0D; &#x0D; Once the sample population had been identified, each article title and the number of citations to each article (in the ISI Web of Science database) were recorded. Then the article title was searched in Google and if any freely available full text version was found, the article was classified as open access. The mean citation rate for open access and non-open access articles in each discipline was identified, and the percentage difference between the means was calculated.&#x0D; &#x0D; Main results – The four disciplines represented a range of open access uptake: 17% of articles in philosophy were open access, 29% in political science, 37% in electrical and electronic engineering, and 69% in mathematics. There was a significant difference in the mean citation rates for open access articles and non-open access articles in all four disciplines. The percentage difference in means was 45% in philosophy, 51% in electrical and electronic engineering, 86% in political science, and 91% in mathematics. Mathematics had the highest rate of open access availability of articles, but political science had the greatest difference in mean citation rates, suggesting there are other, discipline-specific factors apart from rate of open access uptake affecting research impact.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion – The finding that, across these four disciplines, open access articles have a greater research impact than non-open access articles, is only one aspect of the complex changes that are presently taking place in scholarly publishing and communication. However, it is useful information for librarians formulating strategies for building institutional repositories, or exploring open access publishing with patrons or publishers.&#x0D;

AB  - The accumulation of evidence that open access publishing can increase citation rates highlights one benefit of universal accessibility to scholarly works. However, studies investigating the effect of open access publishing on citations are typically conducted across a wide variety of journals and disciplines, introducing a number of potential issues and limiting their utility for specific disciplines. Here, I used three primary marine ecology journals with an open access option as a “microcosm” of scientific publishing to determine whether or not open access articles received more citations than non-open access articles during the same time frame, controlling for self-citations, article type, and journal impact factor. I also tested for the effects of time since publication and the number of authors. Citations were positively correlated with time since publication and differed across the three journals. In addition, open access articles received significantly more citations than non-open access articles. Self-citations increased with author number and were affected by a complex interaction between open access, journal, and time since publication. This study demonstrates that open access articles receive more citations in hybrid marine ecology journals, although the causal factors driving this trend are unknown.

AB  - The open access movement has gained momentum since the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) first launched twenty years ago. Notably, there has been a drastic increase in the number of open access articles. Concerns have been raised about equality and diversity issues, however, for researchers without an affiliation (e.g. independent, unemployed and retired researchers) and researchers on the 'scientific periphery' who are excluded from the gold open access model. This article argues that the gold open access model is destructive to the knowledge production ecosystem by addressing the importance of bibliodiversity and the ways in which library publishing can contribute to sustainable and equitable knowledge production.

AB  - Open access (OA) has mostly been studied by relying on publication data from selective international databases, notably Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The aim of our study is to show that it is possible to achieve a national estimate of the number and share of OA based on institutional publication data providing a comprehensive coverage of the peer-reviewed outputs across fields, publication types, and languages. Our data consists of 48,177 journal, conference, and book publications from 14 Finnish universities in 2016–2017, including information about OA status, as self-reported by researchers and validated by data-collection personnel through their Current Research Information System (CRIS). We investigate the WoS, Scopus, and DOI coverage, as well as the share of OA outputs between different fields, publication types, languages, OA mechanisms (gold, hybrid, and green), and OA information sources (DOAJ, Bielefeld list, and Sherpa/Romeo). We also estimate the role of the largest international commercial publishers compared to the not-for-profit Finnish national publishers of journals and books. We conclude that institutional data, integrated at national and international level, provides one of the building blocks of a large-scale data infrastructure needed for comprehensive assessment and monitoring of OA across countries, for example at the European level.

AB  - Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Open Access Availability of Publications of Faculty in Three Engineering Disciplines Abstract The analysis presented here provides a snapshot in time of the open access online availability of the five most recent works of engineering faculty in five institutions that overall have heavily populated institutional repositories. The incentive for the study was to provide a measure of the inclination of engineering faculty in specific disciplines to provide open access to their most current manuscripts or articles. The Web of Science database was used to choose the five most recent publications for each faculty member in each of three disciplines: civil, chemical, and mechanical engineering. The study was done for the five United States universities that had the most overall content in their repositories, as ranked by the Registry of Open Access Repositories (http://roar.eprints.org) at the time of data collection. One of these universities was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as having the number one engineering college among schools whose highest degree is a doctorate. To determine open access availability of each article via deposition in an institutional repository, each publication title was searched using the ROAR Content Search interface. To determine other forms of open access a Google Scholar search was used. The results of an analysis of these data collected for various sources of open access with breakdowns by college and department are provided. Introduction Under the leadership of MIT in developing the DSpace system, institutional repositories (IRs) [long term electronic archives of works authored by affiliates of the institution] emerged in the United States in the fall of 20021. Built on the concept of open access, defined for these purposes as freely available online access to full text articles, and with discipline repositories such as arXiv, as a precursor, many were founded with the “build it and they will come” concept. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) 2, whose activities are meant in part to serve as an aid in reducing financial pressures on libraries, defines institutional repositories in terms of capturing and preserving intellectual output in their August 2002 position paper3. The paper goes on to stress the importance of open or low-barrier access and the ability to share metadata with external systems to facilitate access to the broader research community. Clifford Lynch, Executive Director, Coalition for Networked Information, defines IRs in terms of a set of management and dissemination services provided by institutions. He stresses the importance of managing technological changes by migrating digital content to assure that at least their own intellectual content is preserved. With libraries increasingly cancelling their print subscriptions in favor of somewhat less costly online only access, where are the assurances to faculty that back content will be available to them through technology changes, publisher mergers, future journal cancellations, and whatever else might transpire to cause loss of access to online content? Lynch goes on to state “that a primary responsibility of our universities is both to make these resources available and to preserve them.”1 Touting the advantages of their own IR software platform, the Digital Commons, the Berkeley Electronic Press (BePress) President and Director of Journals explains that their product expands upon the service aspect, to actually

AB  - The year 2012 heralded significant developments in open access (OA) that impacted the relationships between the major stakeholders in scholarly publishing: researchers, funders, publishers and governments. In the UK, the clear preference for a gold OA policy enunciated by the government-backed ‘Finch Report’ is now being implemented by the research councils. Although the policy has been modified to include green routes to OA publishing, arguments continue about the optimal route to a system of open access that can work on a global scale. Resolution of these disputes will require courage and imagination.

AB  - Background/Context The open access movement has successfully drawn attention to economic and political aspects of scholarly communication through a significant body of commentary that debates the merits of open access and the potential damage it may do to scholarly publishing. Researchers within the field of education research, notably John Willinsky, have discussed the value and potential benefits of open access to fulfill the research mission and to improve the visibility of the field. There are now thousands of open access publications or content aggregators online. Researchers have adopted open access to varying degrees, but not as rapidly as proponents have hoped, while readers using traditional discovery services are less likely to encounter open access materials in their research than they are traditionally published scholarship. Purpose This article examines the opportunities that are available for researchers to adopt open access distribution and the factors that may impede their adoption. I synthesize recent studies of researchers’ attitudes toward, and understanding of, open access and examine the extent to which influential education research journals permit it. I focus on one of the primary methods of adopting open access—archiving versions of articles in open repository services—and demonstrate how that model can contribute to decontextualizing of research findings during discovery. Research Design This article is based primarily on a literature review and analysis, but also builds on an investigation of publisher policies through publicly accessible Web sites. Conclusions and Recommendations First, the success of the movement, and the ease with which data can be readily shared by anyone with net access, has contributed to an increasing expectation of “openness” and will change how research is conducted, shared, and authorized. Second, more research is needed on the attitudes and behavior of researchers in specific fields, especially education researchers, to understand how open access can support their needs as authors. Third, that understanding should be deployed to design services that can help close gaps in the research process. Openness should be adopted as a value in these services, not an end in itself.

TI  - Open Access Escape Room: the key to OA engagement?
VL  - 32
AU  - Sundsbø, Katrine

AB  - Open access (OA) has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on the scholarly publishing landscape in academia, yet many academic staff publish OA in order to comply with policies, rather than engaging with the value of open scholarship and in debates that ultimately affect them. Training sessions and workshops are often arranged to increase knowledge and awareness in the academic community, but engagement is often low. On the other hand, some academic staff, who already do engage, will happily attend sessions and workshops to increase their knowledge even further. The struggle to increase OA engagement overall could be due to the training not being appealing enough, and academics not being aware of benefits until after they have attended workshops. At the University of Essex, we took a bold, brave and curious approach to increasing engagement during Open Access Week 2018, and created an OA-themed escape room. This resulted in great engagement from students, academic staff and professional services staff, some of whom reported that they never knew how relevant OA was for them. The Open Access Escape Room was a success, and provided a positive environment for conversations around OA.

AB  - In 2013 the Obama administration mandated that scientific papers reporting the results of federally funded research be freely available one year after publication. This past December rumors spread that the Trump administration is considering reducing the embargo time to zero. Although the White House has yet to confirm a new mandate, the rumors were sufficiently substantiated that two coalitions of scholarly publishers promptly sent letters to President Trump urging him to reconsider.The case for immediate open access (OA) is strong. NASA, NSF, and other federal agencies disburse research grants that are funded by US taxpayers. Tuition revenue and state taxes fund scientists at public universities. Why, having helped pay for a research project, should a US taxpayer face the choice of either waiting 12 months to read the corresponding paper or paying for prompt access?Whether immediate OA becomes mandatory will depend in part on the opposing arguments. How persuasive are they?The 18 December letter to Trump organized by the Association of American Publishers (AAP) and signed by 135 professional societies builds its case around upholding US leadership in science. While I accept that invoking patriotism is sometimes necessary when appealing to politicians, I find the practice unsavory. Science is an international enterprise.Still, how strongly is a country’s scientific prestige tied to its homegrown journals? Weakly, in my view. None of the top physics journals is Japanese, yet Japan is a physics powerhouse. In 1994 Stuttgart-based Holtzbrinck Publishing Group bought a controlling stake in London-based Macmillan Publishers, owners of Nature, arguably the world’s foremost scientific journal. Nature and its swelling number of stablemates remain under German ownership. The UK’s standing in science has not fallen nor has Germany’s risen as a result.The AAP letter asserts that peer-reviewed articles are “licensed to users in hundreds of foreign countries, supporting billions of dollars in U.S. exports.” The United Nations recognizes 195 countries. Given that “hundreds” is an exaggeration, I suspect “billions” is too. Still, the authors of the AAP letter are right to point to the economic impact of immediate OA. The question of who pays is paramount.An 18 December letter to Trump signed by 62 scholarly publishers points out that scientific societies use subscription revenue to fund worthy activities. “One particular area of importance,” the letter says, “is strengthening U.S. STEM infrastructure through education, career, and outreach programs.” The transfer of money from libraries to societies is defensible. But it seems to me unfair to expect, say, the University of Tokyo or the Max Planck Society to subsidize programs that benefit the US.In its 2018 industry overview, the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers reported that its members incur expenses of around $4000 to publish a peer-reviewed paper in an archival journal.11. R. Johnson, A. Watkinson, M. Mabe, The STM Report: An Overview of Scientific and Scholarly Publishing, International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (2018). When publishers offer authors the option to make their papers freely and instantly accessible, the fee is also around $4000. Journal subscriptions are of the same order. Online-only subscriptions to the two biggest astronomy journals by volume, Astrophysical Journal and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, cost $2175 and $10 249 a year. (ApJ levies page charges to offset publishing expenses; MNRAS does not.)With those numbers in mind, you can see how the impact of immediate OA depends on how prolific an institution’s researchers are. If an astronomy department publishes more than four or so papers a year, buying subscriptions could be cheaper than paying author fees. Kent Anderson made that point last year in The Scholarly Kitchen: The subscription model, he contends, is significantly more cost-effective than the OA model because publishing expenses are borne by both readers and authors.22. K. Anderson, “Guest Post: The Surprisingly Low Burden of Subscriptions at Institutions,” The Scholarly Kitchen (21 May 2019).Despite its advantages, the subscription model is overstretched. As diagnosed by Aileen Fyfe and her coauthors,33. A. Fyfe et al., “Untangling Academic Publishing: A History of the Relationship . . . ,” Zenodo (25 May 2017). the underlying problem is that academics are evaluated on research published in traditional journals despite the existence of alternative outlets. So they publish more, and scholarly publishers, whether for-profit or nonprofit, respond by launching more journals. Libraries’ bills keep going up.Immediate OA would bring relief to libraries and compel researchers to be more judicious in what they publish, but at what cost?ReferencesSection:ChooseTop of pageReferences <<CITING ARTICLES1.

AB  - Many libraries offer open access publishing funds to support authors in paying article processing charges (APC) levied by some OA journals. However, there are few standard practices for managing or assessing these funds. The Open Access Working Group (OAWG) of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL) was asked to investigate and articulate best practices for successful open access fund management. In spring 2015, the OAWG surveyed Canadian academic libraries with OA funds to review their criteria and collect feedback on current practices. The survey proved timely because many OA funds are under review. Shrinking budgets, ending pilots, and questions around scale and sustainability of funds provide context for some institutions revisiting or reconfiguring these funds. At the same time, Canada’s principal funding agencies have issued the new Tri‐Agency Open Access Policy on Publications (effective May 2015) which mandates open access for funded research and which is increasing the demand from researchers for financial support from their institutions to pay APCs and other OA costs. This paper addresses findings of the survey, some best practices for open access publishing fund management, and counter arguments for OA funds, as well as other strategies developed by international agencies including the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC).

AB  - Abstract Open access (OA) to research publications is of global relevance, both in terms of provision and consumption of scholarly content. However, much of the research, practice, and models surrounding OA have been centered around the Global North. In this study we investigate how and to what degree higher education institutions (HEIs) in Angola interact with the concept of OA to journal publications through their policies and practices, a country where the end of the civil war in 2002 marked a new start for growth in teaching and research. This study is based on an online survey conducted in 2020 among research management units of Angolan HEIs. 23 valid institutional responses were received of 44 invitations sent (52% response rate). The results suggest that Angolan HEIs have moderate awareness of OA but practical incorporation into academic processes has remained slow, however, this can be seen to be connected to the overall slow progress in ramping up research intensity in the country. Seven of the responding institutions reported to be involved in publishing scholarly journals, all of them OA. Overall Angolan HEIs have few institutional repositories, and have so far placed little value on OA in the context of academic career advancement.

AB  - Scholarly communication change and open access (OA) initiatives in Australia have followed an Odyssean path in the last decade. The stop-start nature of early initiatives demonstrates that institutional leadership is essential for the successful deposit of academic content in an institutional repository. Similarly, OA policies from the two Australian Research Councils were delayed for nearly a decade, partly due to publisher pressure and bureaucratic conservatism. More successful has been the development of full, or hybrid, open access university e-presses. These presses, usually embedded in the scholarly infrastructure of the university, provide monographic models for wider global consideration. Australian universities are now reflecting, partly through recent Research Council edicts and monitoring global OA developments, greater awareness of the need for action in scholarly communication change.

AB  - The current state of open access to journal publications within research areas belonging to the humanities has received relatively little research attention. This study provides a detailed mapping of the bibliometric state of open access to journal publications among ethicists, taking into account not only open access publishing in journals directly, but also where and in what form ethicists make their journal articles available elsewhere on the web. As part of the study 297 ethicists affiliated with top-ranking philosophy departments were identified and their journal publication information for the years 2010–2015 were recorded (1682 unique articles). The journal articles were then queried for through Google Scholar in order to establish open access status (web locations, document versions) of each publication record. Publication records belonging to the 20 most frequently used journal outlets (subset of 597 unique articles) were put under closer inspection with regards to alignment with publisher copyright restrictions as well as measuring unused potential to share articles. The results show that slightly over half of recent journal publications are available to read for free. PhilPapers and academic social networks (Academia.edu and ResearchGate) were found to be key platforms for research dissemination in ethics research. The representation of institutional repositories as providers of access was found to be weak, receiving the second lowest frequency rating among the eight discrete web location categories. Further, the study reveals that ethicists are at the same time prone to copyright infringement and undersharing their scholarly work.

AB  - Open access (OA) is often considered as particularly beneficial to researchers in the global south. However, research into awareness of and attitudes to OA has been largely dominated by voices from the global north. A survey was conducted of 507 researchers from the developing world and connected to INASP's AuthorAID project to ascertain experiences and attitudes to OA publishing. The survey revealed problems for the researchers in gaining access to research literature in the first place. There was a very positive attitude to OA research and OA journals, but when selecting a journal in which to publish, OA was seen as a much less important criterion than factors relating to international reputation. Overall, a majority of respondents had published in an OA journal and most of these had paid an article processing charge. Knowledge and use of self-archiving via repositories varied, and only around 20% had deposited their research in an institutional repository. The study also examined attitudes to copyright, revealing most respondents had heard of Creative Commons licences and were positive about the sharing of research for educational use and dissemination, but there was unease about research being used for commercial purposes. Respondents revealed a surprisingly positive stance towards openly sharing research data, although many revealed that they would need further guidance on how to do so. The survey also revealed that the majority had received emails from so called “predatory” publishers and that a small minority had published in them.

AB  - In this article we argue that the current endeavors to achieve open access in scientific literature require a discussion about innovation in scholarly publishing and research infrastructure. Drawing on path dependence theory and addressing different open access (OA) models and recent political endeavors, we argue that academia is once again running the risk of outsourcing the organization of its content.

AB  - In this paper, we locate open access in the South African higher education research context where it is, distinctively, not shaped by the policy frameworks that are profoundly changing research dissemination behaviour in other parts of the world. We define open access and account for its rise by two quite different routes. We then present a case study of journal publishing at one South African university to identify existing journal publishing practices in terms of open access. This case provides the springboard for considering the implications – both positive and negative – of global open access trends for South African – and other – research and researchers. We argue that academics’ engagement with open access and scholarly communication debates is in their interests as global networked researchers whose virtual identities and online scholarship are now a critical aspect of their professional engagement.

AB  - Adoption of open access in the humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS) is a work in progress, with lower engagement in HASS than most of the natural sciences. HASS research impacts how we live, how we learn and how we see ourselves, and research institutions should encourage and enable their HASS research communities to increase the prevalence of open access research outputs. Six experienced HASS researchers at a single academic institution in Perth, Australia, were interviewed to explore their perceptions and experiences of open access, and any barriers that they had encountered. Thematic analysis was used to code the transcribed interviews, and generate themes. This study found a wide variance in the adoption of open access practices among HASS researchers. Some participants are publishing via APC-based gold open access (in DOAJ listed journals), while other participants encounter multiple barriers to sharing more of their work as open access. Confusion about aspects of open access is evident. Even among participants who support open access, some have had poor experiences of open access publishing. This research also found that some participants hold extremely complex opinions on open access, which directly influence participants’ behaviour depending on which perspective they are considering. These perspectives are: research supervisor, editorial role at journal, funding assessor and global citizen. Within HASS a diversity of behaviours exists around open access, and research institutions need to tailor their research support services around open access and scholarly publishing for different communities of researchers.

AB  - The idea of “Open Access” (hereafter OA) emerged in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s with a noble goal: to provide comprehensive access to the scholarly literature for everyone around the world by making the results of scholarly research freely and immediately available online to all. After more than 20 years of OA advocacy and development, where do things stand? Has the noble goal of universal access been realized, and is the scholarly literature now accessible and open to the global community of scholars? How strong is the current OA movement and where is it headed? While significant advances have been made, to be sure, the fact is that elements of OA have taken a wrong turn somewhere, resulting in a system that is broken and has not lived up to its promise. Early OA efforts focused on the need for better access to read and reuse scholarly literature. While significant advancement has been made in this area, it has created another barrier to the free and open sharing of scholarly research–access for authors to publish their research. This is especially problematic for those without the means or support to participate in the “pay to publish” model of OA that has become dominant. There is still hope to correct this imbalance, but the scholarly community must refocus and recalibrate its efforts to get back on track.

AB  - ABSTRACT The two primary means for accomplishing Open Access (OA) goals are the "author pays" or Gold model and the "self-archiving" or Green model, both of which can have variations or hybrids. There is a growing schism between proponents of the Gold and Green models. Scholar uptake on self-archiving has been very limited. At the same time, a great deal of concern has been expressed regarding the Gold model, particularly with regard to cost and the role of peer-review lite journals. With the evolving OA environment as a backdrop, the authors conducted a survey of university engineering faculty in order to better understand their OA practices and attitudes. The scholarly communication needs and activities of engineering faculty are more diverse than other scholars in that they have a broader and more varied literature, which includes journal articles, conference papers, technical reports, standards, handbook information, patents, and grey literature. The survey was comprised of 12 Likert scale questions and 3 open comment questions. The results of the survey of engineering faculty were consistent with other studies that have revealed concerns over the author pays model and a reluctance to self-archive in the university institutional repository (IR). Survey results showed that engineering faculty do not extensively publish in author pays Gold journals and had limited plans to do so in the future. In line with other studies, the survey revealed that there was a lack of familiarity with campus IRs and a very small uptake rate for depositing research output in institutional repositories.

AB  - The number of open access (OA) journals and their share of all scholarly journals are usually estimated based on indexing in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). DOAJ's coverage of OA journals from different regions of the world is, however, far from complete, particularly of journals publishing in languages other than English. Using alternative data sources for identification and manual verification, 437 scholarly OA journals published in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) were identified, and some key characteristics were studied. Of these, only 184 were indexed in DOAJ. A vast majority of the journals was published by scholarly societies or universities. Social sciences and humanities dominated as topics, and few journals charge authors. National or university‐specific OJS portals have played a major role in enabling OA publishing. Around a third of the Nordic scholarly journals are currently OA.

AB  - Accessing quality research when not part of an academic institution can be challenging. Dating back to the 1980s, open access (OA) was a response to journal publishers who restricted access to publications by requiring a subscription and limited access to knowledge. Although the OA movement seeks to remove costly barriers to accessing research, especially when funded by state and federal governments, it remains the subject of continuous debates. After providing a brief overview of OA, this article summarizes OA statutory and regulatory developments at the federal and state levels regarding free and open access to research. It compares similarities and differences among enacted and proposed legislation and describes the advantages and disadvantages of these laws. It analyzes the effects of these laws in higher education, especially on university faculty regarding tenure and promotion decisions as well as intellectual property rights to provide recommendations and best practices regarding the future of legislation and regulation in the United States.

AB  - Purpose Open-access mega-journals (OAMJs) represent an increasingly important part of the scholarly communication landscape. OAMJs, such as PLOS ONE , are large scale, broad scope journals that operate an open access business model (normally based on article-processing charges), and which employ a novel form of peer review, focussing on scientific “soundness” and eschewing judgement of novelty or importance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the discourses relating to OAMJs, and their place within scholarly publishing, and considers attitudes towards mega-journals within the academic community. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a review of the literature of OAMJs structured around four defining characteristics: scale, disciplinary scope, peer review policy, and economic model. The existing scholarly literature was augmented by searches of more informal outputs, such as blogs and e-mail discussion lists, to capture the debate in its entirety. Findings While the academic literature relating specifically to OAMJs is relatively sparse, discussion in other fora is detailed and animated, with debates ranging from the sustainability and ethics of the mega-journal model, to the impact of soundness-only peer review on article quality and discoverability, and the potential for OAMJs to represent a paradigm-shifting development in scholarly publishing. Originality/value This paper represents the first comprehensive review of the mega-journal phenomenon, drawing not only on the published academic literature, but also grey, professional and informal sources. The paper advances a number of ways in which the role of OAMJs in the scholarly communication environment can be conceptualised.

AB  - This paper is the first of two Learned Publishing articles in which we report the results of a series of interviews with senior publishers and editors exploring open access megajournals ( OAMJs ). Megajournals (of which PLoS One is the best known example) represent a relatively new approach to scholarly communication and can be characterized as large, broad‐scope, open access journals that take an innovative approach to peer review, basing acceptance decisions solely on the technical or scientific soundness of the article. This model is often said to support the broader goals of the open science movement. Based on in‐depth interviews with 31 publishers and editors representing 16 different organizations (10 of which publish a megajournal), this paper reports how the term ‘megajournal’ is understood and publishers’ rationale and motivations for launching (or not launching) an OAMJ . We find that while there is general agreement on the common characteristics of megajournals, there is not yet a consensus on their relative importance. We also find seven motivating factors that were said to drive the launch of an OAMJ and link each of these factors to potential societal and business benefits. These results suggest that the often polarized debate surrounding OAMJs is a consequence of the extent to which observers perceive publishers to be motivated by these societal or business benefits.

AB  - Open access is a scholarly publishing model that has emerged as an alternative to traditional subscription-based journal publishing. This study explores the adoption of the open access movement worldwide and the role that libraries can play in addressing those factors which are slowing its progress within developing countries. The study has drawn upon both qualitative data from a focused literature review and quantitative data from major open access platforms. The results indicate that while the open access movement is steadily gaining acceptance worldwide, the progress in developing countries within geographical areas such as Africa, Asia and Oceania is quite a bit slower. Two significant factors are the cost of publishing fees and the lack of institutional open access mandates and policies to encourage uptake. The study provides suggested strategies for academic libraries to help overcome current challenges.

AB  - In recent years, scholarly publishing faced a new paradigm regarding the accessibility: the open access movement."If an article is "Open Access" it means that it can be freely accessed by anyone in the world using an internet connection".1 The Budapest Open Access Initiative states: "By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself".2 Some researchers may have never been concerned about this topic.It obviously means that they are affiliated with a rich institution from a rich country.There are few things more discouraging for a researcher than performing a literature search, retrieving a list of potentially interesting articles, and not being able to access many of them because one's library does not subscribe those journals.And this lack of access will increase, even in major Universities from rich countries 3 , where the average cost of subscription reached 12,000 USD per faculty member more than 10 years ago.

AB  - ABSTRACT This bibliometric study was performed to gain a better understanding of open access (OA) journal publishing at a large U.S. research university. While there is an increasing amount of aggregated data about OA publishing, there are few studies that examine local institutional OA publishing patterns. This study addresses that deficiency. Publications for Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) were located using Scopus and the Gold OA journals among those publications were identified. It was determined that approximately 9% of the articles published at TAMU were in Gold OA journals. Most of these journals were concentrated in Science (Q), Medicine (R), Agriculture (S), and Technology (T). The author rights of these journals were also examined and categorized. The majority of journals examined allowed authors to retain copyright, but more than 20% required the authors to transfer some or all of their copyright. To provide context and comparison, the percentage of Gold OA articles among 16 peer institutions, all public Association of Research Libraries (ARLs), was also determined using Web of Science. Gold OA publishing among the 16 peer institutions was between 4.99% and 9.45%. Scopus indicated a higher level of Gold OA publishing at TAMU compared to Web of Science.

AB  - Canadian university libraries, Canadian university presses, and non-university scholarly presses at Canadian universities were surveyed in the first part of 2010 as to the level of their support of Open Access (OA) journal publishing. Respondents were asked about journal hosting services in their organization as well as their thoughts on internal and external support for open access publishing. Results showed that most of the organizations are hosting OA journals, largely between one and five in number, and many supply journal hosting services, including some technical support. Personnel resources are a notable factor in the ability to host journals. Most respondents engage in some sort of internal support for open access publishing and are open to options that they are presently not utilizing. They are particularly amenable to OA publishing support from outside of their organizations, especially assistance at a consortial level.

AB  - Open Access (OA) describes the free, unrestricted access to and re-use of research articles. Recently, a new wave of interest, debate, and practice surrounding OA publishing has emerged. In this paper, we provide a simple overview of the trends in OA practice in the broad field of geochemistry. Characteristics of the approach such as whether or not an article processing charge (APC) exists, what embargo periods or restrictions on self-archiving’ policies are in place, and whether or not the sharing of preprints is permitted are described. The majority of journals have self-archiving policies that allow authors to share their peer reviewed work via green OA without charge. There is no clear relationship between journal impact and APC. The journals with the highest APC are typically those of the major commercial publishers, rather than the geochemistry community themselves. The rise in OA publishing has potential impacts on the profiles of researchers and tends to devolve costs from organizations to individuals. Until the geochemistry community makes the decision to move away from journal-based evaluation criteria, it is likely that such high costs will continue to impose financial inequities upon research community. However, geochemists could more widely choose legal self-archiving as an equitable and sustainable way to disseminate their research.

AB  - Campus-based open access author funds are being considered by many academic libraries as a way to support authors publishing in open access journals. Article processing fees for open access have been introduced recently by publishers and have not yet been widely accepted by authors. Few studies have surveyed authors on their reasons for publishing open access and their perceptions of open access journals. The present study was designed to gauge the uptake of library support for author funding and author satisfaction with open access publishing. Results indicate that York University authors are increasingly publishing in open access journals and are appreciative of library funding initiatives. The wider implications of open access are discussed along with specific recommendations for publishers.

AB  - In recent years open access models have transcended traditional modes of publishing, thus enabling freer access to research. This paper takes a trans-regional approach to open access publishing in the Asia and Oceania region focussing on individual institutions in three countries – Charles Darwin University (Australia), University of Hong Kong and the University of Malaya, reflecting on how each one is rising, in its own individual way, to meet the range of challenges that its research communities are facing. Specifically, it focuses on open access and institutional repository development, and traces their development at each of the aforementioned institutions. This paper is based on interviews conducted with staff involved with the development of the repository, and the open access collection in particular, at each of the three institutions. It synthesises open access developments and reviews the role the library has played in each institution in the development of open access across the academic and research community; and the success that has been achieved to date. It highlights any common factors between the approaches taken by each institution, as well as any significant differences of note. The findings reveal that each of the three institutions is at a different stage of development with the University of Hong Kong repository ranked at the top within Asia. Each has used a slightly different approach toward open access, and used different software to develop their repository. The authors have collated the overall experiences of each institution in open access publishing and repository development. They have highlighted the successes and failures that each has experienced and formulated a set of guidelines that may help those embarking on establishing an open access repository.

AB  - In this opinion article, the author describes his experiences of naming, listing, and analyzing predatory journals. The gold open-access model has led to the creation of many predatory journals that exist only to exploit researchers. Medical research is the most valuable research for humans, so we must guard against the publishing of medical research in predatory journals. Community-based journals that combine a geographical and a disciplinary focus may be seen as a defense against the pathological nature of predatory publishers.

AB  - Abstract The goal of open access is to allow more people to read and use research outputs. An observed association between highly cited research outputs and open access has been claimed as evidence of increased usage of the research, but this remains controversial. A higher citation count also does not necessarily imply wider usage such as citations by authors from more places. A knowledge gap exists in our understanding of who gets to use open access research outputs and where users are located. Here we address this gap by examining the association between an output’s open access status and the diversity of research outputs that cite it. By analysing large-scale bibliographic data from 2010 to 2019, we found a robust association between open access and increased diversity of citation sources by institutions, countries, subregions, regions, and fields of research, across outputs with both high and medium–low citation counts. Open access through disciplinary or institutional repositories showed a stronger effect than open access via publisher platforms. This study adds a new perspective to our understanding of how citations can be used to explore the effects of open access. It also provides new evidence at global scale of the benefits of open access as a mechanism for widening the use of research and increasing the diversity of the communities that benefit from it.

C1  - Information Systems Science, Hanken School of Economics, 00100 Helsinki, Finland
AB  - The research literature on open access (OA) publishing has mainly dealt with journals publishing in English, and studies focusing on OA journals in other languages are less common. This article addresses this gap via a case study focusing on Chinese-language OA journals. It starts with the identification of the major characteristics of this market, followed by eight semi-structured interviews to explore the key motivations behind Chinese-language OA publishing and perceived barriers. The majority of Chinese OA journals are published in Chinese, and most of them are published by universities and scholarly societies. Nearly 80% of journals were launched before the digital age and were converted to OA later. The subject distribution is highly skewed towards the science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) fields. Publishers are motivated to convert journals to OA by an expected increase in academic impact, which would also attract more submissions. The lack of a sufficient number of high-quality submissions is perceived as the largest barrier to the successful publishing of journals. The financial instability of journals is identified as the main obstacle hindering internationalisation. The central conclusions of the study are that Chinese-language OA journals need to increase their visibility in journal indexes such as the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and that an OA publishing platform (similar to the Latin American SciELO) should be established for Chinese-language OA journals.

AB  - &lt;p&gt;This article presents the rationale, common practices, challenges, and some personal anecdotes from a journal editor on the production, use, and re-use of peer-reviewed, scholarly articles as open educational resources (OER). The scholarly and professional discourse related to open educational resources has largely focused on open learning objects, courseware, and textbooks. However, especially in graduate education, articles published in scholarly journals are often a major component of the course content in formal education. In addition, open access journal articles are critical to expanding access to knowledge by scholars in the developing world and in fostering citizen science, by which everyone has access to the latest academic information and research results. In this article, I highlight some of the challenges, economic models, and evidence for quality of open access journal content and look at new affordances provided by the Net for enhanced functionality, access, and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the seventeen years since I graduated with a doctorate degree, the climate and acceptance of open access publishing has almost reversed itself. I recall a conversation with my PhD supervisor in which he argued that publishing online was not a viable option as the product would not have permanency, scholarly recognition, or the prestige of a paper publication. His comments reflect the confusion between online resources and those described as open access, but as well illustrate the change in academic acceptance and use of open access products during the past decade. The evolution from paper to online production and consumption is a disruptive technology in which much lower cost and increased accessibility of online work opens the product to a completely new group of potential users. In the case of OER these consumers are primarily students, but certainly access to scholars from all parts of the globe and the availability to support citizen science (Silvertown, 2009) should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - he world of scientific research and scholarly publishing is undergoing a profound transformation in large part due to the rapid development of information and communication technologies.The Internet and the advent of faster networking capabilities now allow virtually unlimited access to information, remote data gathering, real-time integration of data into databases and models, and online purchasing of research supplies.At the same time, it has opened new possibilities for researchers to communicate with colleagues and with the society in general.However, although some investigators in the developing world are keeping pace with this new reality, the majority are largely excluded from this transformation because of their limited access to scientific information.Particularly relevant to the area of pathogen research, the vast majority of infectious diseases in humans, animals, and plants occurs in the developing world, and efficient communication between local scientists in developing countries and the global community will facilitate advances in knowledge and control of these pathogens.Here we discuss open access and socially responsible philosophies in relation to scientific training, publishing, and intellectual property, and give examples of how we can help keep the developing world fully informed about these new models.The first step is training partners in developing countries in laboratory techniques and epidemiological skills that complement their existing programs, as well as developing their proficiency in grant proposal writing.A number of organizations have undertaken workshops on such topics around the world, including the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/en/), the Pan American Health Organization (http://www.paho.org), the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health (http:// www.fic.nih.gov), and the Sustainable Sciences Institute ([SSI]; http://www.ssilink.org),which we represent.SSI is a San Francisco-based organization that helps scientists in underprivileged environments gain access to the resources, technologies, skills, and knowledge they need to conduct cutting-edge research with an impact on public health and to effectively communicate their results [1].Importantly, these organizations make the content of their courses freely available to participants in the workshops and others, similar to an open-access policy.Performing research is not the only issue at stake; the scientific community evaluates career advancement and stature primarily by the number and quality of published research articles in peer-reviewed journals, and few investigators in developing countries receive training on how to convert their work into publishable manuscripts.

AB  - In this paper, we respond to five rebuttals to Kingsley and Kennan (2015). Four researchers in the information systems field and a university library director of research infrastructure provided these rebuttals. Almost without exception, the rebuttals from the information systems researchers take an analytical approach to the question of scholarly communication in their field. However, in undertaking their individual analyses of scholarly publishing or communication, they do not directly address the issues raised in our original debate piece. The rebuttal from the university library administrator (Groenewegen, 2015) alone directly addresses the discussion points raised in the original debate. As researchers in the field of scholarly communications, while this was not how we originally envisioned the debate, the rebuttals as a body of work have opened up some interesting themes, which we explore in addition to responding to the individual rebuttals.

AB  - With this paper, we hope to foster debate about the place of open access (OA) in scholarly publishing. After providing a background to OA’s development and current state, we examine some of the accusations leveled against it: that OA publishers are predatory, that OA is too expensive, and that self-depositing papers in OA repositories will bring about the end of scholarly publishing. After contextualizing each accusation, we show that they arise from problems with not only access, open or otherwise, but also the scholarly publishing system more broadly. Accordingly, we instead propose the discussions we believe the scholarly community should be having about scholarly publishing to take advantage of social and technological innovations and move it into the 21st century.

IS  - 1
VL  - 19
AU  - Scherlen, Allan
AU  - Robinson, Matthew
AB  - The paper argues that criminal justice scholarship disseminated through the traditional journal subscription model is not consistent with social justice. Adoption of "open access" principles in publishing benefits both authors and readers through broader and more egalitarian dissemination of criminal justice literature. Moreover, when viewed in light of social justice theory, open access is a more just method of scholarly communication. After providing a brief outline of the history and basic aspects of open access, the paper uses the framework of the social justice theories of John Rawls and David Miller to argue why open access is more just than traditional subscription models of publishing and why criminal justice scholars and their associations must consider the importance of supporting open access initiatives and promoting the dissemination of scholarship as widely as possible if they are concerned about attaining justice for criminal justice scholarly literature.

AB  - Abstract Editor's Summary Since the 1990s, the aim of open access (OA) has been to enhance scholarly communication by delivering scientific publications on the Internet without fees or restrictions. Adoption of the gold model of OA, electronic access to publishers' scientific journals at no cost, has been slow in the United States and the United Kingdom, even if authors pay an extra OA charge. The more successful route has been green OA, publishing the original or modified versions on authors' personal home pages or in institutional or subject‐specific repositories. In a 2008 sample of science disciplines, Bjork found 20.4% were provided OA, with 8.5% on publishers' sites. For information systems articles published in 2009, 21.3% were OA but a mere 0.6% on publishers' sites, the gold model. Of OA articles, 8% were published on domain repositories, 32.7% in institutional repositories, and 59% on other websites. Broad expansion of OA will depend on greater author awareness and wider platform access, and publishers must adopt international bibliographic metadata and standardized author identification.

AB  - Abstract Objective To study the impact of converting from subscription‐based publishing to open access (“flipping”) in three obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) journals. Methods We compared original articles in three OBGYN journals during a matched subscription‐based and open access publishing period. We analyzed citation metrics and country of authorship. Results Overall, 1522 studies were included; of those, 869 (57.1%) were before flipping and 653 (42.9%) were after flipping. There was a decrease in publications by lower‐middle income countries from 7.7% in subscription‐based publishing to 1.8% in open access ( P &lt; 0.001). There was a decrease in the proportion of articles from South Asia (2.5% vs 0.5%), North America (14.4% vs 9.4%), and the Middle East (7.4% vs 2.5%), and an increase in publications from East Asia and Pacific (17.4% vs 30.9%; P &lt; 0.001). The relative citation ratio was higher in the open access period (median 1.65 vs 0.95, P &lt; 0.001). The number of citations per year was higher in the open access period (median 3.0 vs 2.0, P &lt; 0.001). There was an increase in the proportion of funded studies (from 40.2% to 47.8%; P = 0.003). Conclusions Flipping to open access in OBGYN journals is associated with a citation advantage with major authorship changes, leading to inequity.

AB  - In the past few years there has been an ongoing debate as to whether the proliferation of open access (OA) publishing would damage the peer review system and put the quality of scientific journal publishing at risk. Our aim was to inform this debate by comparing the scientific impact of OA journals with subscription journals, controlling for journal age, the country of the publisher, discipline and (for OA publishers) their business model. The 2-year impact factors (the average number of citations to the articles in a journal) were used as a proxy for scientific impact. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) was used to identify OA journals as well as their business model. Journal age and discipline were obtained from the Ulrich's periodicals directory. Comparisons were performed on the journal level as well as on the article level where the results were weighted by the number of articles published in a journal. A total of 610 OA journals were compared with 7,609 subscription journals using Web of Science citation data while an overlapping set of 1,327 OA journals were compared with 11,124 subscription journals using Scopus data. Overall, average citation rates, both unweighted and weighted for the number of articles per journal, were about 30% higher for subscription journals. However, after controlling for discipline (medicine and health versus other), age of the journal (three time periods) and the location of the publisher (four largest publishing countries versus other countries) the differences largely disappeared in most subcategories except for journals that had been launched prior to 1996. OA journals that fund publishing with article processing charges (APCs) are on average cited more than other OA journals. In medicine and health, OA journals founded in the last 10 years are receiving about as many citations as subscription journals launched during the same period. Our results indicate that OA journals indexed in Web of Science and/or Scopus are approaching the same scientific impact and quality as subscription journals, particularly in biomedicine and for journals funded by article processing charges.

AB  - Abstract Editormetrics analyses the role of editors of academic journals and their impact on the scientific publication system. Such analyses would best rely on open, structured, and machine-readable data about editors and editorial boards, which still remains rare. To address this shortcoming, the project Open Editors collects data about academic journal editors on a large scale and structures them into a single dataset. It does so by scraping the websites of 7,352 journals from 26 publishers (including predatory ones), thereby structuring publicly available information (names, affiliations, editorial roles, ORCID etc.) about 594,580 researchers. The dataset shows that journals and publishers are immensely heterogeneous in terms of editorial board sizes, regional diversity, and editorial role labels. All codes and data are made available at Zenodo, while the result is browsable at a dedicated website (https://openeditors.ooir.org). This dataset carries implications for both practical purposes of research evaluation and for meta-scientific investigations into the landscape of scholarly publications, and allows for critical inquiries regarding the representation of diversity and inclusivity across academia.

AB  - <p class="p1">‘Public access to publicly funded research’ has been one of the rallying calls of the global open access movement. Governments and public institutions around the world have mandated that publications supported by public funding sources should be publicly accessible. Publishers are experimenting with new models to widen access. Yet financial flows underpinning scholarly publishing remain complex and opaque. In this article we present work to trace and reassemble a picture of financial flows around the publication of journals in the UK in the midst of a national shift towards open access. We contend that the current lack of financial transparency around scholarly communication is an obstacle to evidence-based policy-making – leaving researchers, decision-makers and institutions in the dark about the ­systemic implications of new financial models. We conclude that ­obtaining a more joined up picture of financial flows is vital as a means for researchers, ­institutions and others to understand and shape changes to the ­sociotechnical systems that underpin scholarly communication.

AB  - The article unpacks the publishing practices and focuses on the curating work carried out by the editors of chemistry journals. Based on a qualitative analysis of multiple sources in two publishing houses (the American Chemical Society, ACS and Nature Research), it first shows that the role of editor-in-chief covers a wide range of realities and is far from being limited to that of a gatekeeper (the most common metaphor in the literature). In journals that are part of the Nature Research portfolio, in-house editors, who are no longer active scientists, work full time for the journals. The article describes the professional trajectories and skills required to join the publishing house. Interviews highlight collective identity-based actions, attention to the growth and the flow of manuscripts, but also specific epistemic properties of outputs in chemistry. Besides tasks that editors outline “as really the same as they were 100 years ago,” as they spend most of their time handling manuscripts and providing quality assurance, they also travel to conferences to support journals and encourage submissions, visit labs where researchers pitch their work or ask questions about journals, and “educate the actors themselves” about new fields. In both cases studied, the publishing houses partner with institutions to offer events (ACS on Campus programme, Nature masterclass) that a university or department can freely host or buy, where editors organize workshops on all aspects of manuscript preparation. Second, publishing houses, whether non-for-profit or commercial, have embraced a catalog logic, where the journals are not necessarily in competition and have an assumed place and hierarchy. At Nature Research, editors-in-chief head business units inscribed in the company's organization. Despite standardized processes imposed by the procedural chain, there is still room to maneuver in these relatively autonomous structures that are ultimately evaluated on their results (the annual production of a certain number of high-quality papers). On the other hand, ACS is seen as a vessel whose course cannot easily be deviated. The conclusion calls for extending this type of investigation to other contexts or types of journals.

AB  - Metrics on open access (OA) availability of content published in scholarly journals (i.e. content licences, copyright ownership, and publisher-stipulated self-archiving permissions) are still scarce. This study implements the four core variables of the recently published Open Access Spectrum (OAS) (reader rights, reuse rights, copyright, and author posting rights) to measure the level of openness in all 1,728 Spanish scholarly journals listed in the Spanish national DULCINEA database at the end of 2015. Data exported from the database and used as variables for the analysis were: journal research area, type of publisher, type of access, self-archiving and reuse policy, and type of Creative Commons (CC) licence used. Out of the total number of journals (1,728), 1,285 (74.5%) published their articles OA immediately after initial publication and thus received the maximum OAS score for reader rights; 37.5% of all journals used CC licences, and 79.5% allowed self-archiving in some form. In 72% of journals, authors retained or publishers granted broad rights, which included author reuse and authorization rights (for others to reuse), whilst 13.5% did not specify any terms for copyright transfer. Similar studies could be carried out on other countries as this would enable comparisons of the general adoption and form of openness in different parts of the world.

AB  - Abstract Open peer review (OPR), where review reports and reviewers’ identities are published alongside the articles, represents one of the last aspects of the open science movement to be widely embraced, although its adoption has been growing since the turn of the century. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of OPR adoption, its early adopters and the implementation approaches used. Current bibliographic databases do not systematically index OPR journals, nor do the OPR journals clearly state their policies on open identities and open reports. Using various methods, we identified 617 OPR journals that published at least one article with open identities or open reports as of 2019 and analyzed their wide-ranging implementations to derive emerging OPR practices. The findings suggest that: (1) there has been a steady growth in OPR adoption since 2001, when 38 journals initially adopted OPR, with more rapid growth since 2017; (2) OPR adoption is most prevalent in medical and scientific disciplines (79.9%); (3) five publishers are responsible for 81% of the identified OPR journals; (4) early adopter publishers have implemented OPR in different ways, resulting in different levels of transparency. Across the variations in OPR implementations, two important factors define the degree of transparency: open identities and open reports. Open identities may include reviewer names and affiliation as well as credentials; open reports may include timestamped review histories consisting of referee reports and author rebuttals or a letter from the editor integrating reviewers’ comments. When and where open reports can be accessed are also important factors indicating the OPR transparency level. Publishers of optional OPR journals should add metric data in their annual status reports.

AB  - Open peer review (OPR) is a type of review that has long since made space alongside the more well-known single-blind and double-blind peer reviews. Despite this, we still do not have a shared definition by the scientific community and publishers. The purpose of this paper is to offer some reflections on the selection of reviewers in OPR, a process that in its current configuration is traced back to the 19th century. After a brief overview of the best-known definitions of open peer review, the paper continues with an analysis of some aspects of reviewer selection carried out with the help of data from a recent survey.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore the status of research data sharing among researchers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and internationally. Relevant data was extracted from the Data Citation Index (DCI) using an advanced search strategy, which was limited to the publication years between 2009 and 2014. Data was analysed to obtain the number of data records by country, institution, subject category, year of publication, and document type as well as the number of citations. A Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to gauge the relationship between the data records and research articles. Findings indicate that only 20 (out of 50) countries in sub-Saharan Africa produced at least one data record in the DCI, with South Africa leading the pack with 539 (61.39 %) records followed by Kenya, Cameroon and Ghana. SSA contributes a mere 0.03 % of the world's research data as compared to 1.4 % of the world's research articles. Research institutions and universities are the major contributors of research data, which largely focuses on Genetics and Heredity (61.3 %), Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (61.3 %), Agriculture (29.2 %) and Forestry (27.3 %). Citation-wise, the research data has attracted fewer average citations than the articles. A correlational analysis of the data reveals that there is a significant correlation between the publication of data and research articles.

AB  - South African higher education institutions are the largest producers of research output on the African continent. Given this status, South African researchers have a moral obligation to share their research output with the rest of the continent via a medium that minimizes challenges of access; open scholarship is that medium. The majority of South African higher education libraries provide an open access publishing service. However, in most of these cases this service is via engagement with the green open access route, that is, institutional repositories (IR). Some of the libraries have piloted and adopted gold open access services such as publishing of "diamond" gold open access journals and supporting article processing charges. The experiment with publishing open monographs is a new venture. This venture must be viewed against the backdrop of the need for open educational resources (OERs). OER is an area that is very much in a fledgling stage and is gaining traction, albeit, at a slow pace. The growth of IRs, the growth in support for gold open access including the library acting as a publisher, the experimentation with open monographs, and OERs are all shaping South Africa's scholarly publishing roadmap.

AB  - The ever-increasing journal subscriptions have seen many universities and research institutions failing to provide access to the much-needed scholarship for propagation of research and development due to dwindling budget allocations. Hence, the adoption of open access (OA) institutional repositories (IR) by the institutions to increase access, availability and visibility of their research output to a wider readership. Institutional repository (IR) technologies have transformed the traditional academic library practice, thus upsetting the work culture of librarians. Though studies there have been studies on the impact of IRs on academic librarians elsewhere in the world, none have been done on the Zimbabwean context. This study draws from a wider study which explored utilisation of institutional repositories in Zimbabwe's public universities. The study sought to answer the question: What is the role of the academic librarian in promoting the institutional repository? The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of technology (UTAUT) informed the study, while a mixed methods approach was employed using document analysis, questionnaires and interviews to collect data from librarians in eight public universities. Findings revealed that in some instances IR responsibilities were added to existing duties for incumbent staff while in others, staff were reassigned to IR roles resulting in diverse staff categories maintaining the IRs across the universities. Recommendations for effective and efficient management of the repositories by the universities are made. The study is relevant to other academic libraries in developing countries and Africa particularly countries whose economies are crumbling.

AB  - The business model of paid publishers for scientific journals has been criticized for various reasons, including the potential for financial gain to take precedence over the advancement of science. Some argue that this model restricts access to critical scientific research, particularly for those who cannot afford expensive journal subscriptions, hindering the progress of science.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide a review of recent trends in the open access (OA) movement, as well as to discuss the significance of those trends for information access in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach An analysis of the recent literature was carried out, focusing on the benefits of a greater information access in developing countries. The paper also brings together the diverse experiences from the authors on OA publishing and archiving with institutions in a number of developing countries. Findings Knowledge workers in developing countries are now getting access to scholarly and scientific publications and electronic resources at a level that is unmatched historically. This is highly significant, if developing countries are to meet the millennium development goals. The OA movement and the growing number of Open Archive Initiative‐compliant institutional repositories promise to provide even greater access to resources and publications that were previously inaccessible. These low cost technology and interoperability standards are providing great opportunities for libraries and publishers in developing countries to disseminate local research and to bridge the south‐north knowledge gap. Originality/value This paper therefore provides recommendations for knowledge workers on how to actively participate in and contribute to the global knowledge commons. The results and recommendations contained in the paper should be of interest to authors, policy makers, funding agencies and information professionals in both developing and developed countries.

AB  - It was while drafting an editorial on the timely subject of publishing ethics that it first came to light that Biology Open (BiO) was one of the journals that received as a submission a spoof article devised by a journalist working for the journal Science (Bohannon, 2013). The article was described as being obviously flawed to any competent scientist. 304 spoof articles were submitted to Open Access (OA) journals worldwide, including BiO: at the time the Science report was published, 157 of the journals had accepted the paper and 98 had rejected it. Reassuringly, the handling editor at BiO had editorially rejected the article.There has been much discussion of this ‘sting’ within the science and publishing community. In particular, several commentators have highlighted and questioned why only OA journals were tested in this way; there was no control to test the rate of acceptance of the spoof paper in non-OA journals, even though these findings have been (and were perhaps intended to be) interpreted by some as proof that OA publishing is in some way inherently flawed.Although BiO seems to have passed some sort of test (and, in fact, has a rejection rate of about 50%), no journal can afford to be complacent. The soundness of BiO's peer review process and associated ethical practices will continue to be a key focus of its editors, and now seems a good time to reiterate some of the principles that guide our editorial policy.Unbiased, independent, critical assessment is of vital importance in scholarly publishing (Raff, 2013). BiO aims to provide rapid peer-reviewed publication of scientifically sound observations and conclusions. Reviewers are asked to confirm that the experimental work is properly conducted and that the conclusions are adequately supported by the data. We do not require any assessment of the significance, relative importance or impact of a paper, as we believe this will gradually emerge post-publication. Therefore, we ask reviewers to simply address the following criteria:We are currently implementing the addition of a new acceptance criterion – that the methods used are described in sufficient detail to allow proper repetition of the experiments. Recent articles have highlighted failures in the reliability and reproducibility of published research (e.g. http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility) and we believe that it is important to tackle this issue.Over the past decade or so, many initiatives and codes of practice have been established within the scientific publishing community. Many now feel routine (such as having dotted lines between spliced gel lanes), whereas others continue to evolve. The Company of Biologists is a member of COPE, The Committee on Publication Ethics (http://publicationethics.org). When the decision was made to launch BiO, it was the COPE guidelines and codes of practice that were employed. In addition, BiO follows the International Committee of Medical Journal Editor's (http://www.icmje.org) recommendations for the “conduct, reporting, editing and publication of scholarly work in medical journals”.Among the many important practices that have been instituted is the publication of Conflict of Interest and Author Contribution statements. The policies briefly described below have been devised in conjunction with our academic partners to ensure the accurate, timely, fair and ethical peer review and publication of scientific papers submitted to BiO.Adjustment of digital images with computer software is acceptable. However, the final image must remain representative of the original data. BiO checks figures for evidence of image manipulation (Rossner and Yamada, 2004). In addition, the corresponding author is required to certify at submission that they are aware of all manipulations performed on any digital images that accompany their article.A competing or conflict of interest is anything that might (or might be perceived to) inappropriately influence (bias) the full and objective presentation, review or publication of research findings. Competing interests can be financial, professional or personal, and can be held by authors, their employers, sponsors of the work, reviewers, Editors and editorial staff.BiO requires that a Conflict of Interest statement be included in each article, even if this is used to declare that there are no conflicts. Authors must include information regarding the provider of financial and material support of their research in the Funding section. Reviewers, Editors and Editorial staff are also required to disclose financial or professional associations that might interfere with their objectivity.Recent discussions have focused on the evolving issue of authorship. BiO requires that authors include a statement in the manuscript that specifies the contributions of each author. An author is someone who has made significant and substantial contributions to a study. These should include conception, design, execution and interpretation of the data being published, and preparing the article.The ICMJE has recently proposed a new criterion for authorship. This states that an author must “be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. In addition to being accountable for the parts of the work he or she has done, an author should be able to identify which co-authors are responsible for specific other parts of the work. In addition, authors should have confidence in the integrity of the contributions of their co-authors.” This has prompted discussion of the genuine feasibility of this, in particular with regards to large multi-centre research.The BiO submission process is set by default to ensure that all authors are included in relevant editorial correspondence. Papers must be submitted with the agreement of all authors, and all authors must approve the version to be published. However, this can't always protect the journal from those intent on perpetrating misconduct, such as using fake but active and plausible email addresses for co-authors who may not be aware that an article has been submitted in their name – to use one actual example.Despite the policies, checks and balances that have been implemented, it can be difficult to identify and block papers that include flawed work or outright fraudulent data. Although BiO passed the spoof paper ‘test’, we will continue to review our role in maintaining the integrity of the scientific record.

AB  - This article investigates the developments during the last decades in the use of languages, publication types and publication channels in the social sciences and humanities (SSH). The purpose is to develop an understanding of the processes of internationalization and to apply this understanding in a critical examination of two often used general criteria in research evaluations in the SSH. One of them is that the coverage of a publication in Scopus or Web of Science is seen in itself as an expression of research quality and of internationalization. The other is that a specific international language, English, and a specific type of publication, journal articles, are perceived as supreme in a general hierarchy of languages and publication types. Simple distinctions based on these criteria are contrary to the heterogeneous publication patterns needed in the SSH to organize their research adequately, present their results properly, reach their audiences efficiently, and thereby fulfil their missions. Research quality, internationalization, and societal relevance can be promoted in research assessment in the SSH without categorical hierarchies of publications. I will demonstrate this by using data from scholarly publishing in the SSH that go beyond the coverage in the commercial data sources in order to give a more comprehensive representation of scholarly publishing in the SSH.

AB  - ABSTRACT In support of investigating the effects of systematic archiving of authors' final peer‐reviewed, accepted manuscripts (green open access), PEER has developed a robust observatory infrastructure which has already successfully processed over 44,000 manuscripts. Technical challenges successfully overcome by the project include non‐uniformity of manuscript files and metadata formats, embargo management, and author authentication for repository deposit. Three areas of research investigating (i) author and reader attitudes and behaviours, (ii) article‐level usage at repositories and publisher platforms, and (iii) the economics of large‐scale archiving have been commissioned and are producing results. The baseline behavioural survey identified an increasing general awareness of open access, but a lower awareness of institutional and subject repositories. Perceptions were also found to vary depending on whether individuals were responding from an author or reader perspective. PEER itself has seen low uptake from authors when invited to self‐deposit into the project. Further results from all three research areas are due before the project ends in May 2012.

AB  - Scholarly peer review (also known as refereeing or reviewing) is defined as the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal, conference proceedings, book chapter, or as an entire book. The peer review process helps the publisher (ie, the editor-in-chief, the editorial board, or the program committee) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer reviews improve the quality of scholarly publishing, and indirectly, the quality of the research behind it. All legitimate academic journals that publish research reports depend on peer review as a means of assuring the quality of the articles that they publish. But the process has far wider implications than that. Universities commonly view an academic's published research record as the main criterion for reaching decisions related to promotions and tenure. No matter how much they may say about the importance of teaching effectiveness, academic publishing is usually the overriding determinant for career progression. Accordingly, everything associated with the publishing process is a matter of concern for career-minded researchers. There are other issues surrounding academic publishing that researchers need to understand well, including electronic publishing and open access, and they are reported well elsewhere, but peer review remains critical in all such debates. However, whilst the process is nowhere near perfect and has many critics, it remains the primary means for determining the important issue of whether a research manuscript should be published, and it should, therefore, be made as good as it can be for the sake of the journals, as well as for the careers of their authors. Peer review is carried out by scholars who have been recognised as experts in their fields. They will normally have already published several journal and/or conference papers, thereby coming to the attention of journal editors. Being invited by a journal or conference to perform peer reviews is, therefore, a worthy achievement and a valuable milestone in an academic career. However, it is possible that few such individuals will have received much training or mentoring in the review process, particularly in niche areas of academia. Indeed, receiving and responding to reviews of their own manuscripts may have been their only formal exposure to it. However, there are many resources available that outline the review process and the major publishers and journals provide reviewing guidelines and, in some cases, provide feedback to reviewers on their performance. As scholars, we have all benefited from peer review and, therefore, we have at least a moral obligation to pay forward that favour to those following behind us in the development of their careers. Moreover, if you are good at reviewing, there is a better chance of ultimately being invited to take up an editorial role in the journal that you review for, which is another worthy achievement and valuable milestone in terms of career progression. Without wishing to prescribe too heavily a format for a standard review, the following is a checklist that we have developed over the years to help prepare a review that is as comprehensive as it can be. If reviewers follow this checklist, it is highly probable that they can be confident that their review will be to the same standard. If authors are aware of the criteria against which their work is being judged, they will be better prepared to meet those criteria. This is by no means the only checklist. You can also find published examples of guides to reviewing, including: Lee (1995); Davison, de Vreede, and Briggs (2005). Wiley, the publisher of this journal, also has its own resources for reviewers here: https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/index.html. The manuscript is sufficiently detailed to permit a reader: The manuscript treats ethical issues adequately: The references are appropriate and up to date (see also Tarafdar & Davison, 2020). When authors receive a review, there is a specific process to follow. Please remember that the reviewers are freely giving their time for your benefit. Out of respect for them, it is important that you consider their review comments carefully. In principle, you should either expect to revise the manuscript following their advice, or if you disagree with the advice, then explain your reasoning carefully. If the reviewers contradict each other, the Senior Editor should provide advice on how to respond. If that advice is absent, you should contact the Senior Editor to request it. With respect to the mechanics of reporting how you have revised the article, there are a number of steps to take that will make both your life and that of the reviewers easier. First, you should prepare a table with three columns. The left column should contain a sequence number to indicate which comment is being addressed. The middle column contains the comment from each reviewer. In the right column, next to each comment, you should describe your response to the comment. This may be in the form of some revision to the manuscript, or, if you disagree with the comment, your justification for so doing. Preparing your response in this way is a big help for the reviewer, who is unlikely to relish re-reading the manuscript looking for the changes you have made and determining how they relate to the comments in each of the reviews. If you just say, “see page 6, para 2,” or words to that effect, this will not endear yourself to the reviewer. See Table 1 below for an example of how to create this table of revision notes. To conclude, experienced reviewers and journal editors will probably agree that as a reviewer the more you put into conducting a review, the more you will get back from conducting it. Likewise, as an author, the more attention you pay to your responses to reviews, the more likely it will be that your manuscript will be published.

AB  - Scholarly journals provide a record of the research, issues, and concerns of a field. Authors have their names associated with their individual articles, while editors are connected with a publication. However, there is another group of individuals who are often left out of the record, although their contributions are just as critical in the formation of scholarly journals. This article will take a look at this group of peer reviewers, to provide demographic data as well as understanding for the reasons individuals take on the duty of peer reviewer.

AB  - Evening trails by Brian Smithson. Shared from https://www.flickr.com/photos/smithser/10709730483/ under a CC BY 2.0 license Peer Review involves several divergent groups. Authors, who wish to see the results of scrupulous work published, in the anticipation of career promotion or secure funding. Editors, who are under pressure to identify sound and novel research. Reviewers, who try to fit a thoughtful and time-consuming process within busy schedules, often receiving no credit for it. And Publishers, who compete in a transforming landscape of fast and abundant science publishing. But has Peer Review always been as challenging as it is nowadays? Some might argue so, though phrases such as 'Publish or Perish', or the 'Impact Factor rat race' are relatively new additions to a Researcher's vocabulary. Moreover, the frequently observed focus of science policies on short-term goals and the publication speed enabled or even imposed by our information age are all new variables. Worryingly, advances in online handling systems have actually enabled author and reviewer misconduct, as in the recent case of 101 papers that went through fake peer review according to the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [1]. This scenery is by no means comparable to the scientific landscape of 1960s when regular Peer Review was first introduced by journals [2, 3]. Although several changes have been introduced to the Peer Review system to address current challenges, the Peer Review Process has been until recently preserved in its primary version: metadata on Peer Review efficiency have been scarcely available; implementation of emerging technologies to detect issues such as inappropriate statistical analysis, figure manipulation and data fabrication has been limited; Peer Reviewers lack systematic training on conducting constructive and ethical peer review; and incentives for performing high-quality peer review are often scarce. However, this scenery is now changing, and the first steps towards Peer Review modernization have already been made! The realization that systematic research on Peer Review needs to be conducted is growing. Already in July 2017, Carole J. Lee and David Moher, philosophers specializing in Publication Science at the University of Washington and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, respectively, published in Science a call for promoting scientific integrity via research on Peer Review [4]. Lee and Moher call Publishers to enable the opening of what they name 'the black box of peer review'. They highlight the need for large systematic experimental studies to assess the various peer review practices and improve quality and transparency. Going a step further, they present incentives for Publishers to adopt new software systems for assisting Peer Review, evaluating Peer Review Efficiency and producing metadata on, for example, reviewer scores and comments linked to manuscript content, or reviewer expertise and affiliations. The suggested incentives are hard to ignore: taking into consideration the persisting plea to de-emphasize impact factor, as well as the need to exclude predatory journals, introduction of indicators for Peer Review transparency will soon gain momentum. The wide application of indicators for Peer Review transparency would provide strong incentives for a Publishers' initiative to support research that improves the quality of the Peer Review process. Such a collective initiative could even be supported through updating the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines to facilitate journal meta-research. One might argue that this is yet another idealistic call. However, reality might disprove them. The upcoming International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication, which was launched by JAMA and BMJ back in 1986 to encourage systematic research on Peer Review [5, 6], features a rich programme on metadata analysis, and will host several journal editors and publisher representatives. This is only an indication that the community is responsive to the general need for metadata analysis of Peer Review. In addition, the implementation of Open Peer Review by several publishers increases metadata availability. Through Open Peer Review the identities of both Authors and Reviewers are made public upon manuscript acceptance, often along with the Peer Review reports. EMBO Press journals and Nature Communications publish reviewer reports along with manuscripts on an optional basis [7, 8]. Similarly, BMJ [9], F1000Research [10] and about 70 journals from BioMed Central [11], all use variable models of Open Peer Review but share a common feature: they publish reviewer reports and names alongside the published article. In addition, Publishers are engaging in lively discussions on the future of Peer Review. For example, in 2016, BioMed Central and Digital Science organized a 1-day conference, the SpotOn London event, at which participants actively discussed 'what peer review might look like in 2030'. This event led to the production of an informative report [12], and will hopefully help trigger more discussions, when repeated later this year. In parallel, Chris Graf, Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics Director at Wiley, has recently indicated openness to change: 'our plan at Wiley […] includes continuous work […] to collect and record data on trends [and] Editorial initiatives and experiments designed to improve transparency and openness, and thus reproducibility. We are pleased to be an organizational signatory to the TOP guidelines. We publish several journals – the European Journal of Neuroscience in particular – that are leading proponents for 'two-stage' peer review adopted in the Registered Reports model. We will continue to encourage and support journals that experiment with this model, and others like it' [13]. So, it seems that publishers are ready for a change. Most importantly, they are not alone in this effort. Policy makers also seem to recognize the need for systematic research on Peer Review. For example, the EU has initiated the COST Action 'PEERE: New frontiers of peer review'. PEERE is a multidisciplinary international project running from 2014 to 2018 that involves quantitative and qualitative research on how peer review is conducted, seeking to make evidence-based recommendations for improving the current system. Thorough Peer Review seems to obstruct fast publication and vice versa. However, when it comes to time limitations faced by both Reviewers and Journal Editors, several emerging technologies can lend a helping hand. Some Publishers have already integrated technologies to waterproof the Peer Review Process: AAAS has recently launched a new web-based service, Peer Review Evaluation (PRE), that ensures adherence to journal Peer-Review policy, excluding fake or biased reports [14]. Probably most people engaged in Publishing have heard of Crossref, a web-based tool widely used to detect plagiarism issues, among other purposes. Similar technologies already exist to screen manuscripts for statistical credibility, image integrity and, even, data fabrication. Penelope was first conceived by its creator James Harwood as a web-based tool that would assist authors to adhere to guidelines when preparing a manuscript [15]. Upon collaboration with the equator network, the startup company Penelope Research has developed a product that might transform the future of Peer Review. Penelope is presently available to Publishers for checking manuscripts during submission. The checking includes, among others, the presence of appropriate formatting, the figure and table legends, references, or ethical statements. Importantly, Penelope checks for proper statistical analysis and can identify cases in which raw data of a manuscript had been previously published elsewhere. StatReviewer has recently emerged as another promising tool to assist the review of manuscripts for statistical soundness. It uses machine learning to control adherence to widely accepted statistical and methodological guidelines, such as CONSORT 2010. StatReviewer is currently being evaluated in an initial pilot study involving four clinical BioMed Central journals [16]. Would these developments mean that we are heading towards a fully automated Peer-Review system? As Chadwick C. DeVoss, Founder and President of StatReviewer argues in the 2016 SpotOn London report, 'this is where a slippery slope gets extra slippery' [12]. A fully-automated publishing line would only undermine exchange and communication between researchers. On the contrary, the aim here is solely to implement emerging technologies as a helping tool that will leave authors and reviewers valuable time for rewarding interactions. Researchers are being thoroughly trained for conceiving a project and experimenting in a wet or dry lab. Most postgraduate students also receive regular training on writing a manuscript and preparing scientific presentations. But what about conducting Peer Review? Considering the major impact of reviewing quality on scholarly publishing, minimal concerted efforts have been so far invested on training good Reviewers. With advice mainly restricted to journal guidelines and some editorials, budding Peer Reviewers seem to be in need of more support when expected to produce a good referee report. More than that, there is still an open debate on whether young PostDocs should be given the possibility for getting some hands-on experience with Peer Review. Lack of opportunities for young scientists to train on supervised Peer Review is rather unfortunate given the fact that most are open to both expanding their expertise and investing time on a scientific exchange as rewarding as Peer Review. Yet, both individual journal initiatives and a new platform dedicated to Peer Review have set the goal of changing this scenery. For example, the Genetics Society of America has just initiated a pilot programme for training reviewers on the 'principles, purposes, and best practices of Peer Review'. Other Publishers opt for providing online packages with Peer Review training Material, including Webinars, as is the case with the Wiley Peer Review training. Going one step further, Publons, a platform focusing on Peer Review and aimed at Authors, Reviewers, Editors and Publishers alike, has developed the Publons Academy, a practical Peer Review training course for early career researchers. Publons Academy not only provides extensive material on evaluating novelty, methods, results, conclusions and ethical integrity in a manuscript but also enables supervised postpublication Peer Review. Experienced Reviewers are encouraged to sign up as supervisors and get acknowledged for this role. Acknowledgement is actually the groundbreaking component that has already earned Publons a constantly growing community of Reviewers, Editors and Journals. Reviewers get credit for every single report they prepare (even when the manuscript does not get accepted for publication). This sole fact is crucial for transforming Peer Review: as indicated in a survey conducted by Wiley, four of five researchers agree that reviewing is not sufficiently acknowledged by journals and research institutions [17]. With the ambition to transform this landscape, Publons provides credit, in the form of a verified peer review record, that can be considered as credential during internal institute evaluations, or at job and grant applications. The provision of such incentives may help to build a universal reviewer database. Such a database would assist journals to expand their pool of Reviewers that currently seems to be biased towards senior, male, American and European researchers, and is by no means representative of the current researcher and author demographics. Several developments occurring in parallel seem to steer towards a brand new future for the Peer-Review process. Whether this is an optimistic or realistic view, we are all to find out soon. But what are the actual views of researchers on burning questions about Peer Review transparency, quality and recognition? In times of change, it is essential for the main players to become vocal and put forward criticism and suggestions for solution. How do Reviewers view models of open Peer Review to ensure transparency? Do Authors and Reviewers welcome the use of emerging technologies as a part of the peer review process for the sake of faster publication? What do they consider as nonreplaceable values of nonautomated Peer Review? Do Authors profit from Peer Review more than is generally admitted and acknowledged? How do early career investigators feel about their inclusion in this system? Are senior researchers that have experienced the evolution of the Peer Review System over the past 20 years prepared to supervise younger colleagues? The debate is still on, and the more views available, the more can the system improve.

AB  - 최근 학술커뮤니케이션에 나타난 변화 중 괄목할 만한 것이 '오픈액세스(Open Access)인데, 세계적으로 정보공유를 위한 연구자들의 참여와 학계와 정부에서의 지원 정책 발표가 이어면서 서구를 중심으로 급속히 확산되고 있다. 정보공유에 있어서 가장 중요한 것은 정보의 생산자이면서 소비자인 연구자들의 참여의지와 인식이다. 따라서 연구성과 정보의 공유에 대한 인식 조사는 대단히 긴요하다. 본 조사는 특정 주제 분야의 연구자들을 대상으로 오픈액세스 환경에 대한 인식도를 조사하였다. 이 조사를 바탕으로 오픈액세스 환경에서 이슈가 되고 있는 저작권 문제를 조명하였다. 결과적으로 국내 연구자들에게 있어서 '오픈액세스'에 대한 인식은 아직은 미비한 것으로 나타난 반면, 저작권이 침해되지 않는 범위 내에서 명확한 출처를 밝히고 합법적인 목적으로 연구물을 사용한다면 오픈액세스 활동에 참여할 의사를 가지고 있는 것으로 조사되었다. 이러한 결과를 바탕으로 이 논문에서는 저작권과 라이선스의 마련, 그리고 산재한 연구성과물의 원활한 관리와 접근 및 활용을 극대화시킬 수 있는 연구정보관리 체제의 구축이 필요함을 밝혔다. The purpose of this study is to scrutinize the copyright issue under Open Access environment. A survey has been carried out to investigate researchers' awareness and recognitions about such issues. For this, bioinformatics researchers were selected and surveyed. Descriptive statistics method is employed for analysis of collected data. The findings of this study summarized as follow. (1) Although the researchers regarded the Open Access a positive initiative, the perceptions about open access were very low. (2) The researchers demanded possession of copyright depending on type of research information. (3) Many agencies did not required the transfer of copyright to the researcher. Thus, there is a possibility of dispute regarding copyright issues between researchers and agencies. (4) The researchers are willing to participate in open access activity on the assumption that their study is used in legitimate objective. On the basis of these findings, suggestions are added in as an impetus to lower the barrier against a copyright and higher the approach to information seekers and information providers.

AB  - Abstract Pillars of open science are often included within the editorial policies of scholarly journals, including policies on open access publication, availability of underlying research data, preprints and open peer review. The aim of this paper is to examine and analyse perceptions and editorial practices related to open access, preprints, open research data and open peer review, from the perspective of editors of scientific journals published in Spain, to gain an insight into editorial policies related to open science. Results and data were obtained by a combined method of online interviews and an online questionnaire. The online survey was sent to editors from journals indexed in the Dulcinea directory, which at the time of the study included 1875 academic journals. A total of 420 responses (22.4%) were obtained. The results indicated that 92% of the journals were open access journals, 2% of the journals conducted open peer review, 15% of the journals had instructions to allow archiving preprints, and out of 375 responses, only 59 journals (16%) reported having a policy on underlying research data. Based on these results, there is a trend in favour of open access, but the perceived barriers to open peer review outweighed the advantages. There is also some reluctance to allow preprints to be made available. This concern might be because editors want authors and readers to read and cite the contents published in their journals, rather than their preprint versions.

AB  - <h3></h3> Sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV researchers publish in scholarly journals to disseminate their work. The scholarly publishing industry has transformed beyond recognition in the past 20 years with the advent of the Internet. Not only have methods of dissemination of scholarly work changed, in addition there has been a proliferation of many different aspects of publishing, with innovations in the types of material considered as academic output, changes in peer review, and business models and new opportunities for engagement post publication. At the same time there have been fundamental changes in much of the infrastructure of publishing, including author identity, versioning of articles and linking within and between articles. We are at a critical point in the opening up of access to the literature and what happens next will determine whether it really does become a global, and not just a developed world, public good. Skirmishes around some of these innovations have distracted from this vital debate. It is crucial for the next phase in scholarly publishing that everyone involved – be it authors, reviewers or editors -–&nbsp;engages with this exciting debate to ensure that publishing STI and HIV research serves their needs.

AB  - Objective – Our article examines the effects of Quebec’s provincial funding agency (FRQ)’s revised 2022 OA policy on researchers. Following FRQ’s participation as a cOAlition S funding agency, which involves endorsing Plan S principles, we provide an overview of the OA options for researchers. We examine these options under the FRQ 2019 and FRQ 2022 policy years, account for the effect of transformative agreements (TA) on OA publishing options, as well as the financial implications for researchers under the revised policy. Methods – The researchers extracted a list of FRQ-funded publications from years 2020 to 2022 using the DOI registration agency Crossref. Using this sample set, the researchers quantitatively analyzed OA options under the previous policy and the revised one, comparing the two. To determine the effect of transformative agreements (TAs)s, we reviewed current agreements offered through Canada’s national licensing agency Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN). Results ­– We found that the self-archiving method for open access (OA) is reduced under the revised 2022 policy. Our results lead us to anticipate the pressure felt by authors who will be required to pay article processing charges (APCs) to meet grant requirements. Conclusion – The current publishing patterns of FRQ-funded researchers are primarily concentrated in hybrid journals not covered by transformative agreements. As such, researchers will face additional financial costs should these publishing patterns continue. Concerted efforts among all stakeholders (researchers, universities, libraries, and funders) are needed to sustainably transition to immediate OA.

AB  - This study aimed to clarify the present position of Ultrasonography in the scholarly journal network with a variety of bibliometric indicators. Furthermore, developmental strategies for Ultrasonography to become a top-tier journal are suggested.The following bibliometric indicators were analyzed: number of citable articles, countries of authors, total cites, impact factor, Hirsch index, authors' countries and source titles of citing articles, and the titles of sources cited by articles in Ultrasonography.The annual number of citable articles was consistently 40 from 2014 to 2019. The number of countries of authors increased to 22 in 2018-2019. The numbers of total cites reached 632 in Web of Science, 595 in Scopus, and 552 in the Crossref metadata in 2019. The estimated 2-year impact factor soared from 2.15 in 2016 to 3.20 in 2019. The Hirsch index was 20 in both Scopus and the Web of Science Core Collection. Authors from 76 countries cited Ultrasonography. The number of source titles of citing articles was 668, and the number of source titles cited by articles in Ultrasonography was 1,246.The above bibliometric results show that Ultrasonography has become a top-tier journal in its field. Ultrasonography furnishes an example of how after changing its language policy to English-only, a local society journal became a highly cited journal in a short period of time. For further development of the journal, adoption of a data-sharing policy is recommended. Furthermore, indexation in MEDLINE should be pursued in the near future.

AB  - The Internet has transformed scholarly publishing, most notably, by the introduction of open access publishing. Recently, there has been a rise of online journals characterized as ‘predatory’, which actively solicit manuscripts and charge publications fees without providing robust peer review and editorial services. We carried out a cross-sectional comparison of characteristics of potential predatory, legitimate open access, and legitimate subscription-based biomedical journals. On July 10, 2014, scholarly journals from each of the following groups were identified – potential predatory journals (source: Beall’s List), presumed legitimate, fully open access journals (source: PubMed Central), and presumed legitimate subscription-based (including hybrid) journals (source: Abridged Index Medicus). MEDLINE journal inclusion criteria were used to screen and identify biomedical journals from within the potential predatory journals group. One hundred journals from each group were randomly selected. Journal characteristics (e.g., website integrity, look and feel, editors and staff, editorial/peer review process, instructions to authors, publication model, copyright and licensing, journal location, and contact) were collected by one assessor and verified by a second. Summary statistics were calculated. Ninety-three predatory journals, 99 open access, and 100 subscription-based journals were analyzed; exclusions were due to website unavailability. Many more predatory journals’ homepages contained spelling errors (61/93, 66%) and distorted or potentially unauthorized images (59/93, 63%) compared to open access journals (6/99, 6% and 5/99, 5%, respectively) and subscription-based journals (3/100, 3% and 1/100, 1%, respectively). Thirty-one (33%) predatory journals promoted a bogus impact metric – the Index Copernicus Value – versus three (3%) open access journals and no subscription-based journals. Nearly three quarters (n = 66, 73%) of predatory journals had editors or editorial board members whose affiliation with the journal was unverified versus two (2%) open access journals and one (1%) subscription-based journal in which this was the case. Predatory journals charge a considerably smaller publication fee (median $100 USD, IQR $63–$150) than open access journals ($1865 USD, IQR $800–$2205) and subscription-based hybrid journals ($3000 USD, IQR $2500–$3000). We identified 13 evidence-based characteristics by which predatory journals may potentially be distinguished from presumed legitimate journals. These may be useful for authors who are assessing journals for possible submission or for others, such as universities evaluating candidates’ publications as part of the hiring process.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the practices of Pakistani academic researchers with respect to using, citing, and publishing their scholarly work. The quantitative survey method adopted to collect data from local researchers was based on an instrument developed and used by CIBER. Their notions and practices involved in deciding trust and quality of scholarly journals were obtained. The findings revealed that national and institutional policies have significantly influenced their decisions regarding the publishing outlets. The credibility of indexing services was found to be an important factor in choosing the journal for publishing research. ISI Web of Science Impact Factor was not considered as the top source for determining quality and trustworthiness. This study is the first of its kind that targets the top two universities of the country. A comparison of the findings with another international study shows that some of the behavioural traits are compatible with scholars from less-developed countries like India and China, while others are more similar to the ones from highly developed countries like USA and UK.

AB  - The rise of predatory journals and the dubious methods they use to attract researchers to publish in them and serve on their editorial boards is disrupting the scholarly publishing landscape. It is increasingly difficult to distinguish between legitimate and predatory articles and journals. Two views of this challenging landscape were presented during NASIG’s 34th Annual Conference. Marydee Ojala, a former academic/corporate librarian and currently editor of a magazine for librarians, outlined dangers such as pirated versions of scholarly articles and concerns that the inclusion of inaccurate and incoherent “sting” articles in Open Access journals has soured the general public’s attitude towards scientific expertise. In a “fake news” world, debasing scholarly research is a potent threat to academic disciplines and to libraries. Regina Reynolds, the head of the U.S ISSN Center, recounted the experiences of ISSN staff on the front lines of dealing with the full range of new publishers and explored the broader questions raised by the predatory publishing phenomenon. Libraries, academia, traditional publishers, and others need to continue grappling with their roles and responsibilities regarding this new reality.

AB  - SUMMARY Open access publishing has a dark side, the predatory publishers and journals that exist for revenue rather than scholarly activity. This article helps researchers to: (1) identify some of the commonly used tactics and characteristics of predatory publishing; and (2) avoid falling prey to them. In summary, authors should choose the journal for submission themselves and never respond to unsolicited emails. It is also important to check blacklists such as ‘Stop Predatory Journals’ and whitelists such the Directory of Open Access Journals. LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this article, readers should be able to do the following: • be aware of the dangers of predatory journals and publishers • use blacklists of predatory journals and publishers’ whitelists of legitimate open access journals • be aware of warning signs that might suggest a predatory journal or publisher. DECLARATION OF INTEREST S.K. is on the editorial board of BJPsych International . He also receives five to ten spam emails a day from predatory journals and publishers.

AB  - Abstract Predatory journals are a blemish on scholarly publishing and academia and the studies published within them are more likely to contain data that is false. The inclusion of studies from predatory journals in evidence syntheses is potentially problematic due to this propensity for false data to be included. To date, there has been little exploration of the opinions and experiences of evidence synthesisers when dealing with predatory journals in the conduct of their evidence synthesis. In this paper, the thoughts, opinions, and attitudes of evidence synthesisers towards predatory journals and the inclusion of studies published within these journals in evidence syntheses were sought. Focus groups were held with participants who were experienced evidence synthesisers from JBI (previously the Joanna Briggs Institute) collaboration. Utilising qualitative content analysis, two generic categories were identified: predatory journals within evidence synthesis, and predatory journals within academia. Our findings suggest that evidence synthesisers believe predatory journals are hard to identify and that there is no current consensus on the management of these studies if they have been included in an evidence synthesis. There is a critical need for further research, education, guidance, and development of clear processes to assist evidence synthesisers in the management of studies from predatory journals.

AB  - Nowadays the world of scholarly publishing is in serious trouble because of the increasing number of predatory publishing. Besides, citation of articles from predatory journals is also unethical that undermines the quality of research papers. Because of ignorance of predatory publishing and/or compulsion of getting published in a limited time, scholars from Universities and young researchers become victim to predatory or hijacked journals. The purpose of this paper is to create awareness among authors, especially novice ones, about predatory publication. Research institutions should encourage their researchers to publish their articles in valuable journals indexed in Web of Science's Journal Citation Reports (JCR), Clarivate Analytics, formerly part of Thomson-Reuters) or other famous scientific databases such as Scopus, PubMed and MEDLINE. In this way, attention to the Thomson Reuters’ Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and Journal Ranking (JRK) and Scopus grade (Q1, Q2 and Q3) may be useful and necessary.

AB  - AbstractThe escalation in open-access publishing has fueled the rise of questionable businesses, namely, ‘predatory’ journals. Predatory journals and their publishers seek manuscripts through aggressive electronic solicitation and execute flawed peer-review practices, consequently undermining the scholarly record and current research cultures, globally. As these journals are not indexed in any legitimate databases, the research they publish is often undiscoverable and fails to be disseminated to a worldwide readership. Acknowledging this threat to the credibility of science, this article aims to alert researchers at various levels of their career of the increasing global issue of predatory journals, and offer helpful advice and resources for identifying and avoiding them.

AB  - A negative consequence of the rapid growth of scholarly open access publishing funded by article processing charges is the emergence of publishers and journals with highly questionable marketing and peer review practices. These so-called predatory publishers are causing unfounded negative publicity for open access publishing in general. Reports about this branch of e-business have so far mainly concentrated on exposing lacking peer review and scandals involving publishers and journals. There is a lack of comprehensive studies about several aspects of this phenomenon, including extent and regional distribution. After an initial scan of all predatory publishers and journals included in the so-called Beall’s list, a sample of 613 journals was constructed using a stratified sampling method from the total of over 11,000 journals identified. Information about the subject field, country of publisher, article processing charge and article volumes published between 2010 and 2014 were manually collected from the journal websites. For a subset of journals, individual articles were sampled in order to study the country affiliation of authors and the publication delays. Over the studied period, predatory journals have rapidly increased their publication volumes from 53,000 in 2010 to an estimated 420,000 articles in 2014, published by around 8,000 active journals. Early on, publishers with more than 100 journals dominated the market, but since 2012 publishers in the 10–99 journal size category have captured the largest market share. The regional distribution of both the publisher’s country and authorship is highly skewed, in particular Asia and Africa contributed three quarters of authors. Authors paid an average article processing charge of 178 USD per article for articles typically published within 2 to 3 months of submission. Despite a total number of journals and publishing volumes comparable to respectable (indexed by the Directory of Open Access Journals) open access journals, the problem of predatory open access seems highly contained to just a few countries, where the academic evaluation practices strongly favor international publication, but without further quality checks.

AB  - Predatory journals pose a global threat to science. Young scientists and scholars are easy victims of the predatory publications. Predatory publications reduce the accuracy, reliability, and validity of the scientific works published. The predatory publications are worthless, just a waste of time, resources, money, and efforts. Predatory publications undermine the value of legitimate publications. In order to discourage predatory publications, educational and research institutions should set the rules for publication in the journals that must be indexed in web of science, Journal Citation Reports (JCR, Clarivate Analytics, formerly Thomson-Reuters) or other famous scientific databases such as Scopus, DOAJ, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Citation of articles from predatory journals should be discouraged. The students, academics, and researchers should be careful to avoid predatory publications to maintain their credentials.

AB  - Open access publishing enables scholarship to be openly accessible to everyone, which has countless benefits. However, the open access movement has opened the door for “predatory publishers” to take advantage of researchers surviving in this publish or perish academic landscape. Predatory journals are becoming increasingly common. Nursing researchers, instructors, and students need to be made aware of the dangers of predatory journals, and they need to know how to identify them. While there are blacklists and whitelists that can be used to aid in decision-making, it is critical to note that these lists can never be entirely up to date. This article incorporates a literature review which provides insights into newer trends in predatory and unethical publishing, including “journal hijacking” and “bogus impact factors”. Extensive criteria for assessing emerging or unknown journals is compiled to aid researchers, students, educators, and the public in evaluating open access publications.

AB  - Introduction The advent of open access publishing has allowed for unrestricted and rapid knowledge dissemination and can generate higher citation levels. However, the establishment of predatory journals exploits this model and may lead to publication of non-peer reviewed work. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the characteristics and trends of indexed publications in paediatric urology. The primary outcomes were to compare open access vs non-open access publishing. The secondary outcome was to assess whether any open access publications in this cohort could be classified as predatory based on journal data basing and external peer review policies. Methods PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase reviews were carried out for any publication using the terms ‘p(a)ediatric urology’ over a 5-year period (October 2012–2017). These publications were individually accessed, assessed for relevance and cross-checked using the ISI Web of Knowledge Journal Citation Report. Bibliometric data, journal type and access model were all individually assessed, ranked and compared using descriptive and non-parametric statistical methods. Results From an initial total of 4075 indexed publications, 2244 journal publications across 51 countries were included based on relevance, of which 611 were open access. Open access journals were significantly more likely to publish basic science/laboratory versus clinical publications (10.9% vs 3.3%). They were more likely have higher average citations/publication (17 vs. 8), but there was no difference between open and closed journal impact factors (3.1 vs. 2.7). The overall rate of open access, indexed publications that were not peer reviewed and/or included in open access databases was 6.5% Discussion The overall numbers of paediatric urological articles appearing on PubMed between 2012 and 2017 have increased by approximately 75%, while the number of open access articles has remained relatively static (25%). Researchers may prefer to publish in specific journals to disseminate results to a particular audience or fear in the current climate that an open access journal may not be considered legitimate, and possibly even predatory, thus having a negative impact on the data and the author's reputation. The impact factor status and route/method of publication may be less important.

AB  - Background.Scholarly communication is an ever-evolving practice.As publishing advanced from the printed format to digital formats, new trends, practices and platforms emerged in academia.As reputable publishers adapted their business models to accommodate open access, many non-reputable publishers have emerged with questionable business models and less-thanfavourable or unacceptable publishing services.Objectives.This paper discusses changing trends in scholarly publishing, the advent of and problems caused by pervasive predatory publishing practices, and possible solutions.The paper also investigates possible alternatives to Beall's list and whether a "one-stop shop" black-or white list would serve as a comprehensive tool for scholarly authors.Results.The paper concludes that there is no "one-stop shop" or comprehensive resource or guidelines available at this stage for scholarly authors to consult before publishing.It alerts scholars to be cautious and to do research about potential publishers, before submitting manuscripts for publication.

AB  - Predatory publishing is currently a critical problem for researchers, particularly with the continuous rise of online journals and the increasing challenge of distinguishing between journals that can be trusted and those which should be avoided. This article begins by providing an overview of predatory publishing, focusing specifically on its definition and impacts and the prevailing predatory practices current in scientific publications. Next, the article discusses how researchers can avoid publishing with predatory publishers. We recommend that researchers do not rely solely on watchlists, rather that they develop their own skills to enable them to detect predatory practices. Finally, the article provides some practical recommendations and resources for researchers to use to assess journals as publishing venues.

AB  - Open-access is a model for publishing scholarly, peer-reviewed journals on the Internet that relies on sources of funding other than subscription fees. Some publishers and editors have exploited the author-pays model of open-access, publishing for their own profit. Submissions are encouraged through widely distributed e-mails on behalf of a growing number of journals that may accept many or all submissions and subject them to little, if any, peer review or editorial oversight. Bogus conference invitations are distributed in a similar fashion. The results of these less than ethical practices might include loss of faculty member time and money, inappropriate article inclusions in curriculum vitae, and costs to the college or funding source.

AB  - Relatively little has been said about the opportunities and challenges of digital, open access publishing as it pertains to postgraduate-led journals catering to postgraduate researchers.This paper draws on the authors’ experiences with Postgraduate English,&amp;nbsp;one of the longest-running, born-digital journals for postgraduate researchers in English studies. It makes the case for the benefit of such publications within the prestige economy and describes the ways in which quality can be assured, challenging those who might see postgraduate publications as further diluting the pool of high-quality research. At the same time, the paper raises critical questions about who really wins in postgraduate publishing. While those who publish and edit can benefit from the prestige indication of these activities, ultimately host institutions may gain more from the relationship via the hidden labour costs behind such activity.

AB  - ABSTRACT The article processing charge (APC) is currently the primary method of funding professionally published open access (OA) peer‐reviewed journals. The pricing principles of 77 OA publishers publishing over 1,000 journals using APCs were studied and classified. The most commonly used pricing method is a single fixed fee, which can either be the same for all of a publisher's journals or individually determined for each journal. Fees are usually only levied for publication of accepted papers, but there are some journals that also charge submission fees. Instead of fixed prices, many publishers charge by the page or have multi‐tiered fees depending on the length of articles. The country of origin of the author can also influence the pricing, in order to facilitate publishing for authors from developing countries.

AB  - With this Forum contribution I wish to shed light on the problematic developments in scientific publishing resulting from the strong push of science funders towards gold open access (OA). This has given rise to numerous “predatory” journals, that maximise profit at the expense of scientific quality. With a bibliometric analysis in the field of ecology I demonstrate that over the period 2014–2022 the publication numbers in “predatory” OA journals have grown exponentially (+44% annually), while in all other journal types, article numbers were stagnating or even decreasing since a few years. Then I highlight how different OA publication models from society-owned journals to publisher-owned “predatory” journals, differ in the prices authors pay and how the income is split between effective costs, pure profit and money transferred back to science. To help with the recognition of the different journal types, I provide a list journals in the fields of ecology and organismal botany that are owned by academic societies, as well as a list of criteria to recognize “predatory” journals. Authors, reviewers and editors should consider carefully where they submit papers or provide volunteer service. My suggestion is to prioritize society-owned journals, while avoiding cooperation with “predatory” journals. Science funders and libraries have played a major role in the negative developments reviewed in this paper, but at the same time they have the capacity to change the course, mainly by two steps: In the short term they should link the payment of article processing charges (APCs) to strict quality criteria, while in the medium term, they should overcome the gold OA system towards a diamond OA system that would avoid the inflation of low-quality publications and remove barriers not only from readers, but also from authors, while at the same time likely reducing the overall costs.

AB  - no definition, no defence." 1 The collaborative effort, which was co-authored by a record 35 authors from scientific, technical, and medical publishers around the world, was illustrated by an eye-catching piece of art based on the primeval myth of deceptive appearances -a sinister-looking wolf in sheep's clothing.In the illustration, the "clothing" that the wolf uses as its camouflage is an open academic journal with a sheep on its cover.That article raised the alarm about a phenomenon that the researchers, who represented fields of research, education, libraries, publishing, and research funding, consider a "global threat." 1 Scholarly publication is, like science, a paradigm, or way of seeing, organizing, and representing reality.Scholarly publishing across the disciplines is comprised of specialized, self-regulating "fields" of knowledge production, processing, curation, archiving, and retrieval. 2Scholarly publication is part of the knowledge production-and-creation paradigm of research and publication.Predatory journals are considered the tares of this paradigm.Predatory publishers and journals first caught the attention of the scientific community in 2008 when Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado-Denver, coined the term to characterize a small number of open access journals and publishers that he included on a blacklist he had published on his website.Predatory journals are considered a bane to the field because they do not care for tried and true publication standards.They ride roughshod over publication ethics in order to monetize academic publication and make a quick buck.The term, "predatory journal" or "predatory publisher" has become a contemptuous, denunciative, and exclusionary epithet that members

AB  - Despite continued attention, finding adequate criteria for distinguishing "good" from "bad" scholarly journals remains an elusive goal. In this essay, I propose a solution informed by the work of Imre Lakatos and his methodology of scientific research programmes (MSRP). I begin by reviewing several notable attempts at appraising journal quality - focusing primarily on the impact factor and development of journal blacklists and whitelists. In doing so, I note their limitations and link their overarching goals to those found within the philosophy of science. I argue that Lakatos's MSRP and specifically his classifications of "progressive" and "degenerative" research programmes can be analogized and repurposed for the evaluation of scholarly journals. I argue that this alternative framework resolves some of the limitations discussed above and offers a more considered evaluation of journal quality - one that helps account for the historical evolution of journal-level publication practices and attendant contributions to the growth (or stunting) of scholarly knowledge. By doing so, the seeming problem of journal demarcation is diminished. In the process I utilize two novel tools (the mistake index and scite index) to further illustrate and operationalize aspects of the MSRP.

AB  - Knowledge, as a prerequisite for development, is contingent on information. The main value of information is in its ability to be used, reused, and shared. Open access (OA) allows for the easy dissemination and preservation of information by providing all scholarly communication and knowledge at no cost to the end user. In the rapidly expanding, global knowledge-based economy, Africa’s steady progress from the peripheral to the epicenter of knowledge production is not to be ignored, not least because of its reliance on OA. Such access environments and institutional repositories throughout the continent are playing significant roles in maximizing the impact of research output. This paper reveals that OA content is more citable, not simply because of the quality of the output, but instead of the advantage that OA brings in maximizing accessibility and increased citation. It goes on to show that OA will enhance the research community’s existing system for evaluating and rewarding research productivity. Ultimately, OA has the ability to elevate (South) Africa, its universities and institutions, to the status of knowledge producers rather than mere knowledge consumers.

AB  - In this article, we provide a toolbox of recommendations and resources for those aspiring to promote the uptake of open scientific practices. Open Science encompasses a range of behaviours that aim to improve the transparency of scientific research. This paper is divided into seven sections, each devoted to different groups or institutions in the research ecosystem: colleagues, students, departments and faculties, universities, academic libraries, journals, and funders. We describe the behavioural influences and incentives for each of these stakeholders as well as changes they can make to foster Open Science. Our primary goal, however, is to suggest actions that researchers can take to promote these behaviours, inspired by simple principles of behaviour change: make it easy, social, and attractive. In isolation, a small shift in one person’s behaviour may appear to make little difference, but when combined, many shifts can radically alter shared norms and culture. We offer this toolbox to assist individuals and institutions in cultivating a more open research culture.

AB  - We are now in an age when the development and sustainability of our society depend critically on research and innovation. At the same time, we are facing the rapid growth of digital knowledge, ubiquitous internet, and open innovation in diverse fields. Open access to scientific knowledge can take the full advantages of the digital and internet revolution, and ensure effective implementation of strategies of innovation-driven development. AsPremierLiKeqiang emphasized at the 2014AnnualMeeting of the Global Research Council held in Beijing on 27 May 2014, ‘Science is the driving force for development, and scientific knowledge should be available to all. Amore open platform will enable everyone to share scientific knowledge, and this will contribute to the inclusive development that benefits all’. China’s R&D thrives on knowledge obtained around the world. As China is advancing towards a top-tier position in the world’s research output, open access will improve the verifiability, reproducibility, and impact of research itself. It will also create a stronger base for effective research collaboration, especially in projects that aim to meet interdisciplinary, translational, and strategic challenges. More importantly, open access provides a new public knowledge base that enables generation of new knowledge through data mining, supporting innovative research on all fronts. With open access, knowledge is no longer confined within the library collections or databases accessible to the privileged few, thus becomingpowerful innovative instruments for all.This is especially true for China. According to theChinese Statistics Yearbook for Science and Technology 2013, there are more than 3600 R&D institutions, 47 000 R&D-active enterprises, and 200 high-tech industrial development zones. Adding to this, there are 610million internet users by the end of 2013. Imagine the possibilities when all internet users have easy access to and can play with all scientific knowledge over the network! Open access helps us to liberate knowledge from labs, journals, and libraries into anopen knowledge laboratory for all, tomobilize innovation capabilities, to enable big data-driven research, and to stimulate user-driven and market-oriented innovation, thus ensuring the greatest return on investment for publicly funded research. Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has been promoting open access to knowledge all the time. In May of 2014, CAS issued its open access policy, requiring allCAS researchers todeposit their peer-reviewed research articles resulting fromall public funding into their respective institutional repositories (IRs), and to provide public access within 12 months of publication. More than 100 CAS institutes now have their IRs, with more than 440 thousand full-text research papers deposited and 6.9 million downloads registered in 2013 alone, making the CAS IR system one of the largest in the world. This is further facilitated by the CAS support to authors publishing in open access journals. And, there are more than 170 open access journals published by CAS, among 600 such journals in China, according to Chinese Science and Technology Association. Chinese scientific communities are working together for open access. TheMinistry of Science and Technology (MoST) has launched its Scientific Reports Public Sharing Systemwhere MoST-funded projects are required to deposit their final reports with open access. Through its National Science and TechnologyLibrary system,MoSTalso supportsChina’s participation in the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics, through which about half of the research papers in high energy physics are now open access immediately after publication. In May of 2014, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) also issued its open access policy requiring open access deposit of research articles resulting from its funding. This is just the beginning.More steps are required inChina to ensure effective, affordable, and sustainable open access. One is to develop operational means for enforceable implementation of the open access deposit requirements of CAS, NSFC, and the like. Another is to develop economical mechanisms for supporting open access publishingwhich is becoming amainstream in scholarly publishing. What is important here is to work with all stakeholders, to foster cooperation among government agencies, publishers, and scientific communities. Given the increasing pace of open access, we can envision an erawhenessentially all published research articles and a substantial portion of research data are open to all. We scientists need to prepare ourselves for this new era, and funding agencies and research institutions need to incorporate open access into their current management and future plan for knowledge infrastructure and research workflow. I trust that open access will lead to new approaches in research and innovation, and will open new horizons in science, technology, and social development.

AB  - Abstract Open access (OA) journals distribute their content at no charge and use other means of funding the publication process. Publication fees or article‐processing charges (APC)s have become the predominant means for funding professional OA publishing. We surveyed 1,038 authors who recently published articles in 74 OA journals that charge APCs stratified into seven discipline categories. Authors were asked about the source of funding for the APC, factors influencing their choice of a journal and past history publishing in OA and subscription journals. Additional information about the journal and the authors' country were obtained from the journal website. A total of 429 (41%) authors from 69 journals completed the survey. There were large differences in the source of funding among disciplines. Journals with impact factors charged higher APCs as did journals from disciplines where grant funding is plentiful. Fit, quality, and speed of publication were the most important factors in the authors' choice of a journal. OA was less important but a significant factor for many authors in their choice of a journal to publish. These findings are consistent with other research on OA publishing and suggest that OA publishing funded through APCs is likely to continue to grow.

AB  - Purpose A major problem in today’s scholarly publishing process is the long tails for the assignment of volume and issue numbers for approved articles. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which information science journals offer early view features and the effects of these features. Design/methodology/approach The study addresses three basic questions: Do the articles approved for publication in information science journals appear in the online platforms of these journals before the assignment of volume and issue numbers? How long do the articles wait in the online platforms before they get the volume and issue numbers? Is there a statistically significant relationship between the online accessing numbers of the articles before they are published and bibliometric indicators? Findings More than half of the information science journals complete the editorial process in reasonable durations and share new articles with their readers before publishing them. In some journals, there are articles that wait for more than a year to be assigned volume and issue numbers after the completion of the editorial process. There are statistically significant differences, in terms of both their impact factor and immediacy index values, between the journals that offer early view features and those that do not. Both the impact factor and the immediacy index values of the journals that provide early view are higher than the others. Practical implications Adopting the early view policy may significantly help increase the impact factor and immediacy index values of the journals, as well as the visibility of their contents Originality/value The answers to this study’s research questions offer a new perspective to overcome the challenges in the processes through which scientific products meet with their users.

AB  - Background Scholarly publishing system relies on external peer review. However, the duration of publication process is a major concern for authors and funding bodies. Objective To evaluate the duration of the publication process in pharmacy practice journals compared with other biomedical journals indexed in PubMed. Methods All the articles published from 2009 to 2018 by the 33 pharmacy practice journals identified in Mendes et al. study and indexed in PubMed were gathered as study group. A comparison group was created through a random selection of 3000 PubMed PMIDs for each year of study period. Articles with publication dates outside the study period were excluded. Metadata of both groups of articles were imported from PubMed. The duration of editorial process was calculated with three periods: acceptance lag (days between ‘submission date’ and ‘acceptance date’), lead lag (days between ‘acceptance date’ and ‘online publication date’), and indexing lag (days between ‘online publication date’ and ‘Entry date’). Null hypothesis significance tests and effect size measures were used to compare these periods between both groups. Results The 33 pharmacy practice journals published 26,256 articles between 2009 and 2018. Comparison group random selection process resulted in a pool of 23,803 articles published in 5,622 different journals. Acceptance lag was 105 days (IQR 57–173) for pharmacy practice journals and 97 days (IQR 56–155) for the comparison group with a null effect difference (Cohen’s d 0.081). Lead lag was 13 (IQR 6–35) and 23 days (IQR 9–45) for pharmacy practice and comparison journals, respectively, which resulted in a small effect. Indexing lag was 5 days (IQR 2–46) and 4 days (IQR 2–12) for pharmacy practice and control journals, which also resulted in a small effect. Slight positive time trend was found in pharmacy practice acceptance lag, while slight negative trends were found for lead and indexing lags for both groups. Conclusions Publication process duration of pharmacy practice journals is similar to a general random sample of articles from all disciplines.

AB  - The argument that publicly funded research should be publicly available is a valid one, but it cannot be the most important one in the discussion as to whether research should be freely accessible. The overriding argument is that freely accessible research optimises the scientific process as well as its 'translation' into societal benefits. Free access, or 'open access' as it is widely called, can be brought about by making full use of the technologies available to the world, particularly the internet, but it does need a change in traditional economic models of publishing.

AB  - In August, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a new policy requiring that all federally funded scholarly research be accessible to the public immediately upon publication. While this open access policy will ultimately benefit society by increasing the availability of data and research outputs, it could place a heavy burden on researchers due to the relatively high cost of open access alongside an academic culture that tends to favor publishing in high impact subscription journals. We examine the complexities of the traditional publishing landscape and offer recommendations for agencies, universities, and publishers to mitigate the impacts on researchers. Specifically, we recommend a short-term increase in funding to cover higher publishing costs, but contributions from all stakeholders are needed to facilitate a long-term solution.

C1  - Cactus Communications, Mumbai, India
AB  - Scientific researchers around the world are increasingly publishing in English. In parallel, local or regional scientific journals are also perhaps increasingly becoming English periodicals. I congratulate the editors of Science Editing for their efforts to bring this journal to the international stage by publishing articles in English. Nowadays, researchers who are non-native English speakers often recognize that they need some kind of assistance with the English language to become successful communicators of their work. Similarly, non-native English speaking (NNES) journal editors who wish to start publishing their journals in English may also benefit from more awareness of the language aspect of publishing. This article is aimed at NNES journal editors who wish to improve the standard of English in their journals.

AB  - This study investigated the publishing patterns of information science academics in Kenya. Using a bibliometric approach, the author conducted an analysis of the quantity, quality and visibility of the publications indexed by Google Scholar. Data for the analysis was collected using Harzing’s “Publish or Perish” software from Google Scholar and presented using VOSviewer software. The findings of the study revealed low quantity, quality and visibility of research publications by information science academics in Kenya. Twenty (22.4%) serving academics are yet to publish any scholarly work. Similarly, 185 (42%) of the published papers have not been cited. This low publishing performance can be attributed to lack of scholarly communication skills; inadequate research funding and facilitation; limited access to scholarly communication channels; and heavy teaching workloads, among other factors. The quantity, quality and visibility of publications by information science academics in Kenya can be enhanced by training the lecturers on scholarly communication; accrediting journals and publishers; increasing research funding; strengthening research collaboration; increasing scholarly forums and platforms; and balancing lecturers’ teaching and research workloads.

AB  - At a time of great dynamism among publishers of scientific publications, with the inevitability of Open Access and the ease of publishing online at low cost, it is possible to find publications with different levels of scientific respectability. In this context, the improvement of the quality of scholarly publications emerges as a critical element for publishers, authors and academic institutions, as well as for society in general. This opinion piece discusses Open Access journals with different levels of quality, focusing on the following quality-promoting measures: blacklists, author’s preparation, and institutional prevention. The analysis allows concluding that the open review will be one of the key elements in the process of clarification and promotion of the level of quality and consequent scientific respectability of each of the Journals, of the thousands currently existing, a number that is likely to increase.

AB  - Open access (OA) publishing rates have risen dramatically in the biomedical sciences in the past decade. However, few studies have focused on the publishing activities and attitudes of early career researchers. The aim of this study was to examine current publishing activities of clinical and research fellows and their perceptions of OA publishing and public access.This study employed a mixed methods approach. Data on publications authored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center fellows between 2013 and 2018 were collected via an in-house author profile system and citation indexes. Journals were categorized according to SHERPA/RoMEO classifications. In-person and telephone interviews were conducted with fifteen fellows to discern their perceptions of OA publishing.The total percentage of fellows' publications that were freely available OA was 28.6%, with a relatively flat rate between 2013 and 2018. Publications with fellows as first authors were significantly more likely to be OA. Fellows cited high article processing charges (APCs) and perceived lack of journal quality or prestige as barriers to OA publishing. Fellows generally expressed support for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) public access policy.While the fellows in this study acknowledged the potential of OA to aid in research dissemination, they also expressed hesitation to publish OA related to confusion surrounding legitimate OA and predatory publications and frustration with APCs. Fellows supported the NIH public access policy and accepted it as part of their research process. Health sciences information professionals could potentially leverage this acceptance of public access to advocate for OA publishing.

AB  - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) public access policy mandates that all articles containing NIH-funded research must be deposited into PubMed Central (PMC). The aim of this study was to assess publishing trends of journals that were not selected for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) collection but contain NIH-funded articles submitted to PMC in compliance with the public access policy. In addition, the authors investigated the degree to which NIH-funded research is published in journals that NLM does not collect due to concerns with the publishers.We analyzed bibliographic data from the NIH Manuscript Submission system for journals that were not selected for the NLM collection from August 2015 to August 2016. Publications (n=738) were analyzed by language, publishing country, publishing format, and subject, and the results were compared to a similar study of 2008-2009 data. In addition, publications were analyzed by whether their publishers are collected by NLM, as determined by transparency and adherence to publishing best practices.Only a few differences were found between the studies. Most notably, while both studies revealed that most journals were not selected for the NLM collection because they were out of scope (i.e., not biomedical), we noted an increase in 2015-2016 in biomedical journals containing NIH-funded articles that were not added to the collection due to concerns with the publishers.While the current number of NIH-funded manuscripts being published by publishers that are not collected by NLM remains quite small, we noted a substantial increase between 2008-2009 and 2015-2016.

AB  - The study based on an online survey covering 655 researchers from hard and soft sciences addresses the influence of different conditions on academic publishing. Results show that (1) hard sciences academics publish more than soft sciences; (2) there are resemblances in academic publishing; (3) there are differences in the sufficient conditions sets for the two groups of sciences which may be explained by differences in scientific conceptual frameworks and research methods applied in each group of disciplines; (4) conditions leading to the absence of publishing reveal similarities and differences among hard and soft sciences academics. The study contribute to: (1) the debate on the questionable generalization of scientific publications indexes and rankings due to the nature of research published coming from different scientific universes; (2) identify pathways for achieving higher performance in academic publishing; (3) allow research centers' managers to better manage the centers aiming to achieve upper output levels.

AB  - Publishing in peer-reviewed journals is an integral part of the conduct of modern science. The value of publishing for scientists employed in the public sector is obvious. The primary measure of research value, productivity, reputation, and credibility in the public sector is the published journal article; if you will, it is the main productivity metric of public research institutions. But we have different productivity metrics in the private sector; our primary measure of value are products and services that enter the marketplace that meet or exceed the expectations of paying customers. So, why should scientists employed by the private sector be concerned about publishing in refereed journals? After all, corporations, such as agricultural products companies, do not generate revenue from “scholarly” publishing. Publishing is not mentioned in our company’s mission, vision, or corevalues statements. Further, publishing may require considerable company resources that arguably could be directed to projects that seem to provide a real and tangible return. In this article, we build a case for the importance of publishing by private-sector scientists. We focus on the importance of publishing for business reasons but also discuss the importance of publishing for individual scientists to build their credibility and to enhance their professional development.

TI  - Publish or perish? Innovative models for scholarly publishing in Zimbabwe

AU  - Ngoepe, Mpho

AB  - Innovative publishing models have emerged to meet the demands of the ‘publish or perish’ philosophy prevalent in academic and scholarly circles. Publishing models serve as the operational blueprint underpinning the value and supply chains of products in the publishing industry, aligning operational plans, design strategies, and production methodologies with the overarching goal of scholarly publishing. The duty of scholarly publishers to advance knowledge and disseminate it widely necessitates their role in supporting researchers to meet the expectations of the ‘publish or perish’ culture. This philosophy becomes even more critical in the endangered landscape of scholarly publishing in Africa, where scholarly publishing is evidently perishing, as researchers in the region face additional challenges in accessing reputable publishing outlets for their work. Zimbabwe has a low research publishing output, and although it ranks second in southern Africa, it lags behind South Africa by an astounding 65%. This intensifies the pressure to publish to maintain visibility and credibility within the global academic community. This paper thus examines the publishing models implemented in the publishing of scholarly works by scholarly publishers in Zimbabwe. Qualitative data were collected through the Delphi Technique design, with publishing experts over three rounds of interviews, and triangulated with data from document analysis. The key findings indicate open access, self-publishing, and collaborative publishing as effective market models for university presses. However, Zimbabwean universities are still lagging behind, as few have established university presses.

AB  - Stakeholders might have diverging or conflicting expectations about the functions that peer review should fulfil. We aimed to explore how stakeholder groups perceive peer review and what they expect from it. We conducted qualitative focus group workshops with early‐, mid‐, and senior career scholars, editors, and publishers. We recruited participants following a purposive maximum variation sampling approach. To identify purposes of peer review, we conducted a thematic analysis. Stakeholders expected peer review (1) to assess the contributions of a manuscript, (2) to conduct quality control, (3) to improve manuscripts, (4) to assess the suitability of manuscripts for a journal, (5) to provide a decision‐making tool for editors, (6) to provide feedback by peers, (7) to curate a community, and (8) to provide a seal of accreditation for published articles. Stakeholders with different roles and tasks in the peer review process differed in the value they attached to the functions of peer review. Early‐ and mid‐career researchers valued social and feedback functions of peer review, while senior career researchers and editors expected it to instead perform a technical assessment of manuscripts and serve as a decision‐making tool. Publishers expected peer review to assess the suitability of manuscripts for their journals and to provide a seal of accreditation. This revealed a potential tension between functions of peer review. Stakeholder expectations are shaped by how stakeholders perceive their own roles both in relation to the peer review process and within their scientific community.

AB  - The appeal of metric evaluation of research impact has attracted considerable interest in recent times. Although the public at large and administrative bodies are much interested in the idea, scientists and other researchers are much more cautious, insisting that metrics are but an auxiliary instrument to the qualitative peer-based judgement. The goal of this article is to propose availing of such a well positioned construct as domain taxonomy as a tool for directly assessing the scope and quality of research. We first show how taxonomies can be used to analyze the scope and perspectives of a set of research projects or papers. Then we proceed to define a research team or researcher's rank by those nodes in the hierarchy that have been created or significantly transformed by the results of the researcher. An experimental test of the approach in the data analysis domain is described. Although the concept of taxonomy seems rather simplistic to describe all the richness of a research domain, its changes and use can be made transparent and subject to open discussions.

AB  - The purpose of this Theme Section (TS) is to discuss various aspects of quality, and quality assurance, in science publishing.While we will each have our own views about exactly what this means, the editorial policy statement of the Council of Science Editors uses the following adjectives in reference to the quality of a scientific journal's content: accurate, valid, reliable, credible, authoritative, relevant to the journal's scope and mission, readable, and comprehensible.A standard dictionary definition of quality control is: '…a method of establishing and maintaining a high level of quality in a product or process through careful organizing, constant checking and painstaking corrections.'In this context, most of us would probably agree that the publisher, the editorial board, the reviewers and (not least) the authors are all involved in creating, defining, measuring and maintaining quality.Thus, we asked a cross-section of people with experience of one or more aspects of science publishing to present their views on the theme.The main points of consensus that emerge from the essays follow.Most contributors identified the importance of good scientific writing.When a manuscript has not been well written by the author(s), thorough and professionally astute editing is a necessity.This requires great care to preserve the exactness of the text despite possibly significant revisions, restructuring, and/or deletion of what is unsuitable, superfluous and/or badly written.This task is shared by the reviewers of the manuscript's scientific content, and by copy editors.The former focus on what is, or is not, essential to the scientific story being told, and the latter on the clarity of the prose and the correctness of the grammar and syntax.This process takes time, but it is worth waiting for if the result is something that will be more easily read.This is the essence of production quality.The fundamental importance of good scientific judgement in deciding a manuscript's fate was mentioned by all contributors.This crucial decision must be taken by a hands-on Editor who is an acknowledged authority in the subject area of any particular article, and who is a respected scientist capable and courageous enough to arbitrate openly and fairly when confronted with divergent views among authors and reviewers.The sheer number of manuscripts received by our discipline's most successful scholarly journals (over 700 per year at MEPS alone), and the wondrous breadth of their subject matter, makes this an extremely challenging task.The views expressed here suggest that the 'Subject Editors plus Editor-in-Chief' model is probably the best way of assuring scientific quality, as well as being more transparent and accountable than alternative models of editorial decision making.Authors themselves are best positioned to decide upon the most appropriate Subject Editor to handle the evaluation process.There should be a sufficient number of Subject Editors to cover the journal's scope: no more, lest they become idle and their title meaningless, and no less, to ensure that the workload is reasonably distributed and that they are only responsible for papers that fall within their own field of expertise.Subject Editors must be actively engaged in the review process, able to dissect the arguments of authors and reviewers alike and to provide guidance and leadership, and thus arrive at decisions that are transparent and well founded.Their decisions should still be open to appeal to an Editor-in-Chief, a person of recognised eminence and broad experience, and that decision would be final.The Editor-in-Chief, presumably in consultation with the rest of the Editorial Board, and the Publisher, would set a common Editorial policy and ensure that it is consistently applied.This system is not yet widely applied in marine science publishing, but it is the most common decision-making framework

AB  - An increasing portion of biomedical research relies on the use of biobanks and databases. Sharing of such resources is essential for optimizing knowledge production. A major obstacle for sharing bioresources is the lack of recognition for the efforts involved in establishing, maintaining and sharing them, due to, in particular, the absence of adequate tools. Increasing demands on biobanks and databases to improve access should be complemented with efforts of end-users to recognize and acknowledge these resources. An appropriate set of tools must be developed and implemented to measure this impact. To address this issue we propose to measure the use in research of such bioresources as a value of their impact, leading to create an indicator: Bioresource Research Impact Factor (BRIF). Key elements to be assessed are: defining obstacles to sharing samples and data, choosing adequate identifier for bioresources, identifying and weighing parameters to be considered in the metrics, analyzing the role of journal guidelines and policies for resource citing and referencing, assessing policies for resource access and sharing and their influence on bioresource use. This work allows us to propose a framework and foundations for the operational development of BRIF that still requires input from stakeholders within the biomedical community.

AB  - Nowadays, Open Access Mega-Journals (OAMJs) represent a substantial part of the scholarly communication system. The current research is conducted with the aim of providing better insights into the increasingly important OAMJ phenomenon through investigation of eight reputable titles using established bibliometric methods. Results of the study showed that eight studied OAMJs were responsible for 1.87% of the total number of publication indexed in Web of Science during 2012-2016. Despite the decline in publication count of PLOS ONE over the past couple of years, it was the biggest journal in the world till 2017, when Scientific Reports overtook PLOS ONE as the most productive journal. Over 88% of the papers published in eight selected OAMJs were cited at-least once at the point in time of analysis. The highest proportions of cited and un-cited documents were seen in Scientific Reports and SpringerPlus, respectively. With regard to the three indicators, namely share of highly-cited papers, the category normalized citation impact as well as the JIF percentile, IEEE Access had by far the best performance among eight examined OAMJs. Results of the study revealed that Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology, Multidisciplinary Sciences, Neurosciences, Oncology and Immunology were the most commonly assigned subject categories to OAMJs’ content. The National Natural Science Foundation of China was the most important funding agency that supported the publication of around 26000 articles in eight studied OAMJs. Investigation of the geographic distribution of authors showed that the United States and China by far had the highest contribution in the content of eight studied OAMJs. There were, however, notable variations between different OAMJs.

AB  - SUMMARY We question whether blacklists are the best answer to the serious problem of predatory journals. In conjunction with the worrying recent rise in the number of predatory journals, a remarkable number of blacklists have been compiled for specific scientific fields. However, predatory journals are continuously changing names and publishers; they are set up to make easy money and buried shortly after. Predatory journals have such a rapidly evolving nature that it is hard to keep track of them and keep blacklists up to date. We therefore propose a focus on ‘whitelists’ and directories of virtuous journals rather than on blacklists of pseudo-journals. We suggest that a set of criteria be determined that journals have to meet to be qualify as legitimate. In addition, the scientific community should come up with strategies to close the established biomedical databases to predatory journals, thus preventing them from achieving global exposure.

AB  - Predatory journals are a well-known issue for scholarly publishing and they are repositories for bogus research. In recent years, the number of predatory journals has risen and it is necessary to present a solution for this challenge. In this paper, we will discuss about a possible ranking of predatory journals. Our ranking approach is based on Beall's criteria for detection of predatory journals and it can help editors to improve their journals or convert their questionable journals to non-predatory ones. Moreover, our approach could help young editors to protect their journals against predatory practice. Finally, we present a case study to clarify our approach.

AB  - In 2013, Jeffrey Beall published an attack on the open-access scholarship movement in tripleC: “The Open-Access Movement Is Not Really About Open Access”. This article examines the claims and arguments of that contribution. Beall’s article makes broad generalizations about open-access advocates with very little supporting evidence, but his rhetoric provides good examples of what Albert O. Hirschman called the “rhetoric of reaction”. Specifically, it provides examples of the perversity thesis, the futility thesis, and the jeopardy thesis in action. While the main argument is both unsound and invalid, it does show a rare example of reactionary rhetoric from a librarian.

AB  - Abstract By analyzing 25,671 journals largely absent from common journal counts, as well as Web of Science and Scopus, this study demonstrates that scholarly communication is more of a global endeavor than is commonly credited. These journals, employing the open-source publishing platform Open Journal Systems (OJS), have published 5.8 million items; they are in 136 countries, with 79.9% in the Global South and 84.2% following the OA diamond model (charging neither reader nor author). A substantial proportion of journals operate in more than one language (48.3%), with research published in 60 languages (led by English, Indonesian, Spanish, and Portuguese). The journals are distributed across the social sciences (45.9%), STEM (40.3%), and the humanities (13.8%). For all their geographic, linguistic, and disciplinary diversity, 1.2% are indexed in the Web of Science and 5.7% in Scopus. On the other hand, 1.0% are found in Cabell’s Predatory Reports, and 1.4% show up in Beall’s (2021) questionable list. This paper seeks to both contribute to and historically situate the expanded scale and diversity of scholarly publishing in the hope that this recognition may assist humankind in taking full advantage of what is increasingly a global research enterprise.

AB  - Abstract After the closure of Jeffrey Beall’s open access “predatory” publishing blacklists in mid-January of 2017, a new “predatory publishing” blacklist emerged in 2018, Dolos list. This blacklist, curated by “Professor Alexandre Georges”, became defunct sometime in late 2020 or early 2021 based on publicly available clues. In this paper, several aspects of this blacklist, as retrieved from the Internet Archive and ResearchGate, were examined, including the profile of “Alexandre Georges”. The veracity of this individual’s identity is questioned. Discussion is provided about the citation, use and promotion of Dolos list in the literature and on websites as a solution and/or resource pertaining to “predatory” publishing. Given the questionable nature of the now-defunct Dolos blacklist website, and the uncertainty regarding the veracity of its curator’s identity, the author holds the opinion that sites that continue to promote the Dolos list may also be spreading inaccurate information (i.e., misinformation) to academics.

AB  - Background Optimizing access to high-quality scientific journals has become an important priority for academic departments, including the ability to read the scientific literature and the ability to afford to publish papers in those journals. In this contribution, we assess the question of whether institutional investment in scientific journals aligns with the journals where researchers send their papers for publication, and where they serve as unpaid reviewers and editors. Methods We assembled a unique suite of information about the publishing habits of our Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, including summaries of 3,540 journal publications by 35 faculty members. These data include economic costs of journals to institutions and to authors, benefits to authors in terms of journal prestige and citation rates, and considerations of ease of reading access for individuals both inside and outside the university. This dataset included data on institutional costs, including subscription pricing (rarely visible to scholars), and “investment” by scholars in supporting journals, such as time spent as editors and reviewers. Results Our results highlighted the complex set of relationships between these factors, and showed that institutional costs often do not match well with payoffs in terms of benefits to researchers ( e.g. , citation rate, prestige of journal, ease of access). Overall, we advocate for greater cost-benefit transparency to help compare different journals and different journal business models; such transparency would help both researchers and their institutions in investing wisely the limited resources available to academics.

AB  - Although a case can be made for rewarding scientists for risky, novel science rather than for incremental, reliable science, novelty without reliability ceases to be science. The currently available evidence suggests that the most prestigious journals are no better at detecting unreliable science than other journals. In fact, some of the most convincing studies show a negative correlation, with the most prestigious journals publishing the least reliable science. With the credibility of science increasingly under siege, how much longer can we afford to reward novelty at the expense of reliability? Here, I argue for replacing the legacy journals with a modern information infrastructure that is governed by scholars. This infrastructure would allow renewed focus on scientific reliability, with improved sort, filter, and discovery functionalities, at massive cost savings. If these savings were invested in additional infrastructure for research data and scientific code and/or software, scientific reliability would receive additional support, and funding woes—for, e.g., biological databases—would be a concern of the past.

AB  - The scholarly community’s current definition of “open” captures only some of the attributes of openness that exist across different publishing models and content types. Open is not an end in itself, but a means for achieving the most effective dissemination of scholarship and research. We suggest that the different attributes of open exist along a broad spectrum and propose an alternative way of describing and evaluating openness based on four attributes: discoverable, accessible, reusable, and transparent. These four attributes of openness, taken together, form the draft “DART Framework for Open Access.” This framework can be applied to both research artifacts as well as research processes. We welcome input from the broader scholarly community about this framework.OSI2016 workgroup questionThere is a broad difference of opinion among the many stakeholders in scholarly publishing about how to precisely define open access publishing. Are “open access” and “open data” what we mean by open? Does “open” mean anything else? Does it mean “to make available,” or “to make freely available in a particular format?” Is a clearer definition needed (or maybe just better education on the current definition)? Why or why not? At present, some stakeholders see public access as being an acceptable stopping point in the move toward open access. Others see “open” as requiring free and immediate access with articles being available in CC-BY format. The range of opinions between these extremes is vast. How should these differences be decided? Who should decide? Is it possible to make binding recommendations (and how)? Is consensus necessary? What are the consequences of the lack of consensus?

AB  - Abstract In order to be able to provide thorough and timely coverage on the most recent scientific research, science journalists frequently rely on embargoed information sent to them by publishers of scientific journals. In such embargo e-mails, publishers purposefully bring selected upcoming releases to the journalists’ attention a few days in advance of their publication. Little is known on how this early highlighting of certain research articles affects their later citations or altmetrics. We present an exploratory case study with the aim of assessing the effects of such promotion activities on scientific articles’ bibliometric and altmetric indicators. In a treatment–control design, we analyze citation counts and eight types of altmetrics of 715 articles published between 2016 and 2017 whose DOIs have been mentioned in embargo e-mails and compare these to articles from the same journal issues that have not been highlighted in embargo e-mails. Descriptive statistics and Mann–Whitney-U tests reveal significant advantages for promoted articles across all regarded metrics three to four years after their publication. Particularly large differences can be seen regarding numbers of mentions in mainstream media, in blogs, on Twitter, and on Facebook. Our findings suggest that scholarly publishers exert significant influence over which research articles will receive attention and visibility in various (social) media. Also, regarding utilizations of metrics for evaluative purposes, the observed effects of promotional activities on indicators might constitute a factor of undesirable influence that currently does not receive the amount of consideration in scientometric assessments that it should receive.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to give a macro-picture of collaboration in research groups and networks across all academic fields in Norwegian research universities, and to examine the relative importance of membership in groups and networks for individual publication output. To our knowledge, this is a new approach, which may provide valuable information on collaborative patterns in a particular national system, but of clear relevance to other national university systems. At the system level, conducting research in groups and networks are equally important, but there are large differences between academic fields. The research group is clearly most important in the field of medicine and health, while undertaking research in an international network is most important in the natural sciences. Membership in a research group and active participation in international networks are likely to enhance publication productivity and the quality of research.

AB  - This article analyzes researchers’ adoption of an institutional central fund (or faculty publication fund) for open-access (OA) article-processing charges (APCs) to contribute to a wider understanding of take-up of OA journal publishing (“Gold” OA). Quantitative data, recording central fund usage at the University of Nottingham from 2006 to 2014, are analyzed alongside qualitative data from institutional documentation. The importance of the settings of U.K. national policy developments and international OA adoption trends are considered. Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) is used as an explanatory framework. It is shown that use of the central fund grew during the period from covering less than 1% of the University’s outputs to more than 12%. Health and Life Sciences disciplines made greatest use of the fund. Although highly variable, average APC prices rose during the period, with fully OA publishers setting lower average APCs. APCs were paid largely from internal funds, but external funding became increasingly important. Key factors in adoption are identified to be increasing awareness and changing perceptions of OA, communication, disciplinary differences, and adoption mandates. The study provides a detailed longitudinal analysis of one of the earliest central funds to be established globally with a theoretically informed explanatory model to inform future work on managing central funds and developing institutional and national OA policies.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to report on the findings of the second phase of the Behavioural strand of the EC‐funded PEER project ( http://www.peerproject.eu/ ). The paper seeks to explore authors' and readers' behaviours in relation to authors' peer‐reviewed accepted manuscripts in open access repositories. Design/methodology/approach The research was undertaken using a mixed‐method approach, involving the distribution of a survey by the 12 participating publishers to their authors in selected journal titles and a participatory workshop with European researchers from selected disciplinary areas. Findings Researchers' attitudes towards versions of published journal articles made open access via open access repositories may vary depending on whether researchers report behaviours from the perspective of an author or a reader. The research found that disciplinary cultures, norms and traditions shape authors' self‐archiving behaviour and readers' use of those versions of journal articles held in repositories. Research limitations/implications One of the limitations of the research is that it was impossible for the research team to gauge the representativeness of the survey compared to the actual disciplinary distribution of the population of EU researchers, as such population information is not available in an aggregated and consistent format. Originality/value The PEER Observatory is an unprecedented large‐scale collaboration between publishers, researchers and repositories to investigate the effects of self‐archiving at European level. The paper provides a disciplinary reading of the findings and augments the understanding of how disciplinary culture and norms shape authors' and readers' behaviours in relation to self‐archiving.

AB  - Objective – This study investigated researchers’ perceptions of open access publishing and the ways in which the university’s open access subvention fund could evolve to meet the campus community’s needs. Methods – In spring 2021, two librarians conducted an anonymous survey using a convenience sample to recruit participants. The survey was directly distributed to 113 University of Idaho (U of I) affiliates who had received funding from, or expressed interest in, the open access subvention fund during the previous three years (FY 2019 to FY 2021). Other U of I affiliates were also offered the opportunity to participate in the survey via a link shared in the U of I’s daily email newsletter as well across the U of I’s graduate student email list. The researchers received 42 usable survey responses. The survey included 26 closed and open-ended questions and analysis included cross-tabulations based on fund applicant status as well as respondent role. Of the 26 questions, 4 were modified from a colleague’s previous study with U of I faculty members (Gaines, 2015). Results – Survey responses showed that interest in and support for open access were common among respondents. Although a majority of respondents had published an open access journal article and would like to continue to publish open access in the future, only 17% agreed that they had departmental support to do so. Results also demonstrated that researchers were less willing to pay article processing charges (APCs) out-of-pocket and preferred for funding to come from grant budgets first, followed by Office of Research Budgets, department or college budgets, and library budgets. Respondents expressed support for many of the open access subvention fund’s current criteria and processes, but they also indicated an interest in establishing a more equitable fund distribution cycle and allowing researchers to seek pre-approval once their article was accepted for peer-review. Findings related to open access publishing perspectives built upon previous research conducted at the U of I (Gaines, 2015) and across other institutions. Conclusion – This study confirmed the importance of evaluating and assessing library programs and services to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of campus communities. Through the study results, the researchers demonstrated that respondents were interested in open access publishing and the continuation of the open access subvention fund, as well as offering the U of I an opportunity to adjust the open access subvention fund’s processes to better serve researchers. These results also highlighted the need for those involved in open access publishing support to investigate new open access advocacy and education efforts to ensure that researchers receive the philosophical and financial support they need to pursue different models of scholarly publishing.

AB  - This research explored the awareness, usage and perspectives of Tanzanian researchers on open access as a mode of scholarly communication. A survey questionnaire targeted 544 respondents selected through stratified random sampling from a population of 1088 university researchers of the six public universities in Tanzania. With a response rate of 73%, the data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. The study reveals that the majority of the researchers were aware of and were positive towards open access. Findings further indicate that the majority of researchers in Tanzanian public universities used open access outlets more to access scholarly content than to disseminate their own research findings. It seems that most of these researchers would support open access publishing more if issues of recognition, quality and ownership were resolved. Thus many of them supported the idea of establishing institutional repositories at their respective universities as a way of improving the dissemination of local content. The study recommends that public universities and other research institutions in the country should consider establishing institutional repositories, with appropriate quality assurance measures, to improve the dissemination of research output emanating from these institutions.

AB  - Abstract The Academy of Finland (AKA), Finland’s major public research funding agency, uses a Web of Science (WoS) based bibliometric indicator to assess the performance of research it has funded. We use an alternative methodology to compare (1) the research performance and (2) the scholarly communication profile of AKA-funded research to the Finnish universities’ entire output across the major fields of arts and sciences. Our data consists of 142,742 publications (years 2015–2018) registered in the national information service, which integrates Current Research Information System (CRIS) data of 13 Finnish universities. Research performance is analyzed using the Finnish community-curated expert-based rating of publication channels (so-called JUFO). Our results show that compared to the Finnish universities’ entire output a larger share of AKA-funded research is published in leading JUFO rated journals and book publishers. JUFO and WoS-based indicators produced consonant results regarding the performance of AKA-funded research. Analysis of publication profiles shows that AKA-funded research is more focused than the universities’ output on using peer-reviewed publications, articles published in journals, English language, foreign publishers and open access publishing. We conclude that the CRIS-based publication data can support multidimensional assessments of research performance and scholarly communication profiles, potentially also in other countries and institutions. CRIS development and maintenance require multi-stakeholder commitment, resources and incentives to ensure data quality and coverage. To fully recognize diverse open science practices and to enable international comparisons, CRISs need further development and integration as data sources.

AB  - Scholarly communication plays a significant role in the development and dissemination of research outputs in library and information science (LIS).This study presents findings from a survey which examines the key attributes that characterize the publishing by Pakistani LIS scholars, i.e. academics and professionals, in national journals.A pilot-tested, electronic questionnaire was used to collect the data from the target population.104 respondents (or 69.3% of target) provided feedback on areas such as number of articles published, number of citations, and the nature of any collaboration with other authors.The findings of this survey revealed that, among the various designated regions of Pakistan, the Punjab region was the most highly represented.In articles published in national journals, there was a clear preference among all respondents to collaborate with at least one other author.The citation metrics for LIS articles in national journals were relatively low (30.22%), which aligns with Scimago's Journal and Country Rankings.The uptake of social scholarly networks mirrors international trends.Respondents were asked to score factors which could impact negatively on their ability to undertake research and/or publish the results.The study recommends that concerned stakeholders work together, as appropriate, to address concerns.In addition, it recommends that further research be undertaken to define patterns of Pakistani co-authorship in the social sciences.

AB  - This article investigates the potential role for research students in an institutional repository (IR). Face-to-face interviews with 34 research students at Loughborough University were carried out. Using a mixture of closed and open questions, the interviews explored the students’ experiences and opinions of publishing, open access and the proposed Loughborough repository. As both authors and readers, students were most interested in access to complete theses, postprints and conference papers. The ability to disseminate their work and to receive feedback and commentary were the most important motivators to students depositing work in the IR, closely followed by the principle of open access. The greatest deterrents were the risk of being unable to publish elsewhere later, the ownership of copyright and plagiarism. Appropriate recommendations are made for the implementation of an institutional repository.

AB  - Predatory publishing represents a major challenge to scholarly communication. This paper maps the infiltration of journals suspected of predatory practices into the citation database Scopus and examines cross-country differences in the propensity of scholars to publish in such journals. Using the names of "potential, possible, or probable" predatory journals and publishers on Beall's lists, we derived the ISSNs of 3,293 journals from Ulrichsweb and searched Scopus with them. 324 of journals that appear both in Beall's lists and Scopus with 164 thousand articles published over 2015-2017 were identified. Analysis of data for 172 countries in 4 fields of research indicates that there is a remarkable heterogeneity. In the most affected countries, including Kazakhstan and Indonesia, around 17% of articles fall into the predatory category, while some other countries have no predatory articles whatsoever. Countries with large research sectors at the medium level of economic development, especially in Asia and North Africa, tend to be most susceptible to predatory publishing. Arab, oil-rich and/or eastern countries also appear to be particularly vulnerable. Policymakers and stakeholders in these and other developing countries need to pay more attention to the quality of research evaluation.The online version contains supplementary material available at (10.1007/s11192-020-03852-4).

ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack CitationsPermissions ShareFacebookTwitterLinked InMendeleyWechatReddit Figures & Info The driving force behind most scientists' careers is to achieve the maximum visibility for their research. Since the creation of the first scientific journals in the mid-seventeenth century, scientists have condensed their data and conclusions into a manuscript and happily handed this over to a publisher, who in return has printed it and distributed it to those willing—or whose institutes are willing—to pay a subscription fee. But the triple whammy of rising journal prices, an exploding number of journals and imploding library budgets means that the bulk of this work can now only be accessed by a small fraction of its intended audience. The arrival of the World Wide Web has the potential to change this reality: now that the vast majority of printed articles are also available in an electronic form, which is theoretically accessible by anyone with an interest and an internet connection, shouldn't all articles become free for everyone to read? …publishing is still operating largely on an economic model that evolved when there were fewer journals, available only in print This reasoning has spawned the ‘open-access’ model of publishing, which has been proclaimed as a revolution in science and was the main focus of an EMBL/EMBO-organized meeting entitled ‘Science Publishing at the Crossroads’, held on 7 June 2003 at the Print Media Academy in Heidelberg, Germany. Technological advances now enable wider access to scientific literature with no associated distribution costs, but publishing is still operating largely on an economic model that evolved when there were fewer journals, available only in print. Jean-Claude Guédon, a science historian from the University of Montreal, Canada, concluded his overview of science publishing by saying, “The beauty of science is that it has been the first operational example of how humanity can create a system of distributed intelligence. Right now it's not working in the best possible way with regard to communication. We haven't scaled up so well.” Around 28,000 scientific periodicals exist at present, and the market for these is incredibly inelastic; most journals and the articles published in them are monopolies, and there is no market correction of prices as a result of competition. If you need an article published in journal X, a subscription to journal Y is of no use. In the 1960s, commercial publishers realized the potential profit to be made in disseminating information, and through their launch of new journals and their control of the core, traditional titles, they have since held a firm grip on scientific communication and the evaluation of scientists. Journal prices have risen dramatically—an institutional subscription to a bundle of seven titles including Brain Research, for example, is US $20,000 a year—and publishers are being accused of reaping extortionate profits. Guédon asked, “Is this optimal? Is this the best way to do things for the scientific community?” His answer: no. “Only the wealthiest institutions from the wealthiest countries can afford these things. Brains are being wasted.” In response to this, a number of new initiatives aim to provide everyone in the scientific community and interested members of the public with access to what are, after all, the results of publicly funded research. These include the commercial venture BioMedCentral, which at present publishes 90 open-access journals, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), the Joint Information Systems Committee and the Open Society Institute, whose meeting in December 2001 gave rise to the Budapest Open Access Initiative that brought the open-access movement to the forefront. One of the most high-profile organizations, however, is the not-for-profit Public Library of Science (PLoS), co-founded by Harold Varmus, then director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), Pat Brown from the Stanford University of Medicine (CA, USA) and Michael Eisen from the University of California at Berkeley, USA. At the meeting Eisen explained, “It's easy to envisage a day when there will be ‘Public Libraries of Science’ where anybody can go and browse the scientific literature. What we're trying to address is why this obvious common good has not become a reality.” “We are not just another Nature, Science or Cell. We are morally superior and what we are doing is better for the future of science.” The current generation of scientists is much more familiar with PubMed and Google than the contents of their library shelves, so it is common for them to stumble across abstracts of articles relevant to their research in journals that would otherwise be outside their core reading. And if their library does not have a subscription to this journal, this not only causes frustration but also inhibits research. The life sciences are now extremely data-driven and a great deal of information needs to be integrated from studies at many different levels: molecular, cellular, organismal and environmental. For progress to be made, this information needs to be freely accessible. Eisen compared the current restrictions on the literature with that of DNA databases such as GenBank. “It is insane that the data itself is made available but the methods that I used and the conclusions that I drew from it are not.” Furthermore, he feels that the greatest opportunity that is being wasted is that of enabling scientists to find new and creative ways to use and integrate the literature, which we cannot yet envisage. Eisen said, “We are not just another Nature, Science or Cell. We are morally superior and what we are doing is better for the future of science.” In this current backlash against what are portrayed as greedy, money-grabbing commercial publishers, Elsevier is bearing the brunt of the mudslinging—with more than 1,700 titles and pre-tax profits for 2002 of around €1.5 billion, they are an obvious target. Varmus recently gave an interview to the German newspaper Die Zeit, and at the mention of Elsevier exclaimed, “That's the devil!” However, at the meeting, Elsevier's then chief executive, Derk Haank, strongly defended his company's position and outlined the benefits that will come from their transition to electronic publishing. Elsevier have so far digitized 4.4 million scientific articles and aim to have all 8 million articles on the web by the end of next year for all their subscribers to access. “Our end goal is that we want the whole world to have access to our material 24 hours a day with no additional charges to the end user. That is also open access, but it's paid for by the librarian.” Haank also outlined their differential pricing scheme, which should make this information accessible to most institutions—those in developing countries have free access, those in intermediate countries and small institutions in the developed world are charged a reduced fee, and only the wealthy, large institutions pay the full subscription. “The important thing to remember is that even in electronic publishing, the costs don't go away. Somebody has to pay,” he said. Indeed, the costs of publishing can be significant. A professional editorial office to oversee the reviewing process, editing, and conversion of material to an electronic format are arguably dispensable, but do add to the quality and readability of the final article. Furthermore, Haank noted, “In our experience with electronic publishing, the costs don't go down, they go up. We have to invest in search machines, databases and archiving.” Unrestricted access to the literature appears to be a common end-goal, but given the inescapable costs and the proposed lack of subscription revenue, the question is: who pays? In the open-access model, journals will recoup costs by charging for the service they provide to authors, rather than for content. The original tactic of the PLoS was to convert existing publishers to an open-access model by calling for a boycott of those that operated under a closed-access policy, but this had little effect. “We've spent far too long hammering on the publishers' doors and telling them that they need to change, but the publishers will only change when we make them change,” said Eisen. It was this realization that prompted PLoS to launch two new journals, PLoS Biology and PLoS Medicine, in December 2002, with a US $9 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The journals' contents will be freely available on the web and the first edition of PLoS Biology is planned for October 2003. Their business model is to charge authors to publish—US $1,500 per paper is the current estimate—or to charge institutions a subscription fee, which allows any of their researchers to subsequently publish free of charge. The NIH, Cancer Research UK and all the UK's universities are among the 250 institutions that have signed up so far. “The important thing to remember is that even in electronic publishing, the costs don't go away. Somebody has to pay” The original ‘author pays’ concept is already being refined to a ‘system pays’ model, which works on the principle that the money for subscriptions comes from scientists' grants when their institution takes its percentage to fund its library. This money simply needs to be rechannelled, Eisen said. “The question isn't really who pays, it is how we pay. We should view the costs of publication as fundamental costs of doing the research in the first place. They are the last small but critical piece of money we spend as part of the research process. What could be more fundamental than communicating your results to the rest of the community and the public?” In response to this, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute has allocated part of their grants specifically for publication fees, and other funding bodies, such as the NIH, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust, have endorsed this model. Eisen commented “We have given the scientific community this opportunity and now the real question is will the scientific community respond in the way that it should?” But even though these competing open-access journals have been created, the scientists' shift to publishing in them is likely to be slow, most crucially because of the career structures that are in place at present. As long as scientists rely on publishing in high-impact journals to secure funding, there is no incentive to switch to new, open-access models. There needs, therefore, to be changes in the way grant-awarding bodies assess performance and in the attitudes of scientists who reinforce the system by aiming to publish only in prestigious journals. In the meantime, however, Frank Gannon, executive director of the EMBO and a senior group leader at the EMBL, warned that “PhD students have their career to make and should not be sacrificed on some altar of idealism.” Furthermore, moving from a subscription-based model may not necessarily suit all journals. There is a high demand for secondary information in the form of reviews and analyses that distill primary data into time-efficient summaries, but journals that feature such articles are particularly labour-intensive and would find it difficult to recoup their costs under the proposed system. Indeed, the only way that journals may be able to protect their subscriptions is by providing content that readers are willing to purchase, possibly in the form of on-line ‘knowledge environments’ on specific topics of research. Society journals may also find it difficult to move to an open-access model because they rely on the profit from subscriptions to fund other activities. Once the costs of publishing become more transparent, societies will need to find other ways of fundraising to support, for example, their fellowship schemes and conferences. Conversely, open access is more in line with the mission of societies, in that it maximizes the visibility of research in their field. Sally Morris, secretary general of the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers, said: “There is a lot of interest in the model […] Society journals are realising that maybe it would be better for their communities.” Some journals, including those published by the Company of Biologists and the Society of Endocrinology, are seriously considering moving to the hybrid economic model proposed by David Prosser from SPARC. In what will be an interesting experiment, articles will be available only to subscribers unless the author chooses to pay, in which case they will be freely available on the web. This should demonstrate in the short term whether there is a willingness to pay, and in the longer term whether open access does indeed create increased visibility, and thus citations. “This way there's no risk [for the journals],” said Morris. …even though these competing open-access journals have been created, the scientists' shift to publishing in them is likely to be slow, most crucially because of the career structures that are in place at present Many journals will await the outcome of these trials before committing themselves to open access, particularly given that there are still many question marks over the economics of the model. The true costs will not be apparent for some time as PLoS is at present subsidized by grants, so their eventual author charge is not certain. Also, should journals with high rejection rates pass on all their editorial costs to the authors of accepted papers, or also charge an initial submission fee? The latter is likely to be strongly resisted, as authors already invest significant amounts of time and emotion in each submission without also paying for the experience. If space is unrestricted and economics rule, what is the disincentive for the lower-impact journals to increase their returns by lowering the rejection rate? The result could be an increase in the quantity of scientific articles at the expense of quality. Guédon also speculated that a new market could develop, such that journals are not only competing on impact factors, but also on price. “Will you pay $1,500 to PLoS or will you pay $7,000 to another publisher given that the money will buy you this branding or that branding? At that point, the battle really starts.” And if the institutions that suffer the most under the current subscription model are the poorer ones, nothing will change for them under the open-access model. PLoS will waive the fee for researchers from developing countries, but those from institutions that do not quite qualify may be excluded from publishing for financial reasons. Gannon said, “We'll be back with another moral dilemma. We have to make countries recognize that it is a tremendously positive investment for them to make the money available such that articles can be published freely.” …an overhaul of the system is perhaps a more complex task than it first appeared when PLoS emerged with their battle cries of revolution The concept of open-access publishing and the clear benefits that it holds for science are not in debate, but an overhaul of the system is perhaps a more complex task than it first appeared when PLoS emerged with their battle cries of revolution. Many parties have a role to play in the transition, including publishers, funding bodies, societies and of course scientists. At the same time, changes are taking place in the publishing world to improve accessibility without a full-scale break with the systems that are already in place. Journals are being made free to those in the developing world, and many journals are making their content free on the web after a delay of 6–12 months. For some journals, authors now retain the copyright of their work and grant the publishers a ‘license to publish’. Differential pricing, as highlighted by Haank, is also important for disseminating information in a more fair and democratic manner. Even if the revolution does not materialize, it will no doubt speed up the evolution of the current pay-per-access model; it is therefore worth taking the time now to work out a system that is optimal. “These new initiatives do have an impact on established parties. I hope that we will indeed move towards [open access] through evolution,” Haank concluded. “The only thing that I object to is people destroying what is good about the old system for the sake of destroying it. Let's all move [forward] together.” Previous ArticleNext Article Volume 4Issue 81 August 2003In this issue RelatedDetailsLoading ...

TI  - Rise of the predators: Business is booming in the murky global market of suspect and sham publishers and journals
IS  - 4
VL  - 124
AU  - Nelson, Bryn
AB  - This is Part 1 of a 3-part series on the origins, impacts, and opponents of predatory journals. One Russian-owned journal that may or may not be based in Warsaw, Poland, appears to have a fake editorial board and a bogus impact factor. Another publisher and prolifi c spammer with a posted address in Wilmington, Delaware, but a more likely base in Hyderabad, India, has closely copied the scope and aims of legitimate medical journals published by Amsterdam-based Elsevier. A third publishing company based in Delhi, India, recently launched with 61 journal titles. The only journal with articles published as of mid-February falsely claimed to be a member of the respected Committee on Publication Ethics and included 4 articles and a review, all coauthored by its editor-in-chief. The Scholarly Open Access blog, fueled by tips from readers around the world, reads like a curio cabinet of questionable publication practices. As recounted by blogger Jeffrey Beall, associate professor and scholarly communications librarian at the University of Colorado in Denver, some e-mail requests to submit manuscripts have the awkward wording of a document run through Google Translate. Others suggest a more sophisticated attempt to deceive, and a few publishers and journals have even copied the names and logos of reputable counterparts to fool unwary researchers. Beyond his blog, Mr. Beall compiles lengthy annual lists of shady publishers and stand-alone journals. In a broad sense, he says, they all share 3 traits: they lack transparency, use deception, and do not adhere to industry standards for scholarly publishing. More specifi - cally, “Beall's List of Predatory Open- Access Publishers” is based on roughly 2 dozen criteria (with another 2 dozen practices refl ecting poor journal standards). Among them, Mr. Beall cites the absence of an editorial or review board, the excessive use of spam e-mails to solicit manuscripts, insufficient or hidden information regarding author fees, and false impact factors to feign international standing. Why the subterfuge? “It's all about money,” he says. And business, by most accounts, is booming. Based on Mr. Beall's criteria, Finnish researchers Cenyu Shen and Bo-Christer Björk recently estimated that predatory journals poured more than 420,000 articles into the scientifi c market in 2014, compared with only 53,000 in 2010.1 Mr. Beall's efforts have put him on a fi rst-name basis with a university lawyer due to the legal threats he receives, and a detractor in Serbia once sent him a menacing picture of a knife. Other critics have raised more measured concerns with his methods, his outspoken skepticism of open-source publications, and the feasibility of his blacklists. However, interviews with researchers, editors, and transparency advocates in multiple countries have suggested that more awareness is desperately needed to counter a mushrooming trend in unethical publishing that is only likely to get worse. At an October 2015 meeting of the World Association of Medical Editors in New Delhi, India, Jocalyn Clark, PhD, gave a talk describing predatory journals and their potential impact on authors, institutions, and the scientifi c culture. Attendees were so concerned that they repeatedly raised the issue thereafter, says Dr. Clark, who was then the executive editor at icddr,b, a global health research organization in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and was recently named executive editor of The Lancet. “It felt like it was almost like a cry for help,” she recalls. A symposium on aligning publishing incentives with research transparency and integrity, held during the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference in Washington, DC, in February 2016, offered a far different view of predatory publishing. In response to a question about how to combat the problem, Science editorin- chief Marcia McNutt, PhD, expressed surprise that anyone would confuse a predatory journal with a legitimate one. “I'm not sure where the rocket science is here,” she said. However, as sham and suspect journals continue their upward trajectory, Dr. Clark, Ms. Shen, Mr. Beall, and other observers say many vulnerable researchers in developing countries lack suffi cient resources to distinguish real from predatory. Rather than a mere nuisance, Dr. Clark says, the rapidly growing “Wild West” of deceptive journals is threatening to become a full-blown crisis. According to Ms. Shen and Mr. Björk's analysis, India alone accounts for 27% of predatory publishers, with another 12% located in the rest of Asia, 18% in North America, and 9% in Europe. Researchers could not determine the location of more than a quarter of these publishers. The distribution of corresponding authors was more highly concentrated: approximately 35% were from India, 26% from the rest of Asia, and 16% from Africa, together accounting for more than 3 in 4 journal authors. Ms. Shen, a doctoral student at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki, Finland, says she believes the geographic concentration of authors partially refl ects how researchers are evaluated for their academic positions. In some countries, “international” publishing is required or highly rewarded, but without consideration of the journal's quality. “At the same time, academics from those countries have problems getting their articles accepted in traditional journals from big Anglo-American-Dutch-German publishers,”she says. Dr. Clark puts more of the onus on a research culture that has exported an intense publish-or-perish mindset to India, Bangladesh, and other emerging countries and created a huge new pool of scientists desperate to be authors. “But we're not necessarily providing the level of training and mentorship and support that a lot of scientists get in more developed settings,” she says. The result is fertile ground for exploitation. In 2015, David Moher, PhD, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Ontario, Canada, analyzed the 311 e-mail solicitations he received over a single year. Nearly 80% were from journals on Mr. Beall's list.2 The remainder shared many of the same traits, he writes, but the journals were likely too small or too new to be discovered. Dr. Clark conducted her own weeklong trial and counted twice as many predatory journal spam e-mails sent to her Bangladesh account as were sent to her account at the University of Toronto, where she is an adjunct assistant professor of medicine. The 2:1 ratio is no aberration, she says. Another recent study suggests that most authors published in predatory journals are young, inexperienced, and from developing countries.3 As part of their sales pitch, Mr. Beall says, predatory publishers are essentially hijacking the gold open-access business model, in which a journal fi nances all or part of its publishing costs by assessing article processing charges upon acceptance of authors' manuscripts (Cancer Cytopathology, which is published by Wiley on behalf of the American Cancer Society, uses a hybrid OnlineOpen model in which authors can choose to make their articles open access for a fee). In abusing the model, Mr. Beall says, predatory publishers often promise rapid publication and conduct little or no peer review after collecting the fees. Mr. Beall has attracted controversy himself through his criticism of the openaccess movement and what he views as weaknesses contributing to the exploitation of vulnerable researchers. Dr. Clark, a former senior editor at open-access journal PLOS Medicine, cautions that Mr. Beall's bias and lack of independent review could lead to the erroneous tarring of legitimate journals as predatory. Mr. Beall responds that few other transparency advocates have volunteered to help monitor suspicious publications (although the Directory of Open Access Journals maintains its own “white list” of high-quality journals). “I get e-mails almost every day from people who have been victimized by one or another publisher,” he says. If some naive researchers are being hoodwinked (and based on blog accounts, more than a few researchers in the United States and Europe are among them), others are knowingly using the shortcut to gain an “imprimatur of science,” as one South African researcher told Mr. Beall. At a recent conference on academic misconduct, University of California at Davis law professor Mario Biagioli suggested that rather than preying on authors, predatory journals may be co-conspirators peddling “counterfeit goods.” Either way, the shadowy entrepreneurs face a low startup barrier: after creating a Web site, they can use a template to create a fleet of journals with unique titles and send out spam solicitations to scientists. “It's a really easy and fast way to make a lot of money with almost no investment, and everybody's copying it right now,” Mr. Beall says. Despite their differences, he and Dr. Clark agree that it is a fl ourishing business model the global scientifi c community can no longer afford to ignore.

AB  - This is the first of a series of studies emanating from the UK JISC‐funded RoMEO Project (Rights Metadata for Open‐archiving) which investigated the IPR issues relating to academic author self‐archiving of research papers. It considers the claims for copyright ownership in research papers by universities, academics, and publishers by drawing on the literature, a survey of 542 academic authors and an analysis of 80 journal publisher copyright transfer agreements. The paper concludes that self‐archiving is not best supported by copyright transfer to publishers. It recommends that universities assert their interest in copyright ownership in the long term, that academics retain rights in the short term, and that publishers consider new ways of protecting the value they add through journal publishing.

AB  - In early 2016 a new database was launched on the Web of Science platform—Russian Science Citation Index. The database is free to all Web of Science subscribers except those from the post-Soviet states. This database includes papers from 652 selected Russian journals and is based on the data from national citation index—Russian Index of Science Citation (RISC). RISC was launched in 2005 but it is scarcely known to the English-language audience. The paper describes the history, current structure and user possibilities of RISC. We focus on the novel features of RISC which are crucial to bibliometrics and are unavailable in the international citation indexes.

AB  - This perspective highlights the potential of enhancing data systems to improve our understanding of the world and scale up the production of knowledge. It shows that despite an increase in data from various publications over time, we still experience limitations in scaling our systems. Shifts toward a more person-centric view of the world and enhanced open access to data can help address this challenge. The democratization of data is key in providing high-quality data about authors, their interests, and their work's impact, aiding relationships with authors and libraries and easing the burden of scaling. However, this requires collaboration and investment across the ecosystem.

AB  - This article reports on scholarly communication and open access ( OA ) in Korea. Drawing on a range of databases, articles, and reference sources, it provides unique insights. In contrast to the UK / US model of scholarly communication, in Korea, most scholarly journals are published by discipline‐based scholarly societies and research institutes affiliated to universities. Payment for publication is the norm, and typically features article processing charges and scholarly society membership fees for both OA and toll access ( TA ) journals. Online access to journals in Korea is provided by commercial vendors who enter into contracts with the scholarly societies for exclusive use. Three online access models apply – TA , gold OA , and dual access – with the use of these models varying between disciplines. In parallel with this access provided by commercial vendors, there are a number of government‐funded open access repositories (OARs) to which university researchers are requested to deposit their research outputs, as well as OARs run by universities and other research institutes.

These opportunities have also destabilized norms about the character of legitimate scholarly publishing in some fields. Unfortunately, much of the literature about scholarly e-publishing homogenizes the character of publishing. This article provides an analytical approach for evaluating disciplinary conventions and for proposing policies about scholarly e-publishing. We characterize three dimensions of scholarly publishing as a communicative practice—publicity, access, and trustworthiness—and examine several forms of paper and electronic publications in this framework. This analysis shows how the common claim that e-publishing "substantially expands access" is oversimplified. It also indicates how peer reviewing (whether in paper or electronically) provides valuable functions for scholarly communication that are not effectively replaced by self-posting articles in electronic media.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines issues relating to the perceptions and adoption of open access (OA) and institutional repositories. Using a survey research design, we collected data from academics and other researchers in the humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS) at a university in Australia. We looked at factors influencing choice of publishers and journal outlets, as well as the use of social media and nontraditional channels for scholarly communication. We used an online questionnaire to collect data and used descriptive statistics to analyse the data. Our findings suggest that researchers are highly influenced by traditional measures of quality, such as journal impact factor, and are less concerned with making their work more findable and promoting it through social media. This highlights a disconnect between researchers’ desired outcomes and the efforts that they put in toward the same. Our findings also suggest that institutional policies have the potential to increase OA awareness and adoption. This study contributes to the growing literature on scholarly communication by offering evidence from the HASS field, where limited studies have been conducted. Based on the findings, we recommend that academic librarians engage with faculty through outreach and workshops to change perceptions of OA and the institutional repository.

AB  - While the business models used in most segments of the media industry have been profoundly changed by the Internet, surprisingly little has changed in the publishing of scholarly peer reviewed journals. Electronic delivery has become the norm, but the same publishers as before are still dominating the market, selling content to subscribers. This article asks the question why Open Access (OA) to the output of mainly publicly funded research hasn't yet become the mainstream business model. OA implies a reversal of the revenue logic from readers paying for content to authors paying for dissemination in form of universal free access. The current situation is analyzed using Porter's five forces model. The analysis demonstrates a lack of competitive pressure in this industry, leading to so high profit levels of the leading publishers that they have not yet felt a strong need to change the way they operate. OA funded by article publishing charges (APCs) might nevertheless start rapidly becoming more common. The driving forces of change currently consist of the public research funders and administrations in Europe, which are pushing for OA by starting dedicated funds for paying the APCs of authors from the respective countries. This has in turn lead to a situation in which publishers have introduced "big deals" involving the bundling of (a) subscription to all their journals, (b) APCs for their hybrid journals and (c) in the future also APCs to their full OA journals. This appears to be a relatively risk free strategy for the leading publishers to retain both their dominance of the market and high profit levels.

AB  - This study used all-journal data and systematic random sampling data to primarily determine the average number of issues per year and the average number of articles per issue among the Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD) (China), and Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index (CSSCI) (China) journals. The random sampling data were based on 5% SCI and SSCI samples and 10% CSCD and CSSCI samples. The objectives were to have a 2018–2019 record of the journal publication frequency detailing the number of articles per issue and the number of issues per year for the journals on the lists, as well as to compare Chinese journals’ data with those of international journals, in the perspective of scholarly publishing transformations in the world as well as in China during the past two decades. The study found that the average number of issues per year for SCI, SSCI, CSCD, and CSSCI journals was 10.95, 5.18, 9.17, and 7.87, respectively, and that CSCD/CSSCI journals publish more articles than SCI/SSCI, with CSSCI journals publishing significantly more articles per year than SSCI journals. The author fees for non-OA journals in China could play a role in the higher number of articles. The “mega journal” phenomenon does not seem to be a common practice among all the journal lists studied.

AB  - “Publication is the hard currency of science. It is the primary yardstick for establishing priority of discovery, making the status of a publication a critical factor in resolving priority disputes or intellectual property claims.” (International Working Group, 2000) Nurse authors, especially those just starting out with publishing their work, may be unsure about which type of publication it is best to aim for. The purpose of this article is to assist in making this choice. The objective is to show what makes a publication scholarly, what an editor looks for when deciding to publish an article, and lastly the peer review process. This will help nurse authors to decide whether a peer-reviewed publication is the appropriate place for their articles, and the process used by editors when deciding whether to accept articles. ‘Scholarly publishing is a communicative practice within a community’ and ‘an activity engaged in by scholars who primarily want their reports to be widely read and credited by their target audience’ (Kling and McKim 1999 p.890). Scholarly publication is a social process, not an activity undertaken in isolation, as often other scholars review, test and critique the information presented. As Borgman (2000 p. 412) explained, ‘research in all fields is incomplete until it is validated through review processes and shared with others‘. Scholarly publication is most often divided into three stages: first, informal communication, which now occurs largely through the use of electronic media (Gabbay, 2000); second, the initial public dissemination of research through conferences and proceedings, and finally, formal publication i.e. in journals or books, chapters in books, articles, on-line formal and public proceedings, most of which are peer-reviewed (Graham, 2000). These formal publications are often the result of extensive review of literature (meta-analysis), personal clinical experiences (case studies) or rigorous research. As they seek opportunities to publish their work, scholars may find it difficult to determine which source is the best especially in terms of what is scholarly and what is not (Rozenzweiz, 1999). There are three key ways to identify a scholarly publication. The first question to ask is: Who does the writing? In a scholarly publication the writing of the manuscript is done by a scholar/researcher in the field. They have the education and credentials that assure the reader that they have the knowledge to write on the topic. The scholar/researcher is reporting on the results of work for which they are responsible. In more popular publications some of the writing may be done by a staff writer, who is most often a professional reporter or a journalist. They interview others and report information learned. They have not done the research or the review or experienced the clinical case study, but instead report on work done by someone other than themselves. Some of the writing may also be done by nurses, but in a more reader-friendly and less academic style that will appeal to busy practitioners who do not have the time or confidence to read scholarly journals. However, these popular publications often publish information that is based on research or other types of evidence and can be used to develop or improve practice. Examples of such popular nursing publications are Nursing Times in the UK, Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners in the USA and Australian Electronic Journal of Nursing Education (AEJNE) in Australia. The second question to ask is: Who are the readers? Scholarly publications are intended to be read by other scholars interested in the same field or discipline. Nurse educators also draw on these kinds of publications for their teaching, and recommend them on reading lists for their students. More popular publications are intended to be read by general readers. The articles often omit features that a researcher would want to know, such as statistics or probability information, and focus more on the ‘take home message’ or practical implications of the topic. The third question to ask is: Is the publication peer reviewed? Manuscripts submitted to scholarly publications are sent for review to other scholars or researchers who have expertise in the topic discussed. These reviewers critique the manuscript and make recommendations on whether or not it should be published. This process is called peer review and is extremely important in determining whether the manuscript is noteworthy. It will determine if the manuscript is appropriate for their publication and if it meets the rigor expected of articles published. As mentioned above, peer review is the key to determining whether a manuscript is scholarly or not. Before a manuscript can be published in most scientific journals, it must be reviewed by colleagues (“peers”) who are experts in the topic written about in the manuscript. Peer review is a method of providing a system of determining quality of material to be published and assuring readers that the information they read is reliable and valid – worth their attention and time. Why is peer review so important? In this process, each article undergoes “blind” or anonymous review by a group of “peers” (scholars with similar expertise and education). These “peers” are the experts, scholars and colleagues of those who themselves write articles and books, and are often university professors. Most peer reviewers have extensive publishing experience on the research or topic on which the article or book focuses. “Blind” peer review is the most reliable and valid form of peer review process because the reviewers do not know the authors' names or university affiliations. This protects the reviewers' ability to give constructive criticism without fear of reprisal from an offended author (Scarry 1991). Authors benefit from the blind review in that, if a manuscript is poorly written, their careers are not jeopardized because the reviewers would have no means of identifying who the authors are. After the peer reviewers have completed their reviews, they are forwarded to the author with recommendations that the manuscript is ready for publication as it stands (very rarely); the manuscript is suitable for publication if certain modifications can be made, questions answered and any errors corrected; or the manuscript is not suitable for publication and has been rejected. The manuscript may be suitable for publication but does not fit the particular focus of the journal, and the reviewers or editor may suggest submitting it to a different journal. Only in the first two cases will the manuscript reach print, and in the second it will probably be returned to the reviewers for another round of scrutiny before actual acceptance for publication. This is what makes peer-reviewed scholarly publications so valuable. Choosing the most appropriate scholarly publication is vital to an author's publishing success. As well as the points discussed in this article, an early step is to check out possible journals by looking at hard copies in an academic library or by going to journals' websites. These websites will also take you to each journal's author guidelines, which need to be applied as closely as possible to improve the articles chances of success.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study examines aspects of scholarly journal publishing in the Nordic countries. On average half of Nordic journals publish online. In most Nordic countries, commercial publishers predominate; however, in Finland the majority are society publishers. The number of open access journals is low, in line with international figures. There is concern to maintain local languages in journal publishing. A majority of the journals publishing in local languages are within social science, humanities, and arts; the STM sector publishes in English. English‐language publications are favoured in research assessments, international recognition, and impact, while the visibility of local‐language scholarly journals in international databases is low. The Nordbib program supports Nordic scholarly journals and fosters co‐operation with publishing companies and learned societies over migration to e‐publishing; it also supports open access. The article discusses future challenges for journal publishing, pointing out the problems of small journal publishers and the need for co‐operation between stakeholders.

AB  - The cost of access to scholarly research creates inequity for readers with varying resources. Open access publishing is an avenue to address this inequity. This research employed a survey of scholars to discover what they know and think about open access. The survey elicited both faculty and doctoral student perspectives. Data were analyzed according to rank and discipline. Although the majority of scholars across disciplines agreed that their work should be freely available to all readers, there were significant differences between disciplines regarding whether scholars had distributed their publications through open access. The survey instrument was examined through Exploratory Factor Analysis.

AB  - The system of scholarly publishing was established four centuries ago to serve scholars and researchers in disseminating, registering, and archiving their works and maintaining quality control. In many ways, the twenty-first-century journals are not so different from their early predecessors, and they continue to serve these multiple functions in an effective way. As in the past, journal editors manage peer review and referee databases, and authors write in linear text and build on previous knowledge through citations and reference links. Publishers bundle articles into issues and disseminate these physical objects. Librarians continue to manage physical storage on library shelves while publishers have created vast digital PDF warehouses. However, some fundamental changes are also taking place in scholarly publishing, presenting opportunities and challenges for researchers, publishers, and librarians. One such trend is the relentless growth in the size of the research base itself. Data from the Journal Citation Report (Thomson Reuters) illustrate this growth. In 2008 there were 960 journals, publishing a total of 220 000 articles in physics and related areas. In 1998, the corresponding figures were 720 and 140 000, representing 35% and 56% growth rates, respectively. The emergence of new research areas, such as nanoscience and nanotechnology, fuels part of this growth. The largest single growth factor, however, is the volume of published research from China, the result of China becoming a world power in science. The growth in the volume of published research puts pressure on established editorial processes and peer review systems, and affects referees’ willingness to engage in peer review—one of the essential pillars of the current system. The growing number of journals (look at the number of Nature progeny compared to ten years ago!) means that it has never been a better time to be an author—There are journals of all shapes and sizes to accommodate every author's needs. For editors and publishers, it means that the competition to attract authors of best research to a journal is more intense. In contrast, library budgets have not tracked this growth in published research. The pressure has been alleviated to some extent by the creation of new pricing models, and library purchasing consortia that have effectively reduced the unit cost of information and had the added benefit of providing greater online access to more journals than ever before. (In some cases, it is not individual subscribers who are customers but whole countries, via their Ministry of Education or Research using a national funding mechanism and pricing formula.) Most obviously, the internet has had a major impact on scholarly publishing. Systems required to publish a journal are now web based. For example, the American Institute of Physics (AIP) conducts web peer review using its Peer X-Press system, and accomplishes online distribution via its journal hosting system Scitation. These systems have proven very popular with authors and readers; in 2009, Scitation delivered more than full-text downloads. While most publishers have digitized back issues of journals (back to volume one in many cases), creating huge PDF warehouses, they have done little so far to address one of the persistent desires researchers express: How do I find the information I need to do my teaching and research and keep up to date? With the growing information overabundance, it is paramount that publishers begin to address this need and deliver better value by using informatics and semantic technologies to extract meaning from the large body of research now being held in the PDF warehouses. AIP is addressing this challenge by becoming an informatics-based publisher, not just a document-centric PDF publisher. Another emerging trend around the world is that governments and other funding bodies are taking a greater interest in the outputs of research that they fund as one way to promote public access. Some funding agencies have mandated that authors must deposit articles resulting from the research they fund in an institutional or subject repository at some point after the version of record has been published in a journal. In most cases, these repositories provide access to their content with no access restrictions. The embargoes between publication in a journal and open access in a repository typically range from 6 to 12 months. Within the above context, open access continues to attract a lot of attention as a business model. Publishers such as Public Library of Science and BioMed Central are open access publishers, where the author is required to pay a fee to publish and readers can access the content of these so-called OA journals at no charge. Authors’ interests in this type of arrangement vary depending on their subject fields and willingness to pay an author fee, which ranges from $1000 to $3000 per article. While there is traction for this model in some biomedical areas, there seems to be little interest, so far, in fields such as physics and chemistry. In contrast, the more familiar business model involves libraries paying a license fee or subscription to provide access to its patrons. Thus, scholarly publishing seems to be caught between two worlds that complement each other in certain ways and contrast in others. There is a world of mass linear information overabundance, and a world of relevant knowledge discoverability, business models that focus on author side or reader side payment models; multiple versions of content sit in repositories and on journal websites, all combined with a general eastward (Asia Pacific) shift in the “center of gravity” of research. There is considerable tension between these worlds. One way forward is to enhance value starting with the understanding of the true needs of scholars and researchers and responding to those needs more effectively in the online world. This will involve more than just incremental steps or using tried and tested models that have been in place for many years. Scholarly publishing will not only involve some form of validation and quality control mechanisms but also be more closely connected to researchers’ work flows, providing information they need when and where they need it in the research process. “Flat” PDFs that publishers so efficiently produce today will not be enough. While the old world of scholarly publishing is waning, the new world is emerging slowly through innovation and collaboration and by ensuring sustainable business models.

AB  - The peer-review crisis is posing a risk to the scholarly peer-reviewed journal system. Journals have to ask many potential peer reviewers to obtain a minimum acceptable number of peers accepting reviewing a manuscript. Several solutions have been suggested to overcome this shortage. From reimbursing for the job, to eliminating pre-publication reviews, one cannot predict which is more dangerous for the future of scholarly publishing. And, why not acknowledging their contribution to the final version of the article published? PubMed created two categories of contributors: authors [AU] and collaborators [IR]. Why not a third category for the peer-reviewer?

AB  - The increasing momentum towards opening up various dimensions of society is discussed in this article, and the authors consider whether ‘open’ is now an unstoppable force for change in the world. Various topics within research communication, such as open access (OA) and post-publication peer review (PPPR), are considered from the perspective of the authors as participants in the scholarly communication community of more than 20 years’ standing, with both for- and non-profit credentials.The authors explore how harnessing the wisdom of the crowd in rating everyday services manifests itself by improving our ability to make choices in our daily lives. They explain how this network effect can be applied to scholarly communication and how it provided some of the inspiration behind the launch of ScienceOpen, the research and OA publishing network, in May 2014. This publishing platform is then described as an example of democratizing publishing. The increasing importance of software development in publishing and the need for stand-alone expertise in this space (as opposed to a publisher-centric approach) is also discussed.Finally, the authors consider the role that the impact factor and the promotion/tenure system play in holding back progress in scholarly communication and they highlight the efforts of early career researchers to break the stalemate by taking ‘open’ pledges.

AB  - How many invitations did you receive last week to publish your latest research data in a journal with a name very similar to those of our classic scientific journals? The reason for this generosity must be the high chance of cheating researchers so that they pay article processing charges. These journals have been denominated ‘predatory journals’ and have interested a Canadian librarian, Charles Beall, to a very high extent. The so-called ‘Beall’s list of predatory journals’ has become widely recognized (1), and today it contains more than 1000 titles. Since the number of ‘invitations’ seems to increase constantly there must be some authors that are accepting these offers. This might also be one reason for why traditional scientific journals have been facing decreasing numbers of submissions for a while. So when such offers appear in your inbox, do consult this Beall’s list. If indeed, which most often is the case, you find the journal on that list, you should forget about submitting anything to them. There is a great risk that besides losing some money you will also lose control of your manuscript. It might just disappear in cyber space or be blocked/lost in a production process that goes on forever.

AB  - Last spring a faculty member asked me to find theirh-index, collect the Impact Factor (IF) for all the journalsin which they were published, and compile the numberof citations each of their articles had received. WhenI presented the results, they insisted their work was moreinfluential than what the metrics suggested. I explainedwhy IFs for specialized journals were lower than moregeneralized publications such as Science or Nature, andwhy citation counts for recent articles need time to grow.I introduced the topic of altmetrics, or alternative metrics,and how they could help this faculty member build a morecomplete picture of their research impact.Altmetrics measure research impact by includingreferences outside of traditional scholarly publishing [1].These social web metrics were first proposed in 2010as a response to scholars moving their work online [2].Altmetrics analyze tweets, blogs, presentations, newsarticles, comments, or any social commentary about adiverse group of scholarly activities that are captured onthe web [2].As librarians have been explaining for years, there arelimits to what IF and h-index figures can tell us. A juniorfaculty member may have created and shared hundreds ofcaptivating lectures online but only published a fewarticles. That teaching is not reflected in their h-index.They may author a widely followed blog in which theyengage with an audience of academic peers, but there is noIF for the blog. As numbers of Twitter followers orFacebook friends quantify social media activity, altmetricsmeasure and rank researcher output, impact, and influencefrom the social web.Before continuing, I should declare any possible con-flicts of interest. I have been a tester for Altmetric.comsince September 2013, and I have enjoyed free access to theAltmetric.com Explorer. Aside from that association, I ama health librarian working in an academic research centrewithout any financial interest in altmetric products. I amwriting from the perspective of an information specialistwho uses altmetrics to track research publications, toassess the impact of my centre’s social media communica-tion strategy, and to plan future knowledge disseminationprojects.I first heard about altmetrics at the Medical LibraryAssociation conference in 2013. The topic of this intriguingnew cross-section of social media and article metricswas heard at numerous sessions. Altmetric start-ups werepushing products that measured research in a differentway, and librarians were excited to learn more.The obvious caveat about altmetrics is that they are onlyvalid and valuable for the most recent publications [3, 4].A 2013 publication in Annals of Internal Medicine on lifestyleinterventions for diabetes [5] received a score of 148 by theAltmetric.com Explorer. The score was calculated basedon 128 Twitter users sharing the publication, two bloggersciting the article, and seven Facebook users mentioning it.In context, the article was amongst the highest ever scoredin Annals of Internal Medicine, (ranked 37 out of 2470). Incontrast, a 2005 publication from the same journal oncoronary artery disease [6] received no score. Social mediamentions are rare for articles published prior to 2011 [4, 7],and altmetric products often exclude older datasets in theiranalysis [8].Some altmetric tools, such as Altmetric.com in theaforementioned example, tell us about individual articlesand others tell us about researchers. Researcher-focusedproducts, such as ImpactStory and ResearchGate, resem-ble familiar social networking sites in that they rely oncontributors creating and maintaining personal profiles.The evolution from Facebook to LinkedIn to ImpactStorymakes logical sense. User-contributed profiles becameonline re´sume´s and then dynamic curricula vitae withembedded metrics for research products. For researcher-focused altmetric tools, older publications, presentations,and products can be manually added. These products thattell us about researchers are more likely to includecontributions prior to 2011, and for that reason they arebetter for analyzing research output over time than article-focused altmetric tools.Because different altmetric tools tell different stories, thelandscape is full of start-ups positioning themselves as

AB  - The appearance of the Philosophical Transactions in 1665 marked the emergence of scientific journals as the dominant mode for dissemination of research and discoveries. The journal system served numerous fundamental needs within the scientific community and encouraged a climate of increased sharing of knowledge. As the rhetoric of scientific discourse evolved over time, a highly stable format emerged to govern the research article as a genre. In the contemporary era of networked science, however, informal scientific communication is also growing in importance as researchers turn to online collaborative tools for even more rapid sharing of results and work in progress.

AB  - was edited by Miriam Balaban, who served as both general chairman and program chairman for th^ Conference.Containing transcriptions of all Conference speeches and formal discussions, the book presents a brief his tory jof scientific editing-and scientific editors' associations; a wide ly.et fairly detailed view of the problems, practices, and at titudes of scientific editors today; and glimpses of the ideas of scientific editors about their roles in years to come.Moreover, this view of the past, present, and future of scientific editor ship includes much consideration-of editors' interaction with authors, referees, and publishers.Mrs. Balaban's preface points out that Faraday, in 1821, identified "three necessary stages of useful -research": to begin, to end, and to publish.The first conference on scien tific publication, however, was not held until 127 years later in 1948, when the Royal Society Information Conference in London dealt with publication, format, editorial policy, ab stracting, indexing, classification of subjects, and training of "information officers."In 1958, the National Academy of Sciences held an Interna tional Conference on Scientific Information in Washington! it dealt with the storage and retrieval of documents.At that time, the "cycle of information" was said to be in the hands of the maker, the storer/supplier, and the user.Soon, however, six rather than three parties, links, estates, or stations, as they are alternatively called, came to be generally distinguished: author, editor, publisher, librarian, documentalist (or archivist, or information scientist), and user.And since 1958, also, associations of editors have been formed in various scientific disciplines and geographic regions.Around that year, CBF, the Council of Biology Fditors, was founded in the United States, and in 1964 appeared its European counterpart, ELSE.Eight years later, in 1972, under the auspices of UNESCO, editors and their proliferating associations formed the world information system, UNISIST.Participating in this consortium now are North and South American, European, and Far Eastern societies of earthscience editors; international organizations of the editoVs of chemical, biochemical, physics, mathematics, psychology, and philosophy journals; and,such regional and national groups as those of Nordic, Japanese, French, and German editors, the National and European Science Foundations, and several pri vate companies.A significant aspect of the movement forjeditorial unity was the formation in 1968 of STM, the International Group of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers.At present, STM is composed of about 120 commercial and institutional pub lishing houses in 20 countries.It issues a newsletter and holds semiannual seminars.Since 1972, these editorial and publishing organizations have cooperated and collaborated increasingly, seeking common grounds in matters of style, standards, practices, and philos ophy; trying to loosen clogs in the flow of information and to reduce the cost and waste which result from confusion, redun dant effort, and fragmentation (p.ix).A short-lived but important group in this movement was the informal Association for Scientific Journals which grew from the work of James Lufkin of the Professional Communication

AB  - Scholarly communications have been rapidly integrated into digitised and networked open ecosystems, where preprint servers have played a pivotal role in accelerating the knowledge transfer processes. However, quantitative evidence is scarce regarding how this paradigm shift beyond the traditional journal publication system has affected the dynamics of collective attention on science. To address this issue, we investigate the citation data of more than 1.5 million eprints on arXiv (https://arxiv.org/) and analyse the long-term citation trend for each discipline involved. We find that the typical growth and obsolescence patterns vary across disciplines, reflecting different publication and communication practices. The results provide unique evidence on the attention dynamics shaped by the research community today, including the dramatic growth and fast obsolescence of Computer Science eprints, which has not been captured in previous studies relying on the citation data of journal papers. Subsequently, we develop a quantitatively-and-temporally normalised citation index with an approximately normal distribution, which is useful for comparing citational attention across disciplines and time periods. Further, we derive a stochastic model consistent with the observed quantitative and temporal characteristics of citation growth and obsolescence. The findings and the developed framework open a new avenue for understanding the nature of citation dynamics.

AB  - For open access (OA) to become a reality, all stakeholders will need to engage positively with each other to rise to the substantial practical challenges it brings. This means moving beyond advocacy and resistance towards a more mature, evidence-based dialogue that seeks to understand all perspectives and find workable solutions. For research funders, scholarly publication delivers crucial public benefits; funders' OA mandates should be seen as tools for maximizing these benefits. The Higher Education Funding Council for England's (HEFCE) policy for open access in the next Research Excellence Framework (REF) has been put together by listening to all sides of the debate, and its success depends on continuing positive, sensitive and engaged discussions between everyone involved.

VL  - 48
AU  - Moussa, Salim

AB  - The question of should editors-in-chief (EICs) publish in their own journals has been hotly debated in academic spheres. Some authors have recommended that EICs should refrain from publishing articles in their own journals. They advocate for a &amp;lsquo;publish elsewhere&amp;rsquo; solution. For EICs and journals, a &amp;lsquo;publish elsewhere&amp;rsquo; solution is unjust, unfair, inadequate, and counterproductive. For manuscripts (co) authored by EICs, an alternative solution is to use an open peer review procedure in which reviewers&amp;rsquo; comments are made public alongside EICs/authors&amp;rsquo; responses. An open peer review procedure should make the submission and acceptance dates, the number of revision rounds that EICs&amp;rsquo; articles went through, and the identities of handling editors available to readers and the general public.

AB  - Abstract Open Access (OA) emerged as an important transition in scholarly publishing worldwide during the past two decades. So far, this transition is increasingly based on article processing charges (APC), which create a new paywall on the researchers’ side. Publishing is part of the research process and thereby necessary to perform research. This study analyses the global trends towards paying to perform research by combing observed trends in publishing from 2015 to 2020 with an APC price list. APC expenses have sharply increased among six countries with different OA policies: the USA, China, the UK, France, the Netherlands, and Norway. The estimated global revenues from APC among major publishers now exceed 2 billion US dollars annually. Mergers and takeovers show that the industry is moving towards APC-based OA as the more profitable business model. Research publishing will be closed to those who cannot make an institution or project money payment. Our results lead to a discussion of whether APC is the best way to promote OA.

TI  - “Showcase” vs. “Selective” Undergraduate Research Journals
IS  - 2
VL  - 5
AU  - Huard, Linda
C1  - University of Saskatchewan
AB  - As Western post-secondary institutions strive to adequately prepare undergraduate students for an ever-changing world, increased interest and investment has been directed towards the undergraduate learning experience. Listed as a high-impact practice (Kuh 10), undergraduate research, in particular, has been increasingly implemented and expanded in a number of institutions over the past several decades, as shown by the growth of the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR n. pag.). With the rise of undergraduate research culture, the undergraduate research journal (URJ) has emerged. URJs run within a university provide students with the opportunity to enhance their education through exposure to scholarly publishing, develop their research and communication skills, view themselves as content creators, produce higher quality work, and improve their graduate school applications or resumes by building essential skills for the changing job market. Despite the variability present in URJ formats, I have defined two broad categories which URJs fall into. Distinguished as “showcase” and “selective” journals, the two types are differentiated by the implementation of a peer-review process with “showcase” journals publishing papers that have not undergone peer-review and “selective” journals qualifying as scholarly publications. With the intent of providing the maximum benefit to the greatest number of students, a “showcase” journal, without the rigours of peer-review, may appear to be the best fit for achieving this goal as it has the potential to see more student papers published. However, the “selective” showcase journal provides the most cumulative benefits for the student, the institution, and the wider academic community. This is due to experiencing the submission process, which provides students with feedback from reviewers; the prestige of publishing in or housing a high-quality journal; and, growing a discipline’s body of knowledge. While providing any type of publishing platform for undergraduate student work will benefit students, institutions may wish to consider the additional worth of “selective” journals when developing an undergraduate research journal program.

C1  - School of Information Studies, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada
AB  - Abstract This article presents early results of a research project designed to further our understanding of how to ensure that small scholar‐led journals can survive and thrive in a global open access knowledge commons. This phase of the research focuses on generation of ideas through interviews and focus groups with 15 participants involved in producing small scholar‐led journals that either are or would like to become open access. Although a couple of journals reported that they could survive in an open access future based on existing resources, most were concerned about survival and none expressed confidence that they could thrive in an open‐access future. These journals are far more diverse than one might imagine. Comparing the costs of article production from one journal with another might not make sense. A number of avenues for further research are discussed.

AB  - Publishing scientific research is very important in contributing to the knowledge of a discipline and in sharing experience among scientists. However, there are few studies to find solutions to improve the quantity and quality of research publications, especially those in the fields of social sciences and humanities. This case study aims at finding the difficulties that lecturers from different faculties and departments of the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University – Ho Chi Minh City have encountered in publishing their research. Based on the survey data, the study suggests practical solutions to enhance Vietnamese researchers’ national and international publications in order to meet integration challenges.

TI  - Some Research Wants to Be Free, Some Follows the Money
IS  - 2
VL  - 62
AU  - Millard, William
AB  - A glut of junk open access journals, pandering to desperate authors driven by the “publish or perish” mantra, is staining the reputation of that new model in scientific and scholarly publishing. Despite the appeal of Stewart Brand's rallying cry “information wants to be free,”1Clarke R. “Information wants to be free.”. Xamax Consultancy/Australian National University, 1994−2009http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/IWtbF.htmlGoogle Scholar the ambiguities of that key term free have long fostered confusion. Does information gravitate toward freedom in the sense of free beer or a free lunch, raising the obvious objection that there is no such thing? The costs of generating and distributing information must be recovered somewhere. Or does freedom in the sense of free speech, unfettered by official censorship, steep access costs, or other artificial constraints, better suit the purposes of scientific communication? Digital distribution has reduced economic bottlenecks in the circulation of research findings and allowed the creation of various structures that offer open access (OA) publication. The Public Library of Science (PLoS), offering 7 peer-reviewed and professionally respected journals (including PLoS One, which has become active in emergency medical research2Greenberg C.J. PLOS ONE: leading emergency medicine journal?.http://openbiomed.info/2012/11/plos-em-journal/Google Scholar), is the best known of the OA entities that have arisen since World Wide Web access reached the general public in the early 1990s. Others include Biomed Central; the British Medical Journal (for research articles, not full content) and its BMJ Open offshoot; Hindawi, a large Cairo-based publisher that has courted controversy but meets most experts' credibility criteria, and that converted all its journals to OA by 2007; and Paul Ginsparg's arXiv.org, which has made self-archiving the norm in physics and commonplace in related disciplines. Supported by assorted mechanisms, including author fees, institutional subsidies, and voluntary or mandatory pay wall–free archiving, OA publishing represents a dramatic step toward an environment in which research information resembles Peter Cooper's ideal of education as a public good, “as free as air or water,” rather than a commodity that can be bought, sold, and restricted to those with the ability to pay. Perhaps inevitably, note observers of the OA movement, enterprises with a sharper eye for authors' wallets than for readers' interests have launched journals that accept practically any article for a fee, perform little or no peer review, and threaten to dilute the credibility of the OA scientific literature, at least in the eyes of the unwary. These on going concerns play on the unfamiliarity of many journals outside specialized communities and the economies of scale inherent in online publishing. The pay-to-publish operations are numerous enough—and enough of a nuisance to researchers, tenure and promotion committees, and scientific communication specialists—to have provoked a watchdog response.3Butler D. Investigating journals: the dark side of publishing.Nature. 2013; 495 (Accessed May 27, 2013): 433-435https://doi.org/10.1038/495433ahttp://www.nature.com/news/investigating-journals-the-dark-side-of-publishing-1.12666Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar The flood tide of suspect publications and related conferences, amounting to “a parallel world of pseudo-academia,” came to the general public's attention last spring through a New York Times article.4Kolata G.

Open access by numbers Blog post, Open and shut?, June 19, 2011.http://poynder.blogspot.com/2011/06/open-access-by-numbers.htmlGoogle Scholar broadening access while maintaining standards through scrupulous peer review. The practice has spread to major subscription publishers as well: Elsevier (Annals of Emergency Medicine's own publisher), Taylor & Francis, John Wiley, and others allow OA to individual articles in perpetuity for a fee, an arrangement known as hybrid OA. Some commentators describe OA as not only a reaction to soaring subscription prices but also nothing less than the future of scientific communication. Yet the movement's quality control mechanisms are under attack during a critical stage in the formation of its institutions and their broader acceptance as a credible alternative to subscription publishing. Jeffrey Beall, scholarly initiatives librarian and associate professor at the University of Colorado Denver's Auraria Library, became concerned about the proliferation of enterprises that he has termed “predatory publishers” while serving as the editor of the Journal of Library Metadata, when he noticed increasing amounts of spam e-mail inviting submissions and positions on editorial boards, often for journals of dubious relevance to his work. He began collecting names of author-fee-supported publishers engaging in these and other questionable practices, posting them on his blog Scholarly Open Access and advising researchers and others to avoid doing business with them. “The scientific article market is flooded with these low-quality journals, many of which haven't gone through an honest peer review,” Beall commented. “They're just polluting scholarly communication.” Beall's list has grown from a small personal project to a more structured instrument with a comments section, publicly posted inclusion criteria,10Beall J. Criteria for Determining Predatory Open-Access Publishers (2nd edition) Scholarly Open Access, 2012.http://scholarlyoa.com/2012/11/30/criteria-for-determining-predatory-open-access-publishers-2nd-edition/Google Scholar and a formal appeal process allowing publishers to rebut the contention that their journals have earned this badge of dishonor. (At least 2 high-volume journal publishers, Dove Medical Press and Hindawi, have been removed after appeal and reanalysis.) Hundreds of organizations and publications have made the list to date by neglecting basic editorial functions (not only peer review but also minimal copyediting), lacking or faking editorial and review board expertise (obscuring their officials' identities or using names without permission), demonstrating a lack of operational transparency, invoicing authors for steep and undisclosed fees after accepting articles and requiring transfer of copyright, letting authors review their own articles under fraudulent online identities, confusing researchers by promoting conferences with names resembling those of respected scientific society events (separated from the recognized conference's name by a single hyphen in one case), plagiarizing material, publishing pseudoscience, and other offenses. “The predatory publishers chiefly operate in the areas where there's grant money,” Beall reported, “so it's the life sciences, for the most part. I can't think of any emergency medicine journals among these publishers … . [I]t's a very specialized topic, and most predatory publishers try to have broad scopes.” The titles of these enterprises are often general, bordering on meaningless, he said, and redundancy is a minimal concern: the list includes 2 firms (one Nigerian, one Ghanaian) using the name International Research Journals and one going by International Research Journal (based in India). Another listed firm, CSCanada (aka Canadian Research and Development Center of Sciences and Cultures), publishes the baffling title Higher Education of Nature Science, instructing prospective authors that “[a]rticles will include advanced knowledge, significant discoveries and the development of nature science at the universities and colleges, designed to lead to critical insights into the areas being addressed.”11Higher Education of Nature ScienceCSCanada [Higher Education of Nature Science Web site].http://www.cscanada.net/index.php/hensGoogle Scholar Beall's mentor William Cohen, founder of the Haworth Press (the Journal of Library Metadata's publisher, now part of the Taylor & Francis Group), described these firms as boiler room–style operations with little incentive to build serious reputations, unlike established publishers in either the subscription or OA realms. Though both Beall and Cohen compare the predatory publishers to vanity presses, the analogy goes only so far. A literary vanity press is a harmless indulgence; the ones on Beall's list introduce unvetted claims into the scientific record on a scale that does nontrivial damage to its credibility. Of the publishing houses targeted by Beall, Cohen said, “each one launches between 1, 2, or 3 to a dozen, several hundred journals each. They just list whole spreadsheets of them all at once. It took me 30 years to launch 200 journals at Haworth; some of these launch 200 in a day.” Arguments that the volume of research being conducted in biomedicine and other fields has expanded enough to require so many new outlets, he added, are “bollocks …. It's well known in publishing that only a small percentage of the journal articles are ever cited or used.” Some commentators see the effect of the junk journals amplified beyond their actual scale. Biophysicist Cameron Neylon, PhD, advocacy director for PLoS, calls them “relatively small operations” but finds that the scammers' conduct means that for OA publishing in general, “everyone gets tarred a bit with the same brush … . There's an awful lot of dodgy behavior happening in subscription space, and people don't seem to pay any attention to that, but that's the nature of being the new people on the block.” The junk publishers, in the PLoS perspective, are “the equivalent of a Nigerian e-mail scam. It's at that level of sophistication in most cases, and it's at that level of obviousness. It's not so much that it's a real problem; it's that it is damaging for the industry as a whole.” Beall recognizes that publicizing the shadow world of predatory publishing makes him a flak magnet. “I think everything that I've done is protected by free speech rights,” Beall said. “I review books, and I write negative and positive book reviews. I see my work with predatory publishers as basically along the same lines. It's just like book reviewing, saying what's good and bad about something. It's just an extension of critical thinking.” Regardless of the salutary effects of this whistle-blowing, however—or the freedom of speech implications—enterprises included on Beall's list have fired warning shots across his bow. A pair of attorneys speaking for the Hyderabad-based OMICS Group recently sent Beall a demand for $1 billion in damages, plus an additional $10,000 fee merely for the alleged cost of preparing this demand itself, alleging that including the firm on his list (where it has been a focus of complaints well beyond Beall's own analyses) was libelous. The threatening letter combines a barrage of intemperate, often ad hominem accusations with nonspecific evaluative defenses of the OMICS Group's quality of work. Another aggrieved party, the Canadian Center of Science and Education, has threatened litigation over the listing of its 4 journals; the owner is a nonscientist Toronto proprietor with a history of involvement in plagiarism.12Brean J. Plagiarized reports from Iranian researchers printed by Canadian publisher.National Post (Toronto). December 3, 2004; (Accessed June 4, 2013)http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/04/iranian-researchers-plagiarized-material/Google Scholar These actions fall under the description of “strategic lawsuits against public participation” (SLAPPs), a common tactic for organizations aiming to silence a critic through fear of high legal expenses. “I've received these before,” Beall responded. “I don't think that … using threatening letters as a business model is very effective in the long run.” Nevertheless, at this writing, his university's legal office is reviewing the threat. He emphatically rejects the contention by OMICS lawyers that his gatekeeping reflects bias against researchers from developing countries, noting that playing the ethnic prejudice card shortchanges the many researchers from those nations whose work appears in legitimate and prestigious journals. “I don't think the western publishers are ignoring scholarship that comes from nonwestern countries,” he commented. “I think they're doing a very good job of attracting the best scholarship, and I think that the scholars in developing countries are just as smart as the scholars in any other country, and they can submit articles that are just as innovative as anybody else can.” Another glaring inaccuracy in the OMICS letter, he noted, is the charge that he wants “to strangle the culture of Open Access publication and would want to propagate the paid access publications.”13Letter from Ashok Ram Kumar and Vijay Kumar, Attorneys, IPmarkets, Hyderabad, India, to Jeffrey Beall, May 14, 2013.Google Scholar Beall has recurrently stated his views that legitimate OA is “a social movement that has changed academic publishing for the better, lowered costs and expanded worldwide access to the latest research”14Beall J. Predatory publishers are corrupting open access.Nature. 2012; 489 (Accessed June 4, 2013): 179https://doi.org/10.1038/489179ahttp://www.nature.com/news/predatory-publishers-are-corrupting-open-access-1.11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar and that he is “not ‘anti’ anything [but] in favor of the best model for scholarly communication, whatever it turns out to be.”15Poynder R. The OA interviews: Jeffrey Beall, University of Colorado Denver Open and shut?, July 11, 2012.http://poynder.blogspot.com/2012/07/oa-interviews-jeffrey-beall-university.htmlGoogle Scholar Stevan Harnad, PhD, professor of cognitive science at the University of Southampton and at Université du Québec à Montréal, founding editor of the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences (an innovator in using open peer commentary), and a recognized OA pioneer, sees such threats as nuisances meant to intimidate through “FUD: fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” The letters to Beall remind Dr. Harnad of threats lodged against British journalist Richard Poynder in 2008 over his investigations into Scientific Journals International, a publisher linked with spamming and an unusual fee structure in which article processing charges varied with the number of authors on an article's byline. Dr. Harnad aided in a legal defense fund for Poynder at the time, though it ultimately wasn't needed. “I don't think anything that Jeffrey has said about them is litigable,” Dr. Harnad continued. “He says, ‘Because of A, B, and C I draw conclusion D,’ and he tells you what A, B, and C are, and those are objective, and conclusion D is his summary of what this means … . Anybody that knows peer review knows that these junk shops are not doing peer review.” Considering the apparent aggressiveness of some of Beall's targets, Cohen described him as “a very brave person to do this … . The only safeguard he's got is, no one's going to go after him; there's nothing to get. He's not rich.” Should the threats proceed to actual litigation in a US, Indian, or Canadian jurisdiction and somehow either succeed—unlikely on a prima facie basis, considering the quality of the claims and, in OMICS' case, the self-parodying amount sought—or, conversely, fail but generate daunting legal costs, a chill could fall over communications about scholarship and pseudoscholarship. Cohen concurred with Dr. Harnad that this, not a billion-dollar windfall, is the real aim of the threats. Proving in court that a publisher's editorial procedures meet or do not meet scientific standards, he said, would be “murky … . There's no universal recognition of acceptable professional peer review.” Because the quality and prestige of journals are vital to academic career assessments, he added, a silencing of Beall's list might also hinder the ability of academic administrators to evaluate researchers' publication records. Here, Beall's efforts complement existing mechanisms and compensate for some of their limitations. Peter Suber, PhD, JD, director of the Harvard Open Access Project, faculty fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, senior researcher at the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, open access project director at Public Knowledge, and research professor of philosophy at Earlham College, noted that quantitative metrics of journal quality such as citation indices, H-indices, or journal impact factors “allow non-experts to judge experts—which is a good thing.” Yet these metrics can be inaccurate and can be gamed. Poor articles, such as the irreproducible, widely disparaged cold-fusion claims of Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann, often have high citation indices because they are repeatedly cited as punching bags. Colleagues engage in log-rolling reciprocal citation, a practice Dr. Suber finds “almost invisible to the world.” Some journals even insist that authors cite other authors from the same journal; “it's unethical, but it happens, and it happens precisely because the impact factor is the coin of the realm.” “Quality is either impossible to measure,” Dr. Suber summarized, “or we haven't figured out how to measure it so far, so we fall back on quantitative parameters that we can measure. It's the contact lens problem: if you lose your contact lens, you look for it under the streetlamp, not because you dropped it there, but because that's where the light is … . I understand why they've turned to the impact factor, but we give it too much weight; we treat it as a quality metric, which it never was.” (He contrasts impact factors with citation systems in law, which count and distinguish citations that approve, disapprove, or overrule the case cited; something similar in scientific scholarship would make partial headway against distorted metrics, though to scale up appropriately, it would require a workforce as diligent as the armies of law students who read and annotate cases.) Lax editorial standards carry more broadly consequential risks, Cohen observed, because scientists are not the only consumers of scientific literature. “The question ‘Who uses and cites journal articles?’ affects public policy,” he said. “Lawyers do, judges do, doctors do, government officials do … congressional committees … a news station. That's what scares me.” In an online publishing environment in which a version of Gresham's Law—the economic principle that a lower-quality currency tends to crowd out a higher-quality currency because the latter is hoarded rather than circulated—appears to apply, Beall's investigations and conclusions provide handy filtering tools. The binary simplicity of the blacklist, however, calls for caveats. “I would distinguish between low-quality journals and dishonest journals,” cautioned Dr. Suber. “They're both problems, but they're separate problems. And the same distinction exists on the subscription side: there are low-quality subscription journals and there are dishonest subscription journals. Some of them are in both categories at the same time. I think Beall's list doesn't distinguish low quality from dishonesty.” The challenge, according to Dr. Suber, is to sort out genuine scam artists from “good-faith startups who aren't trying to deceive or exploit or rip off anybody, but who aren't publishers and don't know the professional standards of publishing. I think for them, the solution is not condemnation or exile, but assistance, especially from publishers who do know the standards of the profession.” A buddy system pairing newcomers with experienced publishers, he suggests, might help startup editors and publishers improve. He expressed a concern that “if the list is not scrupulously assembled, then some innocent publishers will be stigmatized as predatory, and that's a more serious problem than some dishonest ones escaping for the time being.” Beall's list, he speculated, might also serve its purposes well by expanding beyond Beall's own efforts. “Right now, it's Jeffrey Beall's judgment,” Dr. Suber commented, “and his judgment is pretty good, but maybe communal judgment would be better.” Another guide for researchers or readers seeking authentication of unfamiliar journals takes the form of “whitelists”: compendia of reliable OA journals. The traditional criterion for journals, indexing by the former Institute for Scientific Information (ISI, now the Thomson-Reuters Web of Science), is still valuable, but “probably overexacting,” Dr. Harnad said, “because there are probably third world journals that are not indexed by ISI but are still OK.” The expanding OA sector has outpaced this index's growth; the OA community has also shot itself in the foot, Dr. Harnad believes, by “trying to assert itself prematurely.” Claiming “prejudice in favor of the journals that are indexed by ISI and their famous impact factor,” he said, was “one of the stupid things that people who are trying to promote open access said which they shouldn't have said.” He advises beginning researchers to take ISI/Web of Science indexing seriously, avoid the “rah-rah OA” temptation to dismiss that index as behind the times, and aim for “the highest-quality journal whose standards you can meet.” Some junk journals, Cohen added, have made misleading claims about being included in another list, the Directory of Open Access Journals, launched at Lund University in Sweden. This project aims to provide a comprehensive global list of OA journals practicing peer review or editorial quality control, and it is gearing up to perform that function, but according to both Cohen and Dr. Suber, it does not yet have the resources to investigate journals' practices, track them over time, and provide the equivalent of a Good Housekeeping seal. (Some organizations, Cohen added, simply lie about being included there or in familiar services such as MEDLINE, PubMed, or PsycINFO; cross-checking to verify claims is both advisable and time-consuming.) A more rigorous imprimatur, Dr. Suber said, and one not yet on the radar screen for many researchers and physicians, is membership in the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA). This is a professional society based in The Hague, with a code of conduct, a preliminary investigation for prospective members, expulsion procedures if a member fails to comply, and a staff. Dr. Suber, although recommending direct examination of a journal's articles and masthead (perhaps augmented by consultations with informed colleagues) as the best means of evaluation, added that scholars can regard OASPA members as trustworthy. “Now, the problem is the other side,” he cautioned: “if [a publisher] doesn't belong to OASPA, it may not have gotten around to it yet. There's a long tail of open access publishers, hundreds, and most of them don't belong to OASPA yet, but I'd like to create an incentive for all open access publishers to join OASPA and therefore to be bound by this code of conduct … . It's self-regulation by open access publishers. Everything that open access's opponents can say in criticism of predatory journals, basically OASPA has already said.” Cohen suggested 2 other reforms that could help researchers and readers check under the hood: a slight change in standard bibliographic formatting and the creation of “a union list of primary indexing and abstracting services.” If citations to journal articles listed an item's publisher, as well as the journal title, adapting the convention already used for books, junk publishers would be more visible. A regularly updated master list merging the major indexing and abstracting services in different fields would allow authors to “plug in the name of a journal and find out where it is actually indexed, not where a publisher claims it is indexed.” (Ulrich's Periodicals Directory, Cohen reported, attempts to accomplish this, but in his early career, filling out Ulrich's forms, he found that they simply accepted publishers' entries and lacked staff capacity to check them. An effective union list, he speculated, would require “a mammoth effort without producing any income.”) At the opposite end of a scale of rigor and responsibility lies a type of intervention that combines the purposeful subterfuge of Alan Sokal's Social Text hoax16Sokal A.D. Transgressing the boundaries: towards a transformative hermeneutics of quantum gravity.Social Text. 1996; 46/47 (Accessed June 4, 2013): 217-252http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.htmlCrossref Google Scholar, 17Sokal A.D.

Independent researcher Phil Davis, using text-generating software (SCIgen18Stribling J. Krohn M. Aguayo D.

Despite its nonsensical content and a reference to its imaginary coauthors' institutional affiliation with a Center for Research in Applied Phrenology (CRAP), the article was accepted (with an invoice for an $800 fee).19Davis P.

Still, they recognize the point behind the pranks: even reputable professional societies, like Homer as Horace described him, sometimes nod. If review standards can occasionally lapse to the point of letting a Schlangemann past the gates, then, a fortiori, organizations that pay lip service or less to peer review require vigilant skepticism. (Humility and full disclosure require a recognition that established publishers, too, make egregious mistakes: Elsevier, Beall noted, let its standards lapse in publishing several pharmaceutical company–sponsored journals in the early 2000s without disclosing the conflict of interest.22Grant B.

Though commercial publishers have argued that exclusivity is essential to maintain high editorial standards, PLoS has done so—and made a surplus, Dr. Suber noted; “it's nonprofit; otherwise, we'd say it was making a profit”—while publishing all its content OA.

AB  - Abstract Journal lists are instruments to categorize, compare, and assess research and scholarly publications. Our study investigates the remarkable proliferation of such journal lists in China, analyses their underlying values, quality criteria and ranking principles, and specifies how concerns specific to the Chinese research policy and publishing system inform these lists. Discouraged lists of “bad journals” reflect concerns over inferior research publications, but also the involved drain on public resources. Endorsed lists of “good journals” are based on criteria valued in research policy, reflecting the distinctive administrative logic of state‐led Chinese research and publishing policy, ascribing worth to scientific journals for its specific national and institutional needs. In this regard, the criteria used for journal list construction are contextual and reflect the challenges of public resource allocation in a market‐led publication system. Chinese journal lists therefore reflect research policy changes, such as a shift away from output‐dominated research evaluation, the specific concerns about research misconduct, and balancing national research needs against international standards, resulting in distinctly Chinese quality criteria. However, contrasting concerns and inaccuracies lead to contradictions in the “qualify” and “disqualify” binary logic and demonstrate inherent tensions and limitations in journal lists as policy tools.

AB  - Open access publishing offers wide benefits to the scholarly community and may also afford relief to financially embattled academic libraries. The progress of the open access model rests upon the acceptance and validation of open access journals and open archives or institutional repositories by the academic mainstream, particularly by publishing researchers. To what extent are the key actors in the South African research system aware of the advantages of open access? This article reports on the findings of a recent survey undertaken to assess the current awareness, concerns and depth of support for open access amongst local researchers, research managers and policy makers in South Africa. The study focuses on issues of quality, article or author charges and the established academic reward system. It concludes that within the prevailing framework, there is little prospect that academics would choose to publish within open access journals. Recommendations for advocacy by the library community are proposed.

AB  - South Africa’s journey into open access publishing is not new, but it has received renewed energy and vigour. The current dominant commercial model of scholarly publishing undermines the production and dissemination of knowledge in science systems such as South Africa’s, first through a hopelessly inequitable higher education and science system with large disparities amongst institutions and because of the increasing unaffordability of the current subscription-based model. This is a description of the approach being adopted to address one part of the quest towards open access scholarly publishing.

Overall, SPARC aims to create competition for the high priced journals, so that libraries have options when subscription renewals come due. "SPARC and its partners are out to change the landscape of academic publishing," said Rick Johnson, SPARC Enterprise Director. "Scholarly communications will not flourish unless there is an alternative to paying thousands of dollars for a single scientific journal."

AB  - Background: Advances in the health sciences rely on sharing research and data through publication. As information professionals are often asked to contribute their knowledge to assist clinicians and researchers in selecting journals for publication, the authors recognized an opportunity to build a decision support tool, SPI-Hub: Scholarly Publishing Information Hub™, to capture the team’s collective publishing industry knowledge, while carefully retaining the quality of service.Case Presentation: SPI-Hub’s decision support functionality relies on a data framework that describes journal publication policies and practices through a newly designed metadata structure, the Knowledge Management Journal Record™. Metadata fields are populated through a semi-automated process that uses custom programming to access content from multiple sources. Each record includes 25 metadata fields representing best publishing practices. Currently, the database includes more than 24,000 health sciences journal records. To correctly capture the resources needed for both completion and future maintenance of the project, the team conducted an internal study to assess time requirements for completing records through different stages of automation.Conclusions: The journal decision support tool, SPI-Hub, provides an opportunity to assess publication practices by compiling data from a variety of sources in a single location. Automated and semi-automated approaches have effectively reduced the time needed for data collection. Through a comprehensive knowledge management framework and the incorporation of multiple quality points specific to each journal, SPI-Hub provides prospective users with both recommendations for publication and holistic assessment of the trustworthiness of journals in which to publish research and acquire trusted knowledge.

AB  - When a journal receives a duplicate publication, the ability to identify the submitted work as previously published, and reject it, is an assay to publication ethics best practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate how three different types of journals, namely open access (OA) journals, subscription-based journals, and presumed predatory journals, responded to receiving a previously published manuscript for review.We performed a quasi-experimental study in which we submitted a previously published article to a random sample of 602 biomedical journals, roughly 200 journals from each journal type sampled: OA journals, subscription-based journals, and presumed predatory journals. Three hundred and three journals received a Word version in manuscript format, while 299 journals received the formatted publisher's PDF version of the published article. We then recorded responses to the submission received after approximately 1 month. Responses were reviewed, extracted, and coded in duplicate. Our primary outcome was the rate of rejection of the two types of submitted articles (PDF vs Word) within our three journal types.We received correspondence back from 308 (51.1%) journals within our study timeline (32 days); (N = 46 predatory journals, N = 127 OA journals, N = 135 subscription-based journals). Of the journals that responded, 153 received the Word version of the paper, while 155 received the PDF version. Four journals (1.3%) accepted our paper, 291 (94.5%) journals rejected the paper, and 13 (4.2%) requested a revision. A chi-square test looking at journal type, and submission type, was significant (χ2 (4) = 23.50, p < 0.001). All four responses to accept our article came from presumed predatory journals, 3 of which received the Word format and 1 that received the PDF format. Less than half of journals that rejected our submissions did so because they identified ethical issues such as plagiarism with the manuscript (133 (45.7%)).Few journals accepted our submitted paper. However, our findings suggest that all three types of journals may not have adequate safeguards in place to recognize and act on plagiarism or duplicate submissions.

AB  - The paper examines and presents the scale and structure of recent (2012–2018) academic publishing in Croatia, with a focus on academic books and journals, the participation of institutions and publishers, scientific fields and disciplines, and invested financial means. As Croatian academic production to a large extent depends on subsidies, the paper is based on the analyses of data from seven years of subventions, which the Croatian Ministry of Sciences and Education allocates to national academic publish­ers, regardless if they are academic institutions or privately owned publish­ers. Conducted analyses provide detailed insight into the model of supply-side academic publishing and into national academic publishing in general. The topics – academic publishing and system of subsidies – have rarely been addressed in recent research. Thus, this paper offers new insights for researchers (e.g. providing knowledge about the scale and structure of academic publishing), provides evaluation possibilities for policymakers (e.g. to design the tools for monitoring and improving the system of public subsidies), and provide comparable perspective for national academic pub­lishing in the context of European academic publishing setting.

AB  - This essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing, with special attention to the example of Elsevier. A scholarly publisher can be defined as a surveillance publisher if it derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from prediction products, fueled by data extracted from researcher behavior. The essay begins by tracing the Google search engine’s roots in bibliometrics, alongside a history of the citation analysis company that became, in 2016, Clarivate. The essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing by engaging with the work of Shoshana Zuboff, Jathan Sadowski,&amp;nbsp;Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, and Aziz Huq. The recent history of Elsevier is traced to describe the company’s research-lifecycle data-harvesting strategy, with the aim to develop and sell prediction products to unviersity and other customers. The essay concludes by considering some of the potential costs of surveillance publishing, as other big commercial publishers increasingly enter the predictive-analytics business. It is likely,&amp;nbsp;I argue, that windfall subscription-and-APC profits in Elsevier’s “legacy” publishing business have financed its decade-long acquisition binge in analytics. The products’ purpose, moreover, is to streamline the top-down assessment and evaluation practices that have taken hold in recent decades. A final concern&amp;nbsp;is that scholars will internalize an analytics mindset, one already encouraged by citation counts and impact factors. &amp;nbsp;

Design/methodology/approach A paper largely based on specific experience with institutional repositories and the internationally run E‐library and information science (LIS) archive. Findings The open access initiative is dramatically transforming the process of scholarly communication bringing great benefits to the academic world with an, as yet, uncertain outcome for commercial publishers. Practical implications Outlines the benefits of the open access movement with reference to repositories and open access journals to authors and readers alike and gives some food for thought on potential barriers to the complete permeation of the open access model, such as copyright restrictions and version control issues. Some illustrative examples of country‐specific initiatives and the international E‐LIS venture are given. Originality/value An attempt to introduce general theories and practical implications of the open access movement to those largely unfamiliar with the movement.

AB  - It is important to keep in mind, though, that first and foremost, faculty seek to disseminate their research as widely as possible, but particularly to their peers.Faculty also seek success in their careers, and recognized research and publication is closely associated with the promotion and tenure process.As STEM librarians, we continually seek ways to support faculty in our liaison areas.OA is one area where we can engage with faculty and is a publishing trend that we as librarians often feel an obligation to discuss.However, concentrating just on OA alone does not take into account that faculty have personal goals with respect to publication, research, teaching, and career advancement.At least some of our success in this OA endeavor comes through our understanding of, and alignment with, their personal professional goals (Burris 2009).Building OA discussions around these professional goals addresses faculty needs and also offers an opportunity to engender a stronger relationship between librarians and faculty.Thiede (2014), in her essay "On Open Access Evangelism," highlights some reservations that arise as we engage faculty in discussion around

AB  - This article examines the current state of the academic journal. It does so for a number of reasons: the increasing expense of paper journals; the advent of electronic publishing; the use of publication in journals as an indicator of research quality (in addition to disseminating knowledge within a discipline) and consequent criticisms of systems of peer review and evaluation of scholarship; emergent issues of equity and access; and evidence of malpractice. These issues taken together constitute a critique of, and challenge to, the process whereby research papers become journal articles, which has in the past been viewed as unproblematic and straightforward. This paper brings together a wide range of literature in order to inform discussion about the future of the academic journal. It briefly examines the origins of the academic journal and then provides a comprehensive overview of current debates concerning how academic journals work today. In so doing, it raises questions about decisions that will need to be taken regarding the continuity or otherwise of the conventional academic journal, and how publishing practices may change in the future.

TI  - The Academic Library in the Face of Cooperative and Commercial Paths to Open Access
IS  - 2
VL  - 67
AU  - Willinsky, John
AB  - This paper sets out the place of the academic library within the digital-era developments of open access to research and scholarship. It analyzes how this development, now that open access is becoming a scholarly norm and common goal for scholarly publishing, is taking two forms, both of which are about making the move, if not a flip, from the subscription model for the circulation of journals to that of open access. The paper sets out the terms and instances of the two paths to open access. The one is a commercialization of open access publishing dominated by the large corporate academic publishers that are pursuing open access on their own terms through the article processing charge (APC) and in relation to the acquisition and development of scholarly communication infrastructure. The other, older tradition, if still on a smaller scale, is one of cooperation and collaboration, growing out of the commons that the library has always represented, involving libraries, journals, and archives, as well as open source tool and platform development. There is some crossover between the two paths, between library consortia and corporate publishers, and this paper encourages librarians to consider how they might take advantage of the market for publishing services that the two paths are creating amid the move to universal open access as a scholarly norm.

TI  - The Adoption of Open Access Funds Among Canadian Academic Research Libraries, 2008-2012
IS  - 2
VL  - 9
AU  - Hampson, Crystal

AB  - As a result of changes in scholarly communication created by the open access movement, some academic libraries established open access (OA) publishing funds. OA funds are monies set aside at an institution to fund open access publishing of the results of scholarly research. OA funds are a recent innovation in the type of services offered by academic libraries. Adoption of an innovation can be examined in the light of established theories of innovation adoption among social systems. To examine academic libraries’ responses to OA publishing charges, this article explores the adoption of OA funds among Canadian academic research libraries from 2008 to 2012 by analyzing results from a series of previously published surveys. The findings are then examined in light of Everett Rogers’ Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) to consider the question of whether or not OA funds are becoming a standard service in Canadian academic research institutions. Adoption in Canada is briefly compared to that in the United States and United Kingdom. The paper concludes that, as of 2012, OA funds were becoming common but were not a standard service in Canadian academic research libraries and that libraries were actively participating in the development of OA funding models. Given the current Canadian context, the need of researchers for OA publishing support is likely to create pressure for continued adoption of OA funds among Canadian academic research institutions. However, assessment of existing OA funds is needed.

AB  - Bibliometric methods or “analysis” are now firmly established as scientific specialties and are an integral part of research evaluation methodology especially within the scientific and applied fields. The methods are used increasingly when studying various aspects of science and also in the way institutions and universities are ranked worldwide. A sufficient number of studies have been completed, and with the resulting literature, it is now possible to analyse the bibliometric method by using its own methodology. The bibliometric literature in this study, which was extracted from Web of Science, is divided into two parts using a method comparable to the method of Jonkers et al. (Characteristics of bibliometrics articles in library and information sciences (LIS) and other journals, pp. 449–551, 2012: The publications either lie within the Information and Library Science (ILS) category or within the non-ILS category which includes more applied, “subject” based studies. The impact in the different groupings is judged by means of citation analysis using normalized data and an almost linear increase can be observed from 1994 onwards in the non-ILS category. The implication for the dissemination and use of the bibliometric methods in the different contexts is discussed. A keyword analysis identifies the most popular subjects covered by bibliometric analysis, and multidisciplinary articles are shown to have the highest impact. A noticeable shift is observed in those countries which contribute to the pool of bibliometric analysis, as well as a self-perpetuating effect in giving and taking references.

AB  - We assemble a massive sample of 180,000 CVs of Brazilian academic researchers of all disciplines from the Lattes platform. From the CVs we gather information on key variables related to the researchers and their publications. We find males are more productive in terms of quantity of publications, but the effect of gender in terms of research impact is mixed for individual groups of subject areas. For all fields of science, holding a PhD from abroad increases the chance for a researcher to publish in journals of higher impact. We also find that the more years a researcher takes to finish his or her doctorate, the more likely he or she will publish less thereafter, although in outlets of higher impact. The data also support the existence of an inverted U-shaped function relating research age and productivity.

AB  - In the UK in June 2012, the Finch Group published its report “Accessibility, Sustainability, Excellence: How to Expand Access to Research Publications.” The Finch Group, with representatives from scholarly publishing and UK academia, agreed that the broad open access is the way of the future and that the preferred path is gold open access. On 16 July 2012, the Research Councils UK unveiled its new open access policy informed by the work of the Finch Group. The policy mandates that research outputs must be published in journals that are compliant with Research Council policy on open access and must use the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY), when an Article Processing Charge (APC) is levied. The Research Council also announced it would provide block grants to eligible UK Higher Education Institutions, support payment of the APCs associated with pay-to-publish.

AB  - The question about the cost of access to scholarly resources is usually answered by focusing on subscription cost. This study highlights the article processing charges (APCs) paid by Canada’s research institution as an additional scholarly resource. Unpaywall database was queried with the DOIs of CARL member universities’ publication indexed in the Web of Science. We find that while Open Access should in principle reduce the cost of access to scholarly literature, we are rather in a situation where both the cost of access and the cost of publishing are increasing simultaneously.

IS  - 2
VL  - 7
AU  - Joshi, Y.
C1  - Pune, India
AB  - India continues to account for a large share not only in publishing predatory journals but also in publishing papers in such journals. The sheer number of academics in India, the continued pressure on them to publish, and the country’s capabilities in information technology are the driving forces. Despite sporadic attempts to find acceptable alternatives to using publication metrics for evaluating scientists and academics, the number of papers published by them in journals, a metric usually refined by introducing some measures of the quality of the journals in which the papers are published, continues to be the most widely used criterion for evaluating research performance. This emphasis favours predatory or deceptive journals because they offer rapid publication and usually have more modest article-processing charges. To prospective authors, such journals often appear indistinguishable from legitimate scholarly journals. This article (1) seeks to bridge that gap in knowledge by suggesting some ways of choosing the right journals and pointing out a number of features of predatory or deceptive journals to help authors to identify and avoid those journals; (2) offers a brief overview of measures taken by the authorities in India to curb predatory journals and the practice of publishing papers in such journals; and (3) suggests some novel ways other than publication metrics of assessing researchers.

AB  - The dissemination of research findings in reputable journals is a pride for academics as it offers global visibility on online platforms. The purpose of the research is to examine the challenges academics faced in publishing in high-impact factor journals in Nigeria and the strategies to promote high-impact factor journals. We elicit data from 151 academics from tertiary institutions in Nigeria using Google Forms an online survey comprised of structured and unstructured questionnaires, and data were analyzed using tables, simple percentages, and bar-chart. The research findings show that is impossible to determine the impact factor of all journals and that too much emphasis on impact factors could trigger unethical practices in publishing. The study further shows that high-impact journals have rigorous and thorough peer review processes which make renowned scholars publish their articles due to their high impact. Thus, the articles to be published must be original, indigenous, scientific and of relevance to human development and not just copied and pasted articles. There is a need for funding journal publications and continuous training of academics on the dynamics of publishing quality journal papers. The study concludes that putting in place competent and reputed international scholars and enforcement of the ethics of publication will enhance the standards of Nigerian journals and must be easily accessible online.

C1  - Purdue University Purdue University
AB  - When the Open Access (OA) movement began at the beginning of the 21st century, librarians and select scholars saw it as a way to level the playing field by disseminating scholarly work freely, by easing the financial burden placed on rising subscription costs, and by offering alternatives to the traditional publishing model. Predatory and opportunistic OA publishers were quick to arrive on the scene, however, leaving faculty and researchers scrambling for a new and updated vetting process for selecting their publication targets. Jeffrey Beall’s blog and Beall’s List, along with other important publication directories, have become an important part of the effort to provide oversight and information to scholars about OA publishers. This paper will discuss OA controversies and review sources and opinions on the transformation of academic publishing efforts in the context of OA issues. Recent trends in librarianship demonstrate the need to educate authors on how to comprehensively research journals before submitting manuscripts to them, how to avoid predatory OA publishers, and where scholarly communication is going in terms of oversight and reputability of OA journals. This paper will briefly summarize many of the possible roles of the librarian, as well as discuss and evaluate the impact of Beall’s List on both the publishing world and librarianship.

AB  - Without peer reviewers, the entire scholarly publishing system as we currently know it would collapse. However, as it currently stands, publishing is an extremely exploitative system, relative to other business models, in which trained and specialized labor is exploited, in the form of editors and peer reviewers, primarily by for-profit publishers, in return for a pat on the back, and a public nod of thanks. This is the “standardized” and “accepted” form for deriving mainstream peer reviewed literature. However, except for open peer review, where reports are open and identities are known, traditional peer review is closed, and the content of peer reports is known only to the authors and editors involved. Publons launched in 2012 as a platform that would offer recognition to peer reviewers for their work. In 2016, Publons rewarded the most productive reviewers with a “Sentinels of Science” award, accompanied by a dismal monetary reward (38 US cents/review) for their efforts. A site aimed at registering pre- and post-publication peer efforts, Publons was perceived as a positive step towards a more transparent peer review system. However, the continued presence of fake peer reviews and a spike in retractions, even among publishers that were Publons sponsors, suggests that perhaps peers may be exploiting Publons to get recognition for superficial or poor peer review. Since all reviews are not public, their content and quality cannot be verified. On 1 June 2017, Clarivate TM Analytics, which owns the journal impact factor—most likely the most gamed non-academic factor in academic publishing—which is a measure of the number of citations of papers in journals, many of which are published by the for-profit publishers—including Publons sponsors—that “employ” free peer reviewers to quality check the literature they then sell for profit, purchased Publons. Touting the purchase as a way to increase transparency, and stamp out fake peer review, some who had supported Publons felt betrayed, even cancelling their Publons accounts immediately when learning of this purchase. Their concerns included the possible “gaming” of peer review as had taken place with the journal impact factor. This commentary examines possible positive and negative aspects of this business transaction, and what it might mean to academics and publishers.

AB  - Four publishing-related organizations, the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA), and the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME), the first being dedicated specifically to the creation and dissemination of ethics policies, established a set of 16 principles related to journal and publisher transparency and “best” publishing practices. The first, second, third and fourth versions were published in 2013, 2015, 2018, and 2022, respectively. Membership of these organizations implies that members can only become such if they satisfy these principles. This paper compares the four versions to appreciate how the content has changed over time, as a historical endeavor to gather how publishing ethics has progressed over time. An assessment is also made to determine whether all principles are related to transparency and best principles, and if any may be missing. We concluded that the 16 principles offer broad guidance to several important aspects related to journal and publishing ethics and management. However, the vast majority are in general excessively broad, occasionally vague, or lack sufficient examples or specifics, despite the slight improvement between versions 3 and 4. We argue further that these weaknesses may limit their practical application. Until September 2022, there was no transparency regarding the consequences for any members that might violate, or not abide by, these principles. In the light of these arguments, we are of the opinion that the 16 principles of “best” publishing practices merit additional improvements.

C1  - UiT The Arctic University of Norway
AB  - The prestige ranking of scholarly journals is costly to science and to society. Researchers’ payoff in terms of career progress is determined largely from where they publish their findings, and less from the content of their scholarly work. This fact creates perverted incentives for the researchers. Valuable research time is spent in trying to satisfy reviewers and editors, rather than spending their time in the most productive direction. This in turn leads to unnecessary long time from research findings are made until they become public. This costly system is upheld by the scholarly community itself. Scholars supply the journals with time, serving as reviewers and editors without any paycheck asked, even though the bulk of scientific journals are published by big commercial enterprises enjoying super profit margins. The super profit results from expensive licensing deals with the scholarly institutions. The free labour offered, on top of the payment for the licensing deals, should be viewed as part of the payment to these publishers – a payment in kind. Why not use this as a negotiating chip towards the publishers? If a publisher asks more than acceptable for a licensing deal, rather than walk away with no deal, the scholarly institutions could pull out all the free labour offered by reviewers and editors.

AU  - Neugebauer, Tomasz
AU  - Murray, Annie
C1  - Concordia University
AB  - This paper examines the development of the Open Access movement in scholarly communication, with particular attention to some of the rhetorical strategies and policy mechanisms used to promote it to scholars and scientists. Despite the majority of journal publishersâ€™ acceptance of author self-archiving practices, and the minimal time commitment required by authors to successfully self-archive their work in disciplinary or institutional repositories, the majority of authors still by and large avoid participation. The paper reviews the strategies and arguments used for increasing author participation in open access, including the role of open access mandates. We recommend a service-oriented approach towards increasing participation in open access, rather than rhetoric that speculates on the benefits that open access will have on text/data mining innovation. In advocating for open access participation, we recommend focusing on its most universal and tangible purpose: increasing public open (gratis) access to the published results of publicly funded research. Researchers require strong institutional support to understand the copyright climate of open access self-archiving, user-friendly interfaces and useful metrics, such as repository usage statistics. We recommend that mandates and well-crafted and responsive author support services at universities will ultimately be required to ensure the growth of open access. We describe the mediated deposit service that was developed to support author self-archiving in Spectrum: Concordia University Research Repository. By comparing the number of deposits of non-thesis materials (e.g. articles and conference presentations) that were accomplished through the staff-mediated deposit service to the number of deposits that were author-initiated, we demonstrate the relative significance of this service to the growth of the repository.

AB  - With the advent of the Internet and online publishing, the notion has arisen that access to the world’s research publications could be made available to one and all for free, presumably by shifting the costs to other places in the value chain and disintermediating publishers, a circumstance called Open Access (OA) publishing. While there are many hopes embedded in this view (lower costs, wider access, etc.), it appears more likely that Open Access will come about not through a revolution in the world of legacy publishing, but through upstart media built with the innate characteristics of the Internet in mind. An unanticipated outcome of this situation will be that the overall cost of research publications will rise, though the costs will be borne by different players, primarily authors and their proxies.

AB  - A survey of Ukrainian scholars on the Ukrainian academic journals' level and their experience in interacting with editiorial boards of academic journals, which are indexed in Web of Science and Scopus, has been conducted in the Ukrainian Scientists Worldwide group on Facebook by filling out the Google form.In total, 296 scientists from different fields took part in the survey.The questionnaire allowed to gather various, often diametrically opposed, thoughts about why scientists publish (do not publish) their articles in journals included to Web of Science or Scopus; what the main reviewers' comments on their articles were; for what reason the Ministry of Education and Science requires scholars to have articles in academic journals included to international databases; who is financing the publication fee; how important the knowledge of foreign languages for the preparation of scientific papers is; how the authors interact with the editors during the editorial and publishing process; what the main researchers' motivation to write scientific articles is; how scholars evaluate the practice, when people who are not actually co-authors of the articles are added as co-authors by agreement; how the authors refer to plagiarism and on the basis of which criteria researchers select a journal for publication.The results of the survey have shown contradictory tendencies of Ukrainian researchers' publication activity.On the one hand, it is a desire to reach the international level, to gain recognition, an attempt to adhere to high standards, to improve own skills.On the other hand, pursuit of quantitative indicators, low motivation, violations of academic integrity, low level of proficiency in the languages of international scientific communication.In pursuit of quantity there is no place for scientific values, such as novelty, uniqueness, informativeness.

AB  - Abstract Over the past decade, megajournals have expanded in popularity and established a legitimate niche in academic publishing. Leveraging advantages of digital publishing, megajournals are characterized by large publication volume, broad interdisciplinary scope, and peer‐review filters that select primarily for scientific soundness as opposed to novelty or originality. These publishing innovations are complementary and competitive vis‐à‐vis traditional journals. We analyze how megajournals ( PLOS One , Scientific Reports ) are represented in different fields relative to prominent generalist journals ( Nature , PNAS , Science ) and “quasi‐megajournals” ( Nature Communications , PeerJ ). Our results show that both megajournals and prominent traditional journals have distinctive niches, despite the similar interdisciplinary scopes of such journals. These niches—defined by publishing volume and disciplinary diversity—are dynamic and varied over the relatively brief histories of the analyzed megajournals. Although the life sciences are the predominant contributor to megajournals, there is variation in the disciplinary composition of different megajournals. The growth trajectories and disciplinary composition of generalist journals—including megajournals—reflect changing knowledge dissemination and reward structures in science.

AB  - Abstract The Open Access movement seeks to make scholarly, peer-reviewed journal articles freely available to anyone, anywhere over the World Wide Web. There were some very significant developments in the area of Open Access in 2004, including statements by major fund donors in support of Open Access. There are now so many Open Access scholarly journal articles available, that using the resources and related tools is essential for libraries. Libraries can provide more and faster resources for users by supplementing paid resources with Open Access resources. Library resources, such as software that fixes links, commonly named resolvers, are beginning to incorporate Open Access materials and Web searches for Open Access materials. After exhausting traditional resources, interlibrary loan staff members are beginning to include Google searching in their workflow. This article will discuss what Open Access is, the dramatic growth of Open Access, major collections, resources and tools. The article will explore the implications, issues, and leadership opportunities for resource sharing specialists.

AB  - How can an open access publishing and distribution model benefit research in contemporary art? In 2013 Artexte, a non-profit organization dedicated to documenting contemporary art in Canada, launched the e-artexte open access digital repository to offer self-archiving services to publishers, authors and artists in Canadian contemporary art. Although the fine arts community has generally been slow to adopt open access, Canadian contemporary arts publishers, many of whom have small budgets and limited resources, are finding the open access e-artexte repository an effective means of increasing distribution of and access to their publications.

AB  - Despite the increasing number of women graduating in mathematics, a systemic gender imbalance persists and is signified by a pronounced gender gap in the distribution of active researchers and professors. Especially at the level of university faculty, women mathematicians continue being drastically underrepresented, decades after the first affirmative action measures have been put into place. A solid publication record is of paramount importance for securing permanent positions. Thus, the question arises whether the publication patterns of men and women mathematicians differ in a significant way. Making use of the zbMATH database, one of the most comprehensive metadata sources on mathematical publications, we analyze the scholarly output of ∼150,000 mathematicians from the past four decades whose gender we algorithmically inferred. We focus on development over time, collaboration through coautorships, presumed journal quality and distribution of research topics—factors known to have a strong impact on job perspectives. We report significant differences between genders which may put women at a disadvantage when pursuing an academic career in mathematics.

A motivational questionnaire survey was performed, and citation analyses undertaken to determine the publication and citation count of the 45 respondents. Demonstrates significant differences in motivational levels and publication counts by age, gender, caring responsibilities and hours spent on research. Concludes that those likely to produce more publications were older males without responsibilities who did 6-15 hours research per week. Discusses the significance of the findings to employers and suggests areas for further research.

AB  - The use of scholarly publications that have not been formally published in e.g. journals is widespread in some fields. In the past they have been disseminated through various channels of informal communication. However, the Internet has enabled dissemination of these un-published and often unrefereed publications to a much wider audience. This is particularly interesting seen in relation to the highly disputed open access advantage as the potential advantage for low visibility publications has not been given much attention in the literature. The present study examines the role of working papers in economics during a 10-year period (1996–2005). It shows that working papers are increasingly becoming visible in the field specific databases. The impact of working papers is relatively low; however, high impact working paper series have citation rate levels similar to the low impact journals in the field. There is no tendency to an increase in impact during the 10 years which is the case for the high impact journals. Consequently, the result of this study does not provide evidence of an open access advantage for working papers in economics.

AB  - Limited time and budgets have created a legitimate need for quantitative measures of scholarly work. The well-known journal impact factor is the leading measure of this sort; here we describe an alternative approach based on the full structure of the scholarly citation network. The Eigenfactor Metrics—Eigenfactor Score and Article Influence Score—use an iterative ranking scheme similar to Google’s PageRank algorithm. By this approach, citations from top journals are weighted more heavily than citations from lower-tier publications. Here we describe these metrics and the rankings that they provide.

AB  - This paper reviews a number of recent contributions that demonstrate that a blend of welfare economics and statistical analysis is useful in the evaluation of the citations received by scientific papers in the periodical literature. The paper begins by clarifying the role of citation analysis in the evaluation of research. Next, a summary of results about the citation distributions' basic features at different aggregation levels is offered. These results indicate that citation distributions share the same broad shape, are highly skewed, and are often crowned by a power law. In light of this evidence, a novel methodology for the evaluation of research units is illustrated by comparing the high- and low-citation impact achieved by the US, the European Union, and the rest of the world in 22 scientific fields. However, contrary to recent claims, it is shown that mean normalization at the sub-field level does not lead to a universal distribution. Nevertheless, among other topics subject to ongoing research, it appears that this lack of universality does not preclude sensible normalization procedures to compare the citation impact of articles in different scientific fields.

AB  - In this paper we summarise the lessons learned from the first Swedish Read &amp; Publish agreement: Springer Compact with Springer Nature (2016-07-01 – 2018-12-31). We set out to put the Swedish agreement in an international context and to examine the effects of the agreement regarding economy, publication outcome, administration and researchers’ attitudes and practices in Sweden. Publication data, economic data, as well as survey data from administrative staff and corresponding authors were collected and analysed. Based on the analyses, the advantages and disadvantages of Read &amp; Publish agreements are discussed. The advantages include increase in OA publishing, improved OA workflows and ease for researchers. The disadvantages include the risk of conserving the current system and its associated high costs.

AB  - Print academic journals are dead. As we watch large metropolitan newspapers fail (as are many small town newspapers), the same economic forces are driving online scholarly publishing. This phenomenon is more than print journals going online. The options available with new low-cost online publishing software and the rise in the ability to use ratings from user generated content suggest more near-term changes are likely. Many of the outcomes are unsettled: the economics of online publishing; the standards for peer review, rank, and tenure; and the very nature of scholarly publishing itself. What is certain, however, is that the economics of online academic publishing—modeled via Anderson’s Long Tail Theory—will make it possible to provide greater access, more collaboration, and, ultimately, improved research and researchers. Universities acting as publishing centers with their e-reserves will be expected to change their faculty evaluations, providing greater academic rewards for those who act as editors, reviewers, and proofreaders within this new born-online and only-online world.

AB  - Key points Concerns about a crisis in monograph publishing date back to at least the 1990s, and for traditional journal publishing at least a decade. Two key trends behind concerns over book and journal models are pressures on funding and the emergence of open access. Despite predictions of a revolution, the academic publishing sector has proved remarkably resilient in adapting to market changes. Whilst showing some support for ‘open science’, even early career researchers remain committed to traditional publishing models. The growth in scholarly collaboration networks and in sharing across traditional boundaries is the more likely disrupter of traditional publishing.

AB  - Certain open access publishers based on the article processing charges model have found it highly profitable to operate within a gray zone that encompasses both legitimate and predatory publishing practices.In this context, maximum profits can be obtained by adequate combinations of journal acceptance rates and elevated article processing charges.Considering that the gray zone can be particularly challenging to identify and that it poses risks for authors aiming to establish academic carreers, we believe it is important to provide a comprehensive description of it.

AB  - Predatory publishing (PP) is a growing challenge since the emergence of an online and openaccess publishing model 1 .The term PP was first coined in 2010 by Jeffrey Beall who explained that the mission of predatory publishers was "to exploit the author-pays, open-access model for their own profit" 1:15 .Publishing in predatory journals is becoming an industry that threatens the integrity of scientific discovery and scholarship 2 .PP not only wastes funding and other resources 3 , but it is also detrimental to authors' reputation and careers.It impedes meaningful knowledge dissemination due to the fact that information published in predatory journals may not be credible or reliable 4 .This is a cause for concern to nursing and the biomedical sciences when PP is cited in legitimate journals [5][6] or when they are included in evidence syntheses published in legitimate journals 7 .Such citations have the potential of altering results 7 and/or impacting patient care 8 .Of concern, the number of predatory journals continues to increase across disciplines 9 with 'no signs of slowing' -Cabells Scholarly Analytics list of suspected predatory journals includes 17,000 journal titles! 10 Although much has been written about PP, there continues to be a notable lack of empirical studies on PP across all disciplines 9 including nursing 4,9 .In this editorial, we highlight best practices for scholarly publishing, discuss current perspectives on PP, and identify strategies to halt submissions to predatory journals.

AB  - This article seeks to understand how far the United Kingdom higher education (UK HE) sector has progressed towards open access (OA) availability of the scholarly literature it requires to support courses of study. It uses Google Scholar, Unpaywall and Open Access Button to identify OA copies of a random sample of articles copied under the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA) HE Licence to support teaching. The quantitative data analysis is combined with interviews of, and a workshop with, HE practitioners to investigate four research questions. Firstly, what is the nature of the content being used to support courses of study? Secondly, do UK HE establishments regularly incorporate searches for open access availability into their acquisition processes to support teaching? Thirdly, what proportion of content used under the CLA Licence is also available on open access and appropriately licenced? Finally, what percentage of content used by UK HEIs under the CLA Licence is written by academics and thus has the potential for being made open access had there been support in place to enable this? Key findings include the fact that no interviewees incorporated OA searches into their acquisitions processes. Overall, 38% of articles required to support teaching were available as OA in some form but only 7% had a findable re-use licence; just 3% had licences that specifically permitted inclusion in an ‘electronic course-pack’. Eighty-nine percent of journal content was written by academics (34% by UK-based academics). Of these, 58% were written since 2000 and thus could arguably have been made available openly had academics been supported to do so.

AB  - If scholarly communication is broken, how will we fix it? At Impactstory—a non-profit devoted to helping scholars gather and share evidence of their research impact by tracking online usage of scholarship via blogs, Wikipedia, Mendeley, and more—we believe that incentivizing web-native research via altmetrics is the place to start. In this article, we describe the current state of the art in altmetrics and its effects on publishing, we share Impactstory’s plan to build an open infrastructure for altmetrics, and describe our company’s ethos and actions. “Scholarly communication is broken.” We’ve heard this refrain for close to twenty years now, but what does it mean? Academic publishing is still mostly a slow, arduous, and closed process. Researchers have little incentive to experiment with new forms of scholarly communication or make their research freely available at the speed of science, since they’re mainly recognized for publishing journal articles and books: a narrow, very traditional form of scholarly impact. Most arguments attribute academic publishing’s problems to a system that benefits corporate interests or to perverse incentives for tenure and promotion. The solution? Open up research and update our incentive systems accordingly. For too long now, academic publishing has relied on a closed infrastructure that was architected to serve commercial interests. Researchers who attempt to practice open science can find it difficult to get recognition for the impact of open access (OA) publications and research products beyond the journal article, products that include scientific software, data, and so on. Some have already imagined a better future for scholarly communication, one where OA is the norm and a new, open infrastructure serves the diverse needs of scholars throughout the research lifecycle. The decoupled journal is slowly becoming a reality, [1] [#N1] OA publications continue to gain a market share, [2] [#N2] and measuring impact of a diverse set of scholarly outputs through altmetrics is becoming an increasingly common practice for scholars. [3] [#N3] We founded Impactstory with this future in mind. Impactstory [http://impactstory.org] is a non-profit, open source web application that helps researchers gather, understand, and share with others the impact of all their scholarly outputs. We believe that Impactstory and other services that serve scholarly communication are essential to the future of academia. The Imperative for Open Altmetrics http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/idx/j/jep/3336451.0017.301/... 1 of 12 11/3/14, 9:06 PM In this article, we’ll describe the current state of the art in altmetrics and its effects on publishing, share our plan to build an open infrastructure for altmetrics, and describe our company’s ethos and actions. The current publishing ecosystem—and why it needs to be changed Altmetrics—sometimes called “alternative metrics” and defined by Priem, Piwowar, & Hemminger as social media-based metrics for scholarly works [4] [#N4] —are having a major effect on traditional scholarly publishing, but not for all of the reasons you might expect. Traditional academic publishers are masters of vertical integration. Once a manuscript is submitted to a traditional journal for publication, that journal coordinates peer-review, copy-edits, publishes, markets, manages copyright for, and provides scores of other services [5] [#N5] for the published article. In general, this system has done its job relatively well to date—publishing pay-to-read journals. But it has also resulted in a publishing ecosystem that can be harmful to scholars and the public [6] [#N6] : toll access journals with exorbitant subscription fees (as the for-profit publishers seek to expand their ever-widening profit margin [7] [#N7] ) and journal impact factors being used as a proxy for the quality of a published article when evaluating scholars’ work (not the fault of the publishers, to be sure, but they nonetheless contribute to the problem by promoting and sustaining JIF hype). What if we imagined a web-native publishing ecosystem that functioned in an open, networked manner, similar to how much research itself is conducted nowadays? What if we decoupled the services that many journals provide from the journal itself, and had scores of businesses that could provide many of the essential services that authors need, like peer-review, copy editing, marketing—with less overhead and greater transparency? Such a system has the opportunity to foster a scholarly communication environment that benefits scholars and the public, freeing the literature via Open Access publishing, improving the literature through open and post-publication peer review, and understanding the literature’s impact through article-level metrics and altmetrics. Luckily, that new system is in the process of being built. Every day, game-changing publishing services like Publons [https://publons.com/] and Rubriq [http://www.rubriq.com/] (stand-alone peer-review services [8] [#N8] ), Annotum [http://annotum.org/] and PressForward [http://pressforward.org/] (publishing platforms), Dryad [http://datadryad.org/] and Figshare [http://figshare.com/] (data-sharing platforms), and Kudos [https://www.growkudos.com/] (an article marketing service) are debuted. And altmetrics services like Impactstory [https://impactstory.org/] , Altmetric [http://www.altmetric.com/] , PlumX [https://plu.mx/] , and PLOS ALMs [http://article-levelmetrics.plos.org/] are also starting to be widely adopted, by both publishers and scholars alike. The rise of altmetrics Altmetrics are a solution to a problem that increasingly plagues scholars: even in situations where scholarship may be best served by a publishing a dataset, blog post, or other web-native scholarly product, one’s own career is often better served by instead putting that effort into traditional article-writing. If we want to move to a more efficient, web-native science, we must make that The Imperative for Open Altmetrics http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/idx/j/jep/3336451.0017.301/... 2 of 12 11/3/14, 9:06 PM dilemma disappear: what is good for scholarship must become good for the scholar. Instead of assessing only paper-native articles, books, and proceedings, we must build a new system where all types of scholarly products are evaluated and rewarded. The key to this new reward system is altmetrics: a broad suite of online impact indicators that goes beyond traditional citations to measure impacts of diverse products, in diverse platforms, on diverse groups of people. [9] [#N9] Altmetrics leverage the increasing centrality of the Web in scholarly communication, mining evidence of impact across a range of online tools and environments: [/j/jep/images/3336451.0017.301-00000001.jpg] These and other altmetrics promise to bridge the gap between the potential of web-native scholarship and the limitations of the paper-native scholarly reward system. A growing body of research supports the validity and potential usefulness of altmetrics. [10] [#N10] [11] [#N11] [12] [#N12] [13] [#N13] Eventually, these new metrics may power not only research evaluation, but also web-native filtering and recommendation tools. [14] [#N14] [15] [#N15] [16] [#N16] However, this vision of efficient, altmetrics-powered, and web-native scholarship will not occur accidentally. It requires advocacy to promote the value of altmetrics and web-native scholarship, online tools to demonstrate the immediate value of altmetrics as an assessment approach today, and an open data infrastructure to support developers as they create a new, web-native scholarly ecosystem. This is where Impactstory comes in.

AB  - Open access (OA) is an alternative business model for the publication of scholarly journals. It makes articles freely available to readers on the Internet and covers the costs associated with publication through means other than subscriptions. This article argues that Gold OA, where all of the articles of a journal are available at the time of publication, is a disruptive innovation as defined by business theorist Clayton Christensen. Using methods described by Christensen, we can predict the growth of Gold OA. This analysis suggests that Gold OA could account for 50 percent of the scholarly journal articles sometime between 2017 and 2021, and 90 percent of articles as soon as 2020 and more conservatively by 2025.

AB  - Examines SHERPA/RoMEO publisher open access (OA) policy information for 100 publishers over a 13 year period (2004–2016) to consider whether their size, type or country (UK or US) affected the development of their OA policy over time. A publisher’s RoMEO colour code, whether they offered a Gold OA option, and the mean number of restrictions as to when, how and where papers may be self-archived, were all mapped. Kruskal–Wallis tests were run to assess whether the differences between their 2004 and 2016 positions were statistically significant. Finds that the growth of Green and Gold OA policy approaches has not been evenly distributed amongst publishers with some significant differences amongst publishers of different size, types and country (UK and US). Large commercial publishers are more likely to be allocated a RoMEO colour code, but at the same time place a high volume of restrictions as to where and how authors might self-archive. Small publishers are less likely to have a RoMEO green colour code, but the volume of restrictions they place on self-archiving are minimal. University presses appear not to be engaging with either OA agenda to any considerable degree. UK and US publishers’ OA policies appear to be influenced by the national OA policy environment which, considering the global nature of the scholarly journals market, was more pronounced than might have been anticipated.

AB  - The use of peer review within both the scholarly communication system and the UK’s Research Assessment Exercise is reviewed. The common denominator is that of peer-reviewed academic journals, since peer review is used by referees to aid publication decisions and by RAE panel members to evaluate a department’s research performance. We propose that since academic research is now subject to peer review at all stages of evaluation, it is becoming an accepted method of rewarding (by funding) research. The growth of electronic publications (both toll-access and open access) provides possibilities for changes to some of the process of peer review and RAE, but the fundamental model of peer review to reduce the number of poor quality publications will remain. The paper concludes that because of the many criticisms of peer review, it is unwise to base funding decisions on second level peer review of articles that have already undergone peer review.

AB  - Abstract This paper offers a cross-country and cross-disciplinary analysis of the development of open access publishing from 2000 to 2019. Through an analysis of seven world regions and nine scholarly fields, we found that, while the overall share of open access journals has increased significantly over the last two decades, there are important differences across both the analyzed world regions and disciplines. We also found that, with the exception of neuroscience, the proportion of open access journals is considerably lower among the journals ranked in the Q1 quartile of Scopus than in the general field. We also offer a model that explains the development of open access publishing trends on different disciplinary and geographical levels.

AB  - The intersection of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and open access (OA) is a subject the scholarly publishing community has begun to earnestly grapple with in recent years. The focus is to identify barriers to equitable opportunities, how to better understand which principles of social and racial justice and inclusivity can be applied to promote equitable access to scholarly research and knowledge, and strategies to promote equitable opportunities in scholarly publishing.1 By promoting diverse representation, addressing equity barriers, and fostering inclusive practices, DEI principles can be integrated into OA initiatives to promote a scholarly ecosystem that is accessible to, inclusive of, and representative of all.2 Over the course of a day-and-a-half workshop (February 1–2, 2023) organized by the Ecological Society of America (ESA), with funding from the National Science Foundation and hosted by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington, DC, thought leaders who care deeply about this issue convened to share their perspectives, wrestle with difficult questions, and develop ideas for how to move the community forward in a more unified direction in terms of diversity, equity, inclusion. Diversity, in the context of this workshop, refers to racial and ethnic diversity, gender diversity, and/or other forms of diversity. The following is a summary of the workshop’s presentations, written by 3 members of the Council of Science Editor (CSE) Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Committee who attended the workshop. The goal of this article is to provide those who were not in attendance a general overview of the workshop’s […]

A major component of this process is re-examining the fundamental aims of the IR and aligning it to the Libraries and the campus strategic goals. The authors situate UNLV Libraries' experience within the context of the current literature to provide background and reasoning for our decision to pursue two, at times conflicting, aims for the IR: one for scholarly communication and another for research administration.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to argue that the traditional scholarly journal system is outdated and in need of revamp, and new internet technologies provide opportunities for change unavailable until now. Design/methodology/approach The four functions of the scholarly journal: registration; awareness; certification; and archiving are discussed in turn and alternative ways of undertaking those functions are explored. Barriers to change and ways to overcome these barriers are addressed. Findings The functions of registration and certification are already met with an open peer review system in place for some high profile journals. Recently developed searching and browsing facilities give academics access to a greater proportion of scholarly literature, providing a more efficient awareness function than traditional journals. The function of archiving is not being adequately addressed by commercial publishers, and the steps being taken by institutional repositories to that end are more sustainable. The fundamental tenet of science as part of the public domain is being eroded by commercial gain, and a move away from the traditional scholarly system can reverse that trend. Barriers to change are: the publisher's commercial imperative to maintain the status quo; the academy's reluctance to change; and the reward system. However, recently both publishers and academics have demonstrated a willingness to try new systems. The barrier of institutional reliance on metrics poses the greatest threat to change. Originality/value This paper builds on an historical background of arguments dating back to 1926, but uses up‐to‐date examples of ways publishers are moving towards change. The paper will inspire debate in the scholarly community.

AB  - Key points Scholarly publishing is unusual because of the substantial involvement of non‐profit organizations and the way in which they work with commercial publishers. Publishing services agreements (PSAs) may provide predictable revenues, access to transformative agreements, and wider distribution. The largest disadvantage of PSAs is publisher lock‐in, where revenues derived from publisher packages are not portable. Deciding to enter a publisher services agreement should not be taken lightly and must be carefully aligned with the society's value and strategy.

AB  - The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a public access policy on all publications for which the research was supported by their grants; the policy was drafted in 2004 and took effect in 2008. The policy is now 11 years old, yet no analysis has been presented to assess whether in fact this largest-scale US-based public access policy affected the vitality of the scholarly publishing enterprise, as manifested in changed mortality or natality rates of biomedical journals. We show here that implementation of the NIH policy was associated with slightly elevated mortality rates and mildly depressed natality rates of biomedical journals, but that birth rates so exceeded death rates that numbers of biomedical journals continued to rise, even in the face of the implementation of such a sweeping public access policy.

AB  - Abstract We aim to estimate the total amount of article processing charges (APCs) paid to publish open access (OA) in journals controlled by the five large commercial publishers (Elsevier, Sage, Springer Nature, Taylor &amp; Francis, and Wiley) between 2015 and 2018. Using publication data from WoS, OA status from Unpaywall, and annual APC prices from open data sets and historical fees retrieved via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, we estimate that globally authors paid $1.06 billion in publication fees to these publishers from 2015–2018. Revenue from gold OA amounted to $612.5 million, and $448.3 million was obtained for publishing OA in hybrid journals. Among the five publishers, Springer Nature made the most revenue from OA ($589.7 million), followed by Elsevier ($221.4 million), Wiley ($114.3 million), Taylor &amp; Francis ($76.8 million), and Sage ($31.6 million). With Elsevier and Wiley making most of their APC revenue from hybrid fees and others focusing on gold, different OA strategies could be observed between publishers.

Open access is compatible with copyright, copyleft, peer review, printing, preservation and other characteristics associated with conventional academic literature. The most relevant difference consists in the fact that readers are not charged for access to the information, and therefore there are no barriers to research. Even so, the success of the OAI does not depend only on the availability of documents, but also on the support of the scientific community.

AB  - While the open-access (OA) movement purports to be about making scholarly content open-access, its true motives are much different. The OA movement is an anti-corporatist movement that wants to deny the freedom of the press to companies it disagrees with. The movement is also actively imposing onerous mandates on researchers, mandates that restrict individual freedom. To boost the open-access movement, its leaders sacrifice the academic futures of young scholars and those from developing countries, pressuring them to publish in lower-quality open-access journals. The open-access movement has fostered the creation of numerous predatory publishers and standalone journals, increasing the amount of research misconduct in scholarly publications and the amount of pseudo-science that is published as if it were authentic science.

AB  - Cappelen Damm Akademisk has established an editorial division for Open Access scholarly publishing of journals and books under the name: Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing (NOASP). In cooperation with Co-Action Publishing, a pioneer in the field of Open Access publishing, NOASP has established a user-friendly platform that provides suitable presentation, legibility, straightforward navigation, optimal search-functionality and ideal distribution for scholarly journals.NOASP offers editorial support from a team of experienced editors who will steer manuscripts through the various phases of the publication process. The platform is easy to use, for editors, authors and peer-reviewers alike. It has been developed with good workflow, simple logistics and a clear system for handling multiple versions of an article in mind.NOASP was established roughly one year ago. We now have six Open Access journals, three of which are entirely new. We were also the first Norwegian publisher to release an Open Access book, and several more peer-reviewed monographs and anthologies are in the pipeline. NOASP is a member of the Open Access Scholarly Association (OASPA), the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB).The OA landscape is constantly evolving, and as an Open Access publisher, we seek out knowledge and information from experts in the field and connect with important OA-actors internationally, as well as gaining expertise in the Norwegian and Nordic context. We also support and help our journals in the accreditation process and in obtaining governmental financial support. We believe that an important role in being early movers on the OA front in Norway is to be an active part of the evolving process.NOASP provides Open Access publishing on the principle that making research accessible supports a greater exchange of knowledge. As an academic publisher, we believe Open Access publishing is an important supplement to our publication portfolio, and we are dedicated to promoting OA publishing as an essential service to the academic community in the Nordic countries.

AB  - ABSTRACT The recent literature about peer review of scholarly articles is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the cost of the peer‐review process. Possible impacts of electronic scholarly publishing upon peer reviewing are discussed. Opinion among academics in their roles as authors, editors and referees seems likely to insist upon preservation of a pre‐publication refereeing system in most disciplines. As the administration of any such system seems to have a cost of about $400 per published article, any scholarly publishing system will need to locate financial support to at least that extent, and a system of lump‐sum payment by the authors' funders is best placed to cover this cost while providing universal free access to scholarly material.

AB  - Lawrence Kuznar gives his defmition of what science should be: empirical, systematic, explicit, logical, theoretical, explanatory, predictive, self-critical, based on testing, and public (Kuznar 1997:22-24, emphasis added).It is under the assumption that good science is public than many readers open a scientific journal and expect that they are viewing an open-forum of scientific debate.However, much debate occurs between the time a manuscript is submitted to a journal and the time it is published through peer-review.Peerreview, broadly defmed, is the process by which prospective articles are critiqued by experts in the paper topic to ensure that only quality articles are published.Though peer-review is practiced by almost all journals that are considered scholarly, it is far from a perfect system.Critics cite the possibility of reviewer bias, competition, plagiarism, and conflict of interest as a few of the negative aspects of peer review.Others claim that the high level of importance placed on publication in academia today has led to a flood of new for-profit journals which result in the publication of mediocre articles.In light of these concerns, this paper will discuss some of the problematic issues surrounding the peer review process and look towards new approaches that may offer solutions to the problems discussed.Conducting a study of the peer review process is a challenge because journals do not generally provide information about their review policies to the general readership.This is peculiar because, if good science is explicit, it should be expected that the process by which it is judged be made explicit as well.Therefore, this paper will also investigate ways to make peerreview explicit to the public, while still maintaining the integrity of the process, in order to ensure that good science prevails in journal publication.'1'( rn'\j ,-,,11 i 2fj(!•'.'.()(JS C');,,"l'~;h: :',: ,:>00', '['OT[\[: '[h, l"\VOJ'"llTLlI of ,\nrhropol"gy

TI  - The Plan S Rights Retention Strategy is an administrative and legal burden, not a sustainable open access solution
VL  - 34
AU  - Khoo, Shaun
C1  - Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal
AB  - The Plan S Rights Retention Strategy (RRS) requires authors who are submitting to subscription journals to inform publishers that the author accepted manuscript (AAM) will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. The laudable stated aim of the RRS is to achieve immediate open access to research outputs, while preserving journal choice for authors. However, proponents of the RRS overlook the significant administrative and legal burdens that the RRS places on authors and readers. Even though compliance with existing green open access (self-archiving) policies is poor at best, the RRS is likely to rely on authors to successfully execute the CC licensing of their work in the face of publisher resistance. The complexity of copyright law and CC licensing gives many reasons to doubt the legal validity of an RRS licence grant, which creates legal risk for authors and their institutions. The complexity of RRS CC BY licensing also creates legal risk for readers, who may not be able to fully rely on the reuse rights of a CC BY licence on the AAM. However, cOAlition S has released no legal advice that explains why the RRS is valid and legally binding. Publishers of legacy subscription journals have already begun implementing strategies that ensure they can protect their revenue streams. These actions may leave authors having to choose between paying publication fees and complying with their funding agreements. The result is that the RRS increases the complexity of the copyright and licensing landscape in academic publishing, creates legal risk and may not avoid author fees. Unless increased complexity and conflict between authors and publishers drives open access, the RRS is not fit for its stated purpose as an open access strategy.

TI  - The Predatory Journal: Victimizer or Victim?
AU  - Gill, Grandon
C1  - University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA
AB  - Aim/Purpose: Labeling a journal as “predatory” can do great damage to the journal and the individuals that have contributed to it. This paper considers whether the predatory classification has outlived its usefulness and what might replace it. Background: With the advent of open access publishing, the term “predatory” has increasingly been used to identify academic journals, conferences, and publishers whose practices are driven by profit or self-interest rather than the advancement of science. Absent clear standards for determining what is predatory and what is not, concerns have been raised about the misuse of the label. Methodology: Mixed methods: A brief review of the literature, some illustrative case studies, and conceptual analysis. Contribution: The paper provides recommendations for reducing the impact of illegitimate journals. Findings: Current predatory classifications are being assigned with little or no systematic research and virtually no accountability. The predatory/not predatory distinction does not accommodate alternative journal missions. Recommendations for Researchers: The distinction between legitimate and illegitimate journals requires consideration of each journal’s mission. To serve as a useful guide, a process akin to that used for accrediting institutions needs to be put in place. Impact on Society: Avoiding unnecessary damage to the careers of researchers starting out. Future Research: Refining the initial classification scheme proposed in the paper.

TI  - The prevalence and impact of university affiliation discrepancies between four bibliographic databases—Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions, and Microsoft Academic
IS  - 1

AU  - Purnell, Philip

AB  - Research managers benchmarking universities against international peers face the problem of affiliation disambiguation. Different databases have taken separate approaches to this problem and discrepancies exist between them. Bibliometric data sources typically conduct a disambiguation process that unifies variant institutional names and those of its sub-units so that researchers can then search all records from that institution using a single unified name. This study examined affiliation discrepancies between Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions, and Microsoft Academic for 18 Arab universities over a five-year period. We confirmed that digital object identifiers (DOIs) are suitable for extracting comparable scholarly material across databases and quantified the affiliation discrepancies between them. A substantial share of records assigned to the selected universities in any one database were not assigned to the same university in another. The share of discrepancy was higher in the larger databases, Dimensions and Microsoft Academic. The smaller, more selective databases, Scopus and especially Web of Science tended to agree to a greater degree with affiliations in the other databases. Manual examination of affiliation discrepancies showed they were caused by a mixture of missing affiliations, unification differences, and assignation of records to the wrong institution.

AB  - Key points The expansion of open access entails a responsibility for supporting this public access with a guide to why, in an ‘Age of Misinformation’, research may be trustworthy. Such a guide can also provide a check on predatory journals, a fear of which may be unduly limiting researchers tapping into the expanding global scale of research activity. Journal publishing platforms offer opportunities for automating the gathering and presenting of relevant data for assessing journal adherence to scholarly standards. Industry organizations, such as ORCID, Crossref, and DOAJ, offer trust and verification networks that can be employed to further strengthen scholarly publishing integrity.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article summarizes the effects of the increasing global trend towards measuring research quality and effectiveness through, in particular, publication‐based metrics, and its effects on scholarly communication. Such metrics are increasingly influencing the behaviour patterns of administrators, publishers, librarians, and researchers. Impact and citation measures, which often rely solely on Thomson Scientific data, are examined in the context of university league tables and research assessment exercises. The need to establish alternate metrics, particularly for the social sciences and humanities, is emphasized, as is an holistic approach to scholarly communication agenda.

AB  - Open access publications may be a means of increasing availability of scholarly materials. However, there are other drivers which prompt HE institutions to spend staff time and investment on developing IRs. If the publishing arguments are put to one side, there is a separate and strong case for developing an IR which is justified by a library's functions of collecting, managing and curating materials.

AB  - This article studies publication patterns in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in Flanders and Norway using two databases that both cover all SSH peer-reviewed journal articles by university scholars for the period 2005–9. The coverage of journal articles by the Web of Science (WoS) and the proportion of articles published in English are studied in detail applying the same methodologies to both databases. The study of WoS coverage and language use is chosen because the performance-based funding systems that are in place in both countries have given different emphasis to publishing in WoS covered journals. The results show very similar, almost identical evolutions in the use of English as a publication language. The proportion of articles covered by the WoS, however, is stable for Norway but has increased rapidly for Flanders. This finding shows that the parameters used in a performance-based funding system may influence the publishing patterns of researchers.

AB  - Abstract Despite the rising interest in open access (OA) diamond journals as a scholarly journal publishing model, their sustainability remains a pressing concern. Using the Open Access Diamond Journals Study (OADJS) Dataset, we examined the characteristics and factors of OA diamond journal publishing that are associated with high sustainability. From 1335 journals, 476 journals with low sustainability and 438 journals with high sustainability were selected and compared. Our analysis revealed that factors such as the region and official language of the publishing country and the discipline, ownership, and financial status of the journal were significantly associated with sustainability. Journals owned by government or national agencies, those with financial stability, and those promoting open practices like unrestricted text and data mining are more likely to be sustainable. This study also discusses the implications of these findings for the future of scholarly publishing and the open science movement. Ultimately, we emphasize the need for national and international support to enhance the sustainability of OA diamond journals and propose that a collective approach involving policymakers, funding agencies, and journal administrators is crucial for fostering a sustainable open access ecosystem.

AB  - This is the last editorial in the series addressing evolving models of peer review. Throughout the year, we have explored different ways in which peer review manifests—in journal articles, in research data, and in professional practice. It has generated conversations about peer review and its relevance in current scholarship and practice, both positive and critical. There have been conversations and comments about the “flaws of traditional peer review.” I hope that these are opportunities for dialogue and growth within the peer review process. Some of the concerns may be around the “traditional” models possibly perceived as driven by commercial publishers and anathema to open access. Or perhaps it is the opinion that peer review perpetuates an elitist framework around “quality.” Or it may be that the process is not transparent enough and thus, provokes skepticism. Each is a valid perspective. Hopefully, though, the conversation does not stop there.

AB  - This study examines the role of learned societies as publishers in Finland based on bibliographic information from two Finnish databases. We studied the share of learned societies' peer‐reviewed publication channels (serials with ISSNs and book publishers with distinct ISBN roots) and outputs (journal articles, conference articles, book articles, and monographs) in Finland. We also studied the share of learned societies' open access (OA) publications. In 2018, there were 402 peer‐reviewed publication channels in Finland. In 2011–2017, the number of peer‐reviewed publications from scholars working in Finnish universities and published in Finland was 17,724. Learned societies publish around 70% of these channels and publications, mostly in the fields of humanities and social sciences. Learned societies in Finland focus on journal publishing, whereas university presses and commercial publishers focus on book publishing. In 2016–2017, 38.4% of the learned societies' outputs were OA. This study concludes that Finnish learned societies play an integral part in national scholarly publishing. They play an especially important role in journal publishing, as commercial publishers produce only 2.6% of Finnish journals and book series, and only 1.4% of the journal articles from scholars working in Finnish universities.

AB  - Purpose This paper proposes explaining institutional repositories (IRs) and open access, discussing the relationship of open access to IRs, and examining the possible roles of reference librarians in IRs. Design/methodology/approach Key IR and open access concepts are clarified and critiqued. New organizational roles for reference libraries are suggested that build on their current functions. Findings The IR concept is defined, and IRs are shown to be different from scholars' personal web sites, academic department/unit archives, institutional e‐print archives, and disciplinary archives. Open access is defined and examined. While the vision of open access is clear, the implementation of the vision is less pure. Open access and IRs are not synonyms: IRs are best seen as an enabling technology for open access. Reference librarians must play a key role in IRs, and ten potential IR support activities for them are identified. Originality/value This paper orients reference librarians, library administrators, and others to IRs and open access, providing a context for understanding how reference librarians' jobs may be transformed by the emergence of IRs.

AB  - See video of the presentation.Institutions of higher education are in a double bind with respect to scholarly communication: On the one hand, they need to support the research needs of their students and researchers by providing access to the journals that comprise the archival record of scholarship. Doing so requires payment of substantial subscription fees. On the other hand, they need to provide the widest possible dissemination of works by those same researchers -- the fruits of that very research -- which itself incurs costs. I address how these two goals, each of which demands outlays of substantial funds, can best be honored. In the course of the discussion, I provide a first look at some new results on predicting journal usage, which allows for optimizing subscriptions.

AB  - In providing a supportive and sustainable research environment, the institution has a key role to play in scholarly publishing. Whether that be as a guide, assisting researchers through the maze of publishing options and access to specialist audiences, or as an auditor for funders, or as a financer, agreeing article processing charges and subsidising website maintenance. Equally, the institution is the specialist systems developer and protector of the ‘unpublished’ research. This ensures repositories meet the needs of their researchers. In a wider context, the institution is the rewarder of scholarly publishing though promotions and the horizon scanner, preparing researchers for what is coming next. This piece looks at how the multiple roles of the institution in scholarly publishing impact researchers.

AB  - The emergence of networked digital methods of scholarly dissemination has transformed the role of the academic library in the context of the research life cycle. It now plays an important role in the dissemination of research outputs (e.g. through repository management and gold open access publication processing) as well as more traditional acquisition and collection management. The University of Manchester Library and Manchester University Press have developed a strategic relationship to consider how they can work in partnership to support new approaches to scholarly publishing. They have delivered two projects to understand researcher and student needs and to develop tools and services to meet these needs. This work has found that the creation of new journal titles is costly and provides significant resourcing challenges and that support for student journals in particular is mixed amongst senior academic administrators. Research has suggested that there is more value to the University in the provision of training in scholarly publishing than in the creation of new in-house journal titles. Where such titles are created, careful consideration of sustainable business models is vital.

It might seem that giant players will dominate the future of scholarly publishing, but, at the same time, this year has seen the launch of UCL Press, the University’s in-house publishing arm. Goldsmiths, University of London, has also announced it is preparing to launch Goldsmiths Press, a new university press built on digital-first publishing, especially around unconventional projects traditionally excluded by publishers. Some of the more established university presses also seem to be increasing their scope. For example, Stanford University Press launched a new trade imprint and Manchester University Press has announced it has acquired forward titles from Bloomsbury Publishing. Insights asked two experts if there really is scope for the small academic press in the modern scholarly publishing environment. Frances Pinter has provided the perspective of the small university press. She is realistic about the challenges small academic publishers face, but concludes that there is space and opportunity for them to coexist with the giants. Michael Magoulias is equally realistic about the challenges of small, but sees the university press as a necessary, not to say, vital, alternative to commercial publishing.

AB  - This study investigates the use of institutional repositories for self-archiving peer-reviewed work in the U15 (an association of fifteen Canadian research-intensive universities). It relates usage with university open access (OA) policy types and publisher policy embargoes. We show that of all articles found in OpenAlex attributed to U15 researchers, 45.1 to 56.6% are available as Gold or Green OA, yet only 0.5 to 10.7% (mean 4.2%) of these can be found on their respective U15 IRs. Our investigation shows a lack of OA policies from most institutions, journal policies with embargoes exceeding 12 months, and incomplete policy information.

AB  - Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.

AB  - On page 24 you'll find David Kramer's in-depth report on the current state of open-access publishing. Open access and its place in the landscape of academic journals have changed since November 2012, when Physics Today last covered the topic. Besides authors, publishers, and policy makers, other actors are now on the open-access stage, among them charitable foundations, scholarly collaboration networks, and, yes, pirates who post unauthorized copies of papers on Russian servers.CYNTHIA CUMMINGSPPT|High resolutionMy attitude toward open access is conflicted. On the one hand, I agree that the fruits of publicly funded research should be freely available, especially to scientists in poor countries and to scientists employed by companies and colleges that can't afford journal subscriptions. On the other hand, I'm well aware that Physics Today is funded in part by the profits that AIP's publishing subsidiary makes from selling subscriptions to its 19 journals. If Physics Today had to rely solely on advertising and subscription revenue, it would have to shrink and change format.Regardless of where you, I, or anyone else stands on open access, there are forces in play that are hard for publishers to resist. One of those forces arises from the nature of the principal end product of scholarly research, a paper that's usually in the form of a PDF. The P in PDF stands for portable, which is what PDFs all too easily are. For Physics Today's August 2009 issue, I wrote a feature article about iron-based superconductors, which had been discovered just two years earlier. Google Scholar lists 16 unauthorized PDFs of the article, 13 of which are on Chinese websites. (I couldn't find the article on Sci-Hub, the pirate website founded by a Kazakhstani grad student.)Portability isn't the only disrupting force at play. University library budgets have not kept up with inflation or with the growth in the number of the world's scientists and their output. The cash crunch is forcing librarians to scrutinize journals based on price and usage. Subscriptions to those that don't meet increasingly stringent criteria are not renewed.Despite those trends, some aspects of scholarly publishing remain the same. It's just as hard now as it was in the 19th century to conceive of an experiment or theory that is both original and significant enough to be worth publishing in a scientific journal. Reviewing your peers' papers before publication continues to be an unpaid yet valuable duty. And a paper's final version of record still needs to be archived, online if not in bound volumes on library shelves.When I ask physicists and other scientists how they choose where to publish their work, I tend to get the same answers. Scientists want their papers to be read, so they publish in journals that their peers read. A physicist told me once that he regretted publishing in the prestigious Proceedings of the Royal Society because his fellow fluid dynamicists didn't read that journal. Physics of Fluids, he mused, would have been a better choice.Some physicists tell me that if they have a hot result, they'll go for a journal with a high impact factor, such as Physical Review Letters, Nature, or Science. But in the digital age, as George Lozano, Vincent Larivière, and Yves Gingras discovered in an extensive bibliometric study, the correlation between a journal's impact factor and a paper's citations is weakening.11. G. A. Lozano, V. Larivière, Y. Gingras, J. Am. Soc. Inf. Sci. Tec. 63, 2140 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22731One of the findings in David's report in this issue is that open-access papers in the physical sciences currently make up just 10–12% of the total. That modest proportion likely reflects the continuing appeal and reputation of traditional journals. But as any marketing guru will tell you, appeal and reputation are intangible components of a brand. The contest for the best papers in physics will likely be won by the publishers who nurture those intangibles, regardless of access model.ReferencesSection:ChooseTop of pageReferences <<CITING ARTICLES1.

AB  - Scholarly communication is in a perpetual state of disruption. Within this, peer review of research articles remains an essential part of the formal publication process, distinguishing it from virtually all other modes of communication. In the last several years, there has been an explosive wave of innovation in peer review research, platforms, discussions, tools and services. This is largely coupled with the ongoing and parallel evolution of scholarly communication as it adapts to rapidly changing environments, within what is widely considered as the ‘open research’ or ‘open science’ movement. Here, we summarise the current ebb and flow around changes to peer review and consider its role in a modern digital research and communications infrastructure and suggest why uptake of new models of peer review appears to have been so low compared to what is often viewed as the ‘traditional’ method of peer review. Finally, we offer some insight into the potential futures of scholarly peer review and consider what impacts this might have on the broader scholarly research ecosystem. In particular, we focus on the key traits of certification and reputation, moderation and quality control and engagement incentives, and discuss how these interact with socio-technical aspects of peer review and academic culture.

AB  - In this paper we argue that the framing of open access through language adopted by a variety of stakeholders serves to inhibit the uptake of open access publishing through the mechanisms of complexity and cognitive load. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, we analyze both the language and tiers of decisions that confront authors seeking information online about open access. We conclude that this information is for the most part prohibitively complex and introduces contradictory interpretations and executions of open access that act to motivate a phenomenon known as the status quo bias. The only reliable method of counteracting this status quo bias in order to bolster the uptake of open access is to re-frame the language that is commonly employed in association with open access and to minimize the tiers of decisions expected of authors, which create a barrier rather than a gateway to open access engagement.

AB  - Those involved in scholarly publishing are coming to recognize how open access to this body of work can increase its value and reach. Yet no one economic model of open access prevails. Rather, open access is being achieved through a variety of forms that include author self-archiving, immediate (sponsored) open access, delayed open access, and article-processing-fee open access.&nbsp; These open access models are each the result of a stratified scholarly publishing market that can be roughly grouped among independent journals, scholarly society publishers, and commercial publishers. Each of these three market segments is experimenting with forms of open access that hold promise for sustaining, if not extending, the segment&rsquo;s market position. This paper reviews the economics of these open access models, while drawing attention to the consequences of this market stratification for access to knowledge and the sustainability of scholarly publishing as a whole.Artiklen 'The Stratified Economics of Open Access' er skrevet af den drivende kraft bag OJS og hele Public Knowledge Project, John Willinsky.L&aelig;s mere om John Willinsky p&aring; Wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Willinsky&nbsp;&nbsp

AB  - As open‐access ( OA ) publishing funded by article‐processing charges ( APCs ) becomes more widely accepted, academic institutions need to be aware of the “total cost of publication” (TCP), comprising subscription costs plus APCs and additional administration costs. This study analyzes data from 23 UK institutions covering the period 2007–2014 modeling the TCP . It shows a clear rise in centrally managed APC payments from 2012 onward, with payments projected to increase further. As well as evidencing the growing availability and acceptance of OA publishing, these trends reflect particular UK policy developments and funding arrangements intended to accelerate the move toward OA publishing (“ G old” OA ). Although the mean value of APCs has been relatively stable, there was considerable variation in APC prices paid by institutions since 2007. In particular, “hybrid” subscription/ OA journals were consistently more expensive than fully OA journals. Most APCs were paid to large “traditional” commercial publishers who also received considerable subscription income. New administrative costs reported by institutions varied considerably. The total cost of publication modeling shows that APCs are now a significant part of the TCP for academic institutions, in 2013 already constituting an average of 10% of the TCP (excluding administrative costs).

AB  - As Open access (OA) is often perceived as the end goal of scholarly publishing, much research has focused on flipping subscription journals to an OA model. Focusing on what can happen after the presumed finish line, this study identifies journals that have converted from OA to a subscription model, and places these “reverse flips” within the greater context of scholarly publishing. In particular, we examine specific journal descriptors, such as access mode, publisher, subject area, society affiliation, article volume, and citation metrics, to deepen our understanding of reverse flips. Our results show that at least 152 actively publishing journals have reverse-flipped since 2005, suggesting that this phenomenon does not constitute merely a few marginal outliers, but instead a common pattern within scholarly publishing. Notably, we found that 62% of reverse flips (N = 95) had not been born-OA journals, but had been founded as subscription journals, and hence have experienced a three-stage transformation from closed to open to closed. We argue that reverse flips present a unique perspective on OA, and that further research would greatly benefit from enhanced data and tools for identifying such cases.

AB  - Whilst take-up of open access (OA) in the UK is growing rapidly due partly to a number of funder mandates, managing the complexities of balancing compliance with these mandates against restrictive publisher policies and ingrained academic priorities, has resulted in UK higher education institutions (HEIs) often struggling with confused researchers, complex workflows, and rising costs. In order to try to address this situation, the UK Scholarly Communication Licence (UK-SCL) was formulated to bypass the root causes of many of these challenges by implementing a licensing mechanism for multiple-mandate compliance in one single policy. This is the first empirical study to focus on the genesis of the UK-SCL and how its implementation has been conceived thus far. A qualitative research method was used, taking the form of 14 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from the initiative across the UK. The results indicate that those working within UK HEIs are concerned with the complexity of the current OA policy landscape and are frustrated with the inertia within the current system, which has resulted in higher costs, further publisher restrictions, and has not addressed the underlying tensions in academic culture. The UK-SCL is seen by its initiators as a way to achieve further transition towards OA and take back some element of control of the content produced at their institutions. The study concludes by modelling the ways in which the UK-SCL is intended to impact relationships between key stakeholders, and discussing possible implementation futures.

AB  - This paper advances the debate on scholarly publishing and the role of bibliometric indices in evaluating authors and their research, through a theoretical discussion and an empirical case study focused on economics and the impact factor. The rationale of the current bibliometric system is that reputation, assessed by citation figures, can be converted into an objective measure. We instead argue that it provides questionable results, because it fails to properly consider the meaning of indicators built for different purposes, as well as the psychological bias generated by the wrong interpretation of those indicators. However, the potential for abating these distortions exists.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the uptake of the GPRC label (Guaranteed Peer Reviewed Content label) since its introduction in 2010 until 2019. GPRC is a label for books that have been peer reviewed introduced by the Flemish publishers association. The GPRC label allows locally published scholarly books to be included in the regional database for the Social Sciences and Humanities which is used in the Flemish performance-based research funding system. Ten years after the start of the GPRC label, this is the first systematic analysis of the uptake of the label. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our two main data sources are the Flemish regional database for the Social Sciences and Humanities, which currently includes 2,580 GPRC-labeled publications, and three interviews with experts on the GPRC label. Firstly, we study the importance of the label in the Flemish performance-based research funding system. Secondly, we analyse the label in terms of its possible effect on multilingualism and the local or international orientation of publications. Thirdly, we analyse to what extent the label has been used by the different disciplines. Lastly, we discuss the potential implications of the label for the peer review process among book publishers. We find that the GPRC label is of limited importance to the Flemish performance-based research funding system. However, we also conclude that the label has a specific use for locally oriented book publications and in particular for the discipline Law. Furthermore, by requiring publishers to adhere to a formalized peer review procedure, the label affects the peer review practices of local publishers because not all book publishers were using a formal system of peer review before the introduction of the label and even at those publishers who already practiced peer review, the label may have required the publishers to make these procedures more uniform.

AB  - The “version of record” is an organizing concept in scholarly publishing. It is by reference to that version that others are understood and it is the object of financial models, policies, and recognition and reward systems. At the same time, many of the core functions of academic publishing – in particular, registration and dissemination – are decoupling from the version of record. Scholarly publishers are also expanding their remit to encompass other article versions, as well as other research outputs, and efforts to systematically link together and track these into a “record of versions” are growing.

AU  - Kingsley, Danny
C1  - Centre for the Public Awareness of Science Australian National University Canberra Australia
AB  - Purpose By describing some of the often‐ignored aspects of repository advocacy, such as disciplinary differences and how these might affect the adoption of a particular institutional repository, this paper aims to offer practical guidance to repository managers and those responsible for open access and repository policy. Design/methodology/approach The argument uses examples from an empirical study of 43 in‐depth interviews of academic staff in three disciplines, Chemistry, Computer Science and Sociology, at two Australian universities. The interviewees discussed their interaction with the literature as an author, a reader and a reviewer. Findings The study finds that disciplines are markedly different from one another, in terms of their subject matter, the speed of publication, information‐seeking behaviour and social norms. These all have bearing on the likelihood a given group will adopt deposit into an institutional repository as part of their regular work practice. Practical implications It is important to decide the purpose of the institutional repository before embarking on an advocacy program. By mapping empirical findings against both diffusion of innovations theory and writings on disciplinary differences, this paper shows that repository advocacy addressing the university academic population as a single unit is unlikely to be successful. Rather, advocacy and implementation of a repository must consider the information seeking behaviour and social norms of each discipline in question. Originality/value The consideration of disciplinary differences in relation to repository advocacy has only begun to be explored in the literature.

If publishers are to be compensated financially for the value that they add within a capitalist system, then so should all others who add value, including reviewers. I propose that peer review should be included as a professional service by research institutes in their contracts with commercial publishers. This would help to recognize the value of peer review, and begin to shape it into a functional form of quality control.

AB  - We examine the impact of communication technology on scholarly productivity by considering patterns of coauthored economics articles. Using articles in three major economics journals from 1970–79 and 1992–96, we find (1) sharp growth from distant coauthorships (authors not in the same metropolitan area prior to publication), as the theory predicts, and, contrary to theory, (2) lower productivity of distant than close‐coauthored works and no decline in their relative disadvantage. These findings are reconciled by noting that high technology has aspects of a consumer good. The relative productivity of solo‐authored articles has decreased, perhaps explaining the secular increase in coauthorship.

AB  - This environmental scan argues for the value in making grant proposals open access. Applying for and receiving grant funding is an important facet of research. However, accessing information on grant application, review, and award processes remains a particular challenge for early career scholars, researchers from smaller or under-resourced institutions, and traditionally marginalized scholars. While the open access movement has made research publications resulting from funded grants publicly available, grant proposals are rarely included. When proposals are shared, they are difficult to find due to variability in metadata implementation and quality. This work asks: What are central challenges in making grant proposals open access? How can increased access to grant proposals contribute to equity and transparency in funding distribution? What existing repositories contain grant materials? What standards and incentives can be established among grant-seeking and funding stakeholders to improve grant proposal accessibility? This work concludes with perspectives shared during a May 2022 advisory group meeting of stakeholders involved in the Institute of Museum and Library Services–funded project Planning for Open Grants, which focuses on potential solutions in grant seeking and funding processes for working toward an open grants standard across research communities.

IS  - 4

AU  - Dalton, Michelle
C1  - Univ. of Limerick Limerick Ireland
AB  - Objective – To determine the extent to which the open access (OA) status of a journal influences authors in their journal selection decisions and to analyze the sources of funding for the article-processing charges (APCs) applied in professional OA publishing.&#x0D; &#x0D; Design – Survey questionnaire.&#x0D; &#x0D; Setting – The international open access scholarly publishing sector.&#x0D; &#x0D; Subjects – 1,038 researchers across all academic disciplines who have recently published work in open access journals that charge APCs. &#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – Journals listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals were stratified into seven discipline clusters, and systematic random sampling was used where possible to collect a sample of up to 15 journals per cluster that levy APCs. For each individual journal, the authors of the 15 most recently published articles (working from 2010 backwards) were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire on the factors influencing their choice of journal and the source(s) used to fund processing charges. Additional background information about the authors and journals was also collected and merged with the survey responses. &#x0D; &#x0D; Main Results – The results of the survey identified the fit of the article with the journal’s subject area, the perceived quality or impact of the journal, and the speed of the peer-review and publishing process as the dominant factors in the journal selection decision of authors. All three aspects were judged as either “very important” or “important” by 80% or more of respondents – significantly higher than the corresponding figure of 60% in relation to the open access status of the journal. &#x0D; &#x0D; The analysis also indicated that two key elements appear to influence how APCs are funded: the research discipline and the country of origin of the author. The use of research grants to fund charges is more prevalent in scientific disciplines than in the humanities, whilst researchers based in lower-income countries more frequently identify APCs as a barrier than those in higher-income countries. Grants and institutional funding tend to be the primary sources of funding for journals with higher APCs, whilst personal funding is utilised more often in cases where the fee is less than $500.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion – Despite the increasing focus on the accessibility and visibility of research, academics still appear to place a greater value on ‘who’ rather than ‘how many’ readers access their research, and consequently traditional factors still persist as the main determinants in an author’s choice of journal. The future success of the APC model, compared with the traditional subscription-based or hybrid models, will ultimately depend on the ability of authors to obtain the necessary funding to pay such charges, combined with the extent to which the quality of services offered by open access publishers is perceived as being commensurate with the associated publishing fees.

AB  - ABSTRACT Over the last two decades, China has seen an enormous rise in the number of scientific journals, second only to the USA. However, their overall academic level has not been high as expected. In fact the frequent occurrence of ‘trash’ journals has been a very negative development. In this regard, we will define trash journals and analyze their characteristics. In addition, we explore how such journals come into existence and look at their relationship with ‘legal’ journals. The development of trash journals is directly associated with market demand and profit, and a flawed academic evaluation system. We advocate action by government departments to purge academia of trash journals and give examples of how this could be done.

AB  - Research productivity and visibility are becoming increasingly important in the individual researcher’s pursuit to build his or her research reputation, be promoted to the next academic rank within an institution and gain national and international recognition among peers. This paper analyses the research trends and patterns of the academic staff of the College of Health Sciences (CHS) at Moi University in Kenya between 2002 and 2014 to gauge their research productivity and visibility. The names of the academic staff of the CHS who were in employment at the end of 2012 were listed and subjected to a visibility search on the Publish or Perish software that uses Google Scholar as its data source. The findings on output reveal the following: the trend of publication has shown an upward growth since 2007 and is projected to continue to grow as it approaches linearity, until 2025; the School of Medicine was the most prolific and visible; approximately one third of the publications in the CHS originated in the departments of epidemiology and medicine; full professors’ performance exceeded that of the other ranks; researchers at the CHS rely heavily on a locally-published journal (East African Medical Journal) to publish their research; slightly over two thirds of the publications were singly authored; international collaborations were prominently visible; and most medical and health research conducted at the CHS focused on western Kenya, where Moi University is located. For higher productivity and wider visibility of CHS research, the researchers recommend additional funding; publication of the research through a variety of avenues, including open access journals, and the dissemination of the publications through social media platforms; and strengthening of the international collaboration networks, among others. For purposes of further research, the authors propose a study that will investigate the medical and health research visibility and impact across several institutions in Kenya.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper presents summary results from an analysis of the institutional subscription prices for journals in biomedical and social sciences, for a selection of 11 publishers. Overall price, price per page, and price per point of impact factor have been examined for the period 2000–2006. Considerable variation was found between publishers both in their overall levels of price and in the rates of increase observed over the period. There is some evidence that not‐for‐profit publishers may, on average, offer better value for money in terms of price per page and price per point of impact factor, but this is far from conclusive.

AB  - Librarians rely on the Institute for Scientific Information's journal impact factor as a tool for selecting periodicals, primarily in scientific disciplines. A current trend is to use this data as a means for evaluating the performance of departments, institutions, and even researchers in academic institutions—a process that is now being tied to tenure and promotion—despite the fact that such usage can be misleading and prejudicial. This paper will highlight the history of the development of impact factors, describe the limitations in their use, and provide a critique of the usage of impact factors in academic settings.

AB  - Digital academic journals serve as the main dissemination method for peer-reviewed research articles. These journals can be divided into two main categories: open access (OA) and non–open access (non-OA) journals. OA literature is defined by Suber as “digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.” 1 The reasons why no-cost OA adoption is slow-going are still largely unexplored, both theoretically and empirically. However, some influential reasons are suggested in the literature: uncertainty or distrust and perceived lower quality or reputation. 2 Distrust can be caused by general skepticism towards new publication technologies and journals, article processing charges (APC), predatory publishers, and low impact factor. 3 Distrust aside, findings by Björk and Salomon indicate that OA literature is approaching the same quality or academic impact as non-OA literature, in addition to maintaining a citation advantage. 4 To our knowledge, no previous research has tested how researchers’ trust and perceived quality interact to influence both OA and non-OA publishing in one integrated study.

AB  - Responding to the extraordinary challenges facing publication in the digital age is the holistic view taken by the Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAf) on threats and opportunities that characterise this conjuncture.Twelve Years Later, researched by Wieland Gevers, Robin Crewe and Susan Veldsman on national publishing strategies, provides the 'nuts 'n bolts' that every researcher should know in order to navigate the changing environment. 1e Report examines both past and present.The first chapter reviews ASSAf's 2006 report. 2 Chapter 2 revisits the 2009 report on books.Chapter 3 details ASSAf's Scholarly Publishing Programme between 2007 and 2018.How to enhance access of South African authors to global commercial publishers is discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 deals with journal and book publishing, and Chapter 6 examines pitfalls and threats to good publishing practices.Outstanding problems are highlighted in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 offers recommendations.Appendices (45 pp) tabulate the hard data on which the study draws.These data showcase close correlations between the ASSAf qualitative evaluations and Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) decisions.Significantly, ASSAf ratings and reviews of publishers closely align with the international Socio-economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment (SENSE) and the Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals, Series and Publishers ratings.The 2018 Report offers a detailed history useful for individual university policy planning, and implementation of monitoring mechanisms, and explains accreditation decisions.A basic cost-benefit analysis of the publication incentive system administered by DHET identifies residual problems.Notwithstanding these (see below), the statistics tabulated in Appendices by the Centre for Research, Evaluation, Science and Technology (CREST) at Stellenbosch University reveals that DHET has been very effective in encouraging publication.It has also acted as an inhibiting factor in author choice of predatory journals, although many thousands of articles still slipped through. 3nuanced analysis of the usefulness or otherwise of impact factors, and the differences that exist between books and journals and high-citation and low-citation disciplines, is provided (pp 4, 18).This section cautions the current moves by some universities that apply impact factors to rank internal disbursements of publication incentives.

AB  - This study assessed characteristics of publishers who published 2010 open access (OA) journals indexed in Scopus. Publishers were categorized into six types; professional, society, university, scholar/researcher, government, and other organizations. Type of publisher was broken down by number of journals/articles published in 2010, funding model, location, discipline and whether the journal was born or converted to OA. Universities and societies accounted for 50% of the journals and 43% of the articles published. Professional publisher accounted for a third of the journals and 42% of the articles. With the exception of professional and scholar/researcher publishers, most journals were originally subscription journals that made at least their digital version freely available. Arts, humanities and social science journals are largely published by societies and universities outside the major publishing countries. Professional OA publishing is most common in biomedicine, mathematics, the sciences and engineering. Approximately a quarter of the journals are hosted on national/international platforms, in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia largely published by universities and societies without the need for publishing fees. This type of collaboration between governments, universities and/or societies may be an effective means of expanding open access publications.

AB  - Budget cutbacks are the theme of the '90s, and all aspects of advanced education are under intense pressure from severely reduced federal and provincial funding. The realm of scholarly communication is no exception. At a time of rising production costs, reduced postal subsidies, and subscription cancellations from under-funded university libraries, publishers of scholarly journals are now faced with the outright elimination of funding sources such as the Scientific Publication Grants Program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). According to NSERC, the support of scientific journals is a "non-core program" and is therefore being terminated to allow more funding to be directed to research grants. It is difficult to understand how the dissemination of knowledge came to be defined as a non-core program. The goal of ensuring adequate funds for the direct costs of conducting research is certainly laudable. Nevertheless, the loss, through inadequate funding, of scholarly journals as a major forum for scientists to communicate the results of their work has serious consequences for the entire scientific endeavour. There is little point in funding research that will remain unknown to the broader academic community and to Canadian tax-payers who support that community. Such a move could easily result in the research being available only to a privileged few (relatively speaking) through informal networks of communication such as the Internet. ... The move to on-line publishing may somewhat ease the budgetary pressures on journal support programs and university libraries as more and more new journals are offered directly in the electronic media rather than in print. ... Until such time as the print journal has disappeared, publishers will continue to seek ways to make the production process as efficient and cost-effective as possible, while maintaining the quality and integrity of scholarly journals. ... Fiscally responsible journal management means maintaining subscriber rates that will cover the costs of production and distribution. But we need to look elsewhere to cover the myriad other costs associated with scholarly publishing. ...

AB  - Internationalization is important for research quality and for specialization on new themes in the social sciences and humanities (SSH). Interaction with society, however, is just as important in these areas of research for realizing the ultimate aims of knowledge creation. This article demonstrates how the heterogenous publishing patterns of the SSH may reflect and fulfill both purposes. The limited coverage of the SSH in Scopus and Web of Science is discussed along with ideas about how to achieve a more complete representation of all the languages and publication types that are actually used in the SSH. A dynamic and empirical concept of balanced multilingualism is introduced to support combined strategies for internationalization and societal interaction. The argument is that all the communication purposes in all different areas of research, and all the languages and publication types needed to fulfill these purposes, should be considered in a holistic manner without exclusions or priorities whenever research in the SSH is evaluated.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the development of open knowledge in China through two case studies: the development of Chinese open access (OA) journals, and national-level OA repositories. Open access and open knowledge are emerging as a site of both grass-roots activism, and top-down intervention in the practices of scholarship and scholarly publishing in China. Although the language, vision and strategies of the global open knowledge movement are undoubtedly present, so too are the messy realities of open access and open knowledge innovation in a local context. In attempting to position open access developments in China within a diverse and contested global landscape of open knowledge innovation we draw on Moore’s (2017) conception of open access as a boundary object: an object that is understood differently within individual communities but which maintains enough structure to be understood between communities (Moore 2017; Star and Griesemer 1989). Viewed as a boundary object, the concept of open knowledge is making it possible for China to engage with the global open knowledge movement, as a beneficiary of the innovation of others, and as an open knowledge innovator in its own right.

A better understanding of the challenges faced by researchers who are not native English speakers will enable journal publishers to improve the process of submission for all authors, ensuring that the best papers are published in an efficient manner. We surveyed a sample of international researchers to determine what they perceived as challenges inherent to submission to English‐language journals and found that they desire assistance with manuscript formatting and responding to reviewers, as well as clear policies about pre‐submission inquiries and conflicts of interest. Taking into account these survey results and the experience our company has with international authors, we suggest several small changes to a journal's website, including clearer English and prominent links to select policies and guidelines, that may greatly simplify the submission process for second language authors.

AB  - This exploratory study investigates the perceptions and experiences of a group of institutional repository (IR) stakeholders seldom heard from: end-users. We interviewed twenty IR end-users recruited through five IRs to discover how they characterize the IR, how/why they use the IR, their credibility judgments in relation to the IR, and their willingness to return to and/or recommend the IR. Despite our small sample size, we were able to ascertain that IR end-users, although not yet loyal IR devotees, recognize their value and unique nature. Our findings also revealed several areas for improvement, such as lack of visibility and transparency

AB  - Abstract Inspired by The Metric Tide report (2015) on the role of metrics in research assessment and management, and Lord Nicholas Stern’s report Building on Success and Learning from Experience (2016), which deals with criticisms of REF2014 and gives advice for a redesign of REF2021, this article discusses the possible implications for other countries. It also contributes to the discussion of the future of the REF by taking an international perspective. The article offers a framework for understanding differences in the motivations and designs of performance-based research funding systems (PRFS) across countries. It also shows that a basis for mutual learning among countries is more needed than a formulation of best practice, thereby both contributing to and correcting the international outlook in The Metric Tide report and its supplementary Literature Review.

AB  - The advent of policies at research-funding organizations requiring grantees to make their funded research openly accessible alters the life cycle of scholarly research. This survey-based study explores the approaches that libraries and research administration offices at the major Canadian universities are employing to support the research-production cycle in an open access era and, in particular, to support researcher adherence to funder open-access requirements. Responses from 21 universities indicated that librarians feel a strong sense of mandate to carry out open access-related activities and provide research supports, while research administrators have a lower sense of mandate and awareness and instead focus largely on assisting researchers with securing grant funding. Canadian research universities already contain infrastructure that could be leveraged to support open access, but maximizing these opportunities requires that research administration offices and university libraries work together more synergistically than they have done traditionally.&#x0D;

AB  - While inequalities in science are common, most efforts to understand them treat scientists as isolated individuals, ignoring the network effects of collaboration. Here, we develop models that untangle the network effects of productivity defined as paper counts, and prominence referring to high-impact publications, of individual scientists from their collaboration networks. We find that gendered differences in the productivity and prominence of mid-career researchers can be largely explained by differences in their coauthorship networks. Hence, collaboration networks act as a form of social capital, and we find evidence of their transferability from senior to junior collaborators, with benefits that decay as researchers age. Collaboration network effects can also explain a large proportion of the productivity and prominence advantages held by researchers at prestigious institutions. These results highlight a substantial role of social networks in driving inequalities in science, and suggest that collaboration networks represent an important form of unequally distributed social capital that shapes who makes what scientific discoveries.

AB  - Double-blind peer review has been proposed as a possible solution to avoid implicit referee bias in academic publishing. The aims of this study are to analyse the demographics of corresponding authors choosing double-blind peer review and to identify differences in the editorial outcome of manuscripts depending on their review model.Data includes 128,454 manuscripts received between March 2015 and February 2017 by 25 Nature-branded journals. We investigated the uptake of double-blind review in relation to journal tier, as well as gender, country, and institutional prestige of the corresponding author. We then studied the manuscripts' editorial outcome in relation to review model and author's characteristics. The gender (male, female, or NA) of the corresponding authors was determined from their first name using a third-party service (Gender API). The prestige of the corresponding author's institutions was measured from the data of the Global Research Identifier Database (GRID) by dividing institutions in three prestige groups with reference to the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) ranking. We employed descriptive statistics for data exploration, and we tested our hypotheses using Pearson's chi-square and binomial tests. We also performed logistic regression modelling with author update, out-to-review, and acceptance as response, and journal tier, author gender, author country, and institution as predictors.Author uptake for double-blind submissions was 12% (12,631 out of 106,373). We found a small but significant association between journal tier and review type (p value < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.054, df = 2). We had gender information for 50,533 corresponding authors and found no statistically significant difference in the distribution of peer review model between males and females (p value = 0.6179). We had 58,920 records with normalised institutions and a THE rank, and we found that corresponding authors from the less prestigious institutions are more likely to choose double-blind review (p value < 0.001, df = 2, Cramer's V = 0.106). In the ten countries with the highest number of submissions, we found a large significant association between country and review type (p value < 0.001, df = 10, Cramer's V = 0.189). The outcome both at first decision and post review is significantly more negative (i.e. a higher likelihood for rejection) for double-blind than single-blind papers (p value < 0.001, df = 1, Cramer's V = 0.112 for first decision; p value < 0.001; df = 1, Cramer's V = 0.082 for post-review decision).The proportion of authors that choose double-blind review is higher when they submit to more prestigious journals, they are affiliated with less prestigious institutions, or they are from specific countries; the double-blind option is also linked to less successful editorial outcomes.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research project is to explore the impact of open access initiatives on biomedical research scientific publishing and scholarly communication in Greece. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents the preliminary findings from a longitudinal study that uses bibliometrics, questionnaire surveys and interviews to examine knowledge, awareness and attitudes towards open access. Findings Open access models vary considerably. The bibliometric research indicates that Greek biomedical publication is increasing, but that coverage of Greek medical journals in databases such as MEDLINE is decreasing. The picture is mixed with some evidence of open access journals (published in English) from Greek publishing bases. Awareness of open access among Greek biomedical scientists in date was comparatively low (58 per cent aware, n =70). Research limitations/implications Several Greek medical journals are published in English, and it is difficult to track the authorship for Greek researchers publishing in English language journals published elsewhere. Findings are preliminary as this is a longitudinal survey. Social implications Open access initiatives may privilege researchers from the English speaking world – or those in low income countries. Researchers from countries not in those categories may face unrecognised disadvantages in making their research visible. Originality/value This is the only study of Greek biomedical publishing, and comparisons are being made with similar studies of Spanish biomedical publishing.

AB  - &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; This paper aims to examine the availability of Open Access (OA) research literature in the field of digital library. In order to analyse the availability of OA research literature in the field of digital library, a search was conducted on Web of Science’s Core collection database on June 11, 2019. In response to a topic search TS = “Digital Library” using the advanced search option, 849 articles were retrieved. Of the 849 articles examined, the details of 26 articles were not found in the Google Scholar. Therefore, 823 articles were selected for further analyses. After examining the Websites of OA articles, they were classified into three categories: gold OA, green OA, and both gold and green OA. Furthermore, all the green OA articles were systematically organised into six groups for the examination of the self-archiving venues used by the researchers for self-archiving. Out of 823 articles analysed, OA versions were found for 64.76 per cent of articles. This study found that 26.68 per cent of OA articles were available through gold OA and 60.39 per cent articles were available through green OA, while 36.53 per cent articles were accessible via both OA journals and self-archiving (gold &amp; green OA). Although researchers used various OA platforms for self-archiving of their research work, publishers’ Websites were found as the most preferred choice for self-archiving of research work by the authors in the field of digital library. Computer Science discipline has the highest share of OA copies available through self-archiving. However, it is important to point out that more than 78 per cent of self-archived articles were found as the final publisher’s PDF versions of the article which publishers never allow for self-archiving.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;

AB  - Abstract Knowledge pertaining to scholarly publishing is not limited to information held within academic papers, and within a complex publishing environment that is in constant flux due to challenges and threats, there is interest in knowing how journals are adjusting to these parameters. The Internet Archive is a free and easy way to archive information that is found on websites. We recently argued for its use in the archival of website-based citations, and expand those arguments herein to focus on the importance to archive journal editorial boards, for three reasons: first, journals might not have any formal mechanisms to register changes in the editorial constitution of the board; second, there is historical importance in appreciating changes to editorial board constituency, including changes to gender representation; and third, changes might be made opaquely to hide or masquerade information that is intricately linked to the historical aspect of that journal. Our interest is thus not only within a historical prism, but also from a bibliometric point of view, given that the editorial board defines—to some extent—the journal’s content by serving as its gatekeepers of quality. We attempted to archive the editorial board pages of 46 journal editorial board URLs, achieving 100% mementos.

AB  - We analyzed how often and in what ways the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is currently used in review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) documents of a representative sample of universities from the United States and Canada. 40% of research-intensive institutions and 18% of master’s institutions mentioned the JIF, or closely related terms. Of the institutions that mentioned the JIF, 87% supported its use in at least one of their RPT documents, 13% expressed caution about its use, and none heavily criticized it or prohibited its use. Furthermore, 63% of institutions that mentioned the JIF associated the metric with quality, 40% with impact, importance, or significance, and 20% with prestige, reputation, or status. We conclude that use of the JIF is encouraged in RPT evaluations, especially at research-intensive universities, and that there is work to be done to avoid the potential misuse of metrics like the JIF.

AB  - Abstract This paper investigates different uses of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) in national journal rankings and discusses the merits of supplementing metrics with expert assessment. Our focus is national journal rankings used as evidence to support decisions about the distribution of institutional funding or career advancement. The seven countries under comparison are China, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Poland, and Turkey—and the region of Flanders in Belgium. With the exception of Italy, top‐tier journals used in national rankings include those classified at the highest level, or according to tier, or points implemented. A total of 3,565 (75.8%) out of 4,701 unique top‐tier journals were identified as having a JIF, with 55.7% belonging to the first Journal Impact Factor quartile. Journal rankings in China, Flanders, Poland, and Turkey classify journals with a JIF as being top‐tier, but only when they are in the first quartile of the Average Journal Impact Factor Percentile. Journal rankings that result from expert assessment in Denmark, Finland, and Norway regularly classify journals as top‐tier outside the first quartile, particularly in the social sciences and humanities. We conclude that experts, when tasked with metric‐informed journal rankings, take into account quality dimensions that are not covered by JIFs.

AB  - Abstract Open Access (OA) publishing has progressed from an initial fringe idea to a still‐growing, major component of modern academic communication. The proliferation of OA publishing presents a context to examine how new innovations and institutions develop. Based on analyses of 1,296,304 articles published in 83 OA journals, we analyze changes in the institutional status, gender, age, citedness, and geographical locations of authors over time. Generally, OA journals tended towards core‐to‐periphery diffusion patterns. Specifically, journal authors tended to decrease in high‐status institutional affiliations, male and highly cited authors over time. Despite these general tendencies, there was substantial variation in the diffusion patterns of OA journals. Some journals exhibited no significant demographic changes, and a few exhibited periphery‐to‐core diffusion patterns. We find that although both highly and less‐legitimate journals generally exhibit core‐to‐periphery diffusion patterns, there are still demographic differences between such journals. Institutional and cultural legitimacy—or lack thereof—affects the social and intellectual diffusion of new OA journals.

TI  - What about prestige in gold Open Access publishing – a survey investigating publication patterns of researchers at Swedish universities
IS  - 5
AU  - Lindelöw, Camilla
AB  - Fully gold Open Access (OA) publication channels are still hold to be of inferior quality compared to channels offered by publishers with traditional subscription business models, albeit less and less so. The threat of predatory publishers looms on one side, and on the other most OA publishers haven’t been around to gather prestige for so long. Still, there seems to be a steady advance. For example, OA publication channels may now be found at level two (indexing the channels perceived as having most academic prestige in a certain subject) of the Norwegian Publication Model (NPM).In an earlier survey, I investigated the publication patterns of researchers at Swedish universities with focus on their gold OA publishing in journals. The publication patterns were contrasted with the occurrence of OA journals in NPM. 29 % of the DOAJ journals were present as approved channels in NPM. DOAJ is frequently mentioned as the most comprehensive OA journal indexing service in the world. At level one, 14 % of the listed journals were OA, whereas only 2 % of level two journals were OA. Out of the DOAJ-journals included in NPM, only 1 % made it to level two. This is probably explained by the situation described above; OA journals are often new to the scientific publishing market, and therefore they haven’t had the time to gather academic prestige.The OA journals that researchers at Swedish universities published were almost all of them present in DOAJ. 7 % of these were at level two. This pattern seems to imply that researchers are trying to fulfil demands of OA publishing from funders, while at the same time trying to gather prestige for their own researcher career. This poster aims to further explore these results, with focus on the 7 % journals at level 2. Which journals can be found here, and what is the distribution? Which research subjects are involved?

TI  - What Are the Characteristics of Canadian Independent, Scholarly Journals? Results from a Website Analysis

VL  - 24

AB  - The dominance of commercial publishers (Larivière, Haustein, and Mongeon 2015) has led to a discussion in Canada focusing on alternative models for supporting independent, non-commercial, scholarly journals. Although small in number, these journals represent an important contribution to Canadian and global scholarship. They also act as a counterbalance to the increasingly for-profit nature of scholarly publishing. Despite their importance, there exists no definitive list of journals of this nature in Canada, making analysis and understanding of their characteristics difficult.In order to address this gap, the researchers undertook an analysis of the websites of 485 Canadian, independent, scholarly journals. Independent was defined as journals which are not affiliated with a commercial publisher. The researchers gathered data for each journal on their access type (e.g., closed, open access), subject area, size and composition of the editorial team, and any affiliation(s). This data was then analyzed to create a portrait of these journals with these themes. The researchers found that most of these journals were affiliated with at least one organization, with over half being associated with two or more. They also discovered that affiliations varied depending on the discipline and that the size of the editorial team was correlated to the access type. Journals were predominantly in the humanities and social sciences, and the majority were open access (OA) without article processing charges (APCs).While the focus of this study is on Canadian journals, this article provides a framework for other researchers to examine non-commercial, independent publishing in their own countries. Its results also provide preliminary data which may inspire future avenues of research, particularly into models for non-APC, open access journals as well as the editorial board structure and size for independent journals.

AB  - Key points Peer review, the cornerstone of academic publishing, has come under a lot of criticism for its flaws and has been manipulated by both authors and editors. Lack of review transparency is a contributing factor to peer review problems. Pressure to publish – among authors and journals – is adding to peer review problems. Technology can help maintain review integrity, although editorial vigilance remains key.

AB  - Key points Automated responsiveness is efficient and reassuring, but personalized responsiveness makes an author feel valued. On a very practical level, authors value timely peer review, perhaps above anything else. The perceived drop in copyediting and production quality is a common author gripe. Publishers need to be open about open access – many authors are not as knowledgeable as assumed.

IS  - 1

C1  - Loughborough University, UK
AB  - Traces the 12-year self-archiving policy journey of the original 107 publishers listed on the SHERPA/RoMEO Publisher Policy Database in 2004, through to 2015. Maps the RoMEO colour codes (‘green’, ‘blue’, ‘yellow’ and ‘white’) and related restrictions and conditions over time. Finds that while the volume of publishers allowing some form of self-archiving (pre-print, post-print or both) has increased by 12% over the 12 years, the volume of restrictions around how, where and when self-archiving may take place has increased 119%, 190% and 1000% respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the increase in self-archiving restrictions and the introduction of Gold paid open access options. Suggests that by conveying only the version of a paper that authors may self-archive, the RoMEO colour codes do not address all the key elements of the Bethesda Definition of Open Access. Compares the number of RoMEO ‘green’ publishers over time with those meeting the definition for ‘redefined green’ (allowing embargo-free deposit of the post-print in an institutional repository). Finds that RoMEO ‘green’ increased by 8% and ‘redefined green’ decreased by 35% over the 12 years. Concludes that the RoMEO colour codes no longer convey a commitment to green open access as originally intended. Calls for open access advocates, funders, institutions and authors to redefine what ‘green’ means to better reflect a publisher’s commitment to self-archiving.

AB  - In recent years, increased stakeholder pressure to transition research to Open Access has led to many journals converting, or 'flipping', from a closed access (CA) to an open access (OA) publishing model. Changing the publishing model can influence the decision of authors to submit their papers to a journal, and increased article accessibility may influence citation behaviour. In this paper we aimed to understand how flipping a journal to an OA model influences the journal's future publication volumes and citation impact. We analysed two independent sets of journals that had flipped to an OA model, one from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and one from the Open Access Directory (OAD), and compared their development with two respective control groups of similar journals. For bibliometric analyses, journals were matched to the Scopus database. We assessed changes in the number of articles published over time, as well as two citation metrics at the journal and article level: the normalised impact factor (IF) and the average relative citations (ARC), respectively. Our results show that overall, journals that flipped to an OA model increased their publication output compared to journals that remained closed. Mean normalised IF and ARC also generally increased following the flip to an OA model, at a greater rate than was observed in the control groups. However, the changes appear to vary largely by scientific discipline. Overall, these results indicate that flipping to an OA publishing model can bring positive changes to a journal.

AB  - This article represents the study of Ukrainian legislative documents in order to define, how they promote scientific quality, performance and excellence.The research management problem is defined as a limitation to use direct research and knowledge management and a reason for implementation of indirect criteria.The study shows that aims, principles and requirements on scientific quality, excellence and performance as motivated proposals mainly absent in Ukrainian legislation and they have no systemic context for realization.It is noted, that an operative use of scientific degrees and academic titles as criteria of scientific quality leads to the weakness of policy, because they mainly represent the social status and qualification.Another weaken position in legislation is an absence of requirements for research assessment of individual scientists in order to stimulate research excellence and competition between them.The main result is that socioeconomic transformations may damage the unity of research policy, legislation and management and change the values of cognitive and creative activities.

AB  - This article is a first-hand account of the author's work identifying and listing predatory publishers from 2012 to 2017. Predatory publishers use the gold (author pays) open access model and aim to generate as much revenue as possible, often foregoing a proper peer review. The paper details how predatory publishers came to exist and shows how they were largely enabled and condoned by the open-access social movement, the scholarly publishing industry, and academic librarians. The author describes tactics predatory publishers used to attempt to be removed from his lists, details the damage predatory journals cause to science, and comments on the future of scholarly publishing.

AB  - There is a broad difference of opinion among the many stakeholders in scholarly publishing about how to precisely define open access publishing. Are “open access” and “open data” what we mean by open? Does “open” mean anything else? Does it mean “to make available,” or “to make freely available in a particular format?” Is a clearer definition needed (or maybe just better education on the current definition)? Why or why not? At present, some stakeholders see public access as being an acceptable stopping point in the move toward open access. Others see “open” as requiring free and immediate access with articles being available in CC-BY format. The range of opinions between these extremes is vast. How should these differences be decided? Who should decide? Is it possible to make binding recommendations (and how)? Is consensus necessary? What are the consequences of the lack of consensus?

AB  - Academics and librarians around the world are raising concern about the current state of scholarly journal publishing in that the majority of journals are under the control of five multinational commercial journal publishing companies. Some are advocating for scholars to take back control of scholarly communication, particularly because it is the academics who are supplying and managing most of the content for journals. Open access publishing is one option, but the question of sustainability in funding streams raises concerns. Also the roles of scholarly societies, academic association, and universities in looking for stability in nonprofit journal publishing are discussed.

AB  - This paper aims to address the issue of predatory publishing, sensu lato. To achieve this, we offer our perspectives, starting initially with some background surrounding the birth of the concept, even though the phenomenon may have already existed long before the popularization of the term "predatory publishing". The issue of predation or "predatory" behavior in academic publishing is no longer limited to open access (OA). Many of the mainstream publishers that were exclusively subscription-based are now evolving towards a state of complete OA. Academics seeking reliable sources of journals to publish their work tend to rely on a journal's metrics such as citations and indexing, and on whether it is blacklisted or whitelisted. Jeffrey Beall raised awareness of the risks of "predatory" OA publishing, and his blacklists of "predatory" OA journals and publishers began to be used for official purposes to distinguish valid from perceived invalid publishing venues. We initially reflect on why we believe the blacklists created by Beall were flawed, primarily due to the weak set of criteria confusing non-predatory with true predatory journals leading to false positives and missing out on blacklisting true predatory journals due to false negatives. Historically, most critiques of "predatory publishing" have relied excessively on Beall's blacklists to base their assumptions and conclusions but there is a need to look beyond these. There are currently a number of blacklists and whitelists circulating in academia, but they all have imperfections, such as the resurrected Beall blacklists, Crawford's OA gray list based on Beall's lists, Cabell's new blacklist with about 11,000 journals, the DOAJ with about 11,700 OA journals, and UGC, with over 32,600 journals prior to its recent (May 2018) purge of 4305 journals. The reader is led into a discussion about blacklists' lack of reliability, using the scientific framework of conducting research to assess whether a journal could be predatory at the pre- and post-study levels. We close our discussion by offering arguments why we believe blacklists are academically invalid.

AB  - In theory, articles can attract readers on the social reference sharing site M endeley before they can attract citations, so M endeley altmetrics could provide early indications of article impact. This article investigates the influence of time on the number of M endeley readers of an article through a theoretical discussion and an investigation into the relationship between counts of readers of, and citations to, 4 general library and information science ( LIS ) journals. For this discipline, it takes about 7 years for articles to attract as many S copus citations as M endeley readers, and after this the S pearman correlation between readers and citers is stable at about 0.6 for all years. This suggests that M endeley readership counts may be useful impact indicators for both newer and older articles. The lack of dates for individual M endeley article readers and an unknown bias toward more recent articles mean that readership data should be normalized individually by year, however, before making any comparisons between articles published in different years.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to report the findings of a study of publishing behaviour among a group of Arab scholars in social science and humanities disciplines. The paper also investigated the number of Arab scholars who are publishing in predatory journals and the reasons that drive them to select these journals to share their scholarly findings. The study adopted a mixed methods approach. Eighteen journals that were categorized as predatory journals were scanned to find the number of Arab scholars who published in them. Then, a questionnaire was sent to Egyptian and Saudi scholars as they were found to be the top Arab contributors in these journals. The questionnaire was followed by semi‐structured interviews to gain an in‐depth understanding of the publishing behaviour. The data showed that many Arab scholars prefer publishing in predatory journals as these journals are easier and faster. The results also indicate that there is a need to raise the awareness of the harm that predatory journals can cause to the scholars and how they can avoid these journals. This study was conducted with social science and humanities scholars in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The publishing behaviour may differ in other scholarly disciplines and other Arabic countries.

AB  - The paper intends to help scientific authors to make the best choice of journals in which to publish, by describing and comparing journal features in the area of oncology. For this purpose, the authors identified impact factor (IF) ranking, cost options and copyright conditions offered to authors wishing to publish in full open access (OA), subscription-based or hybrid journals.Data referring to articles published in 2010 by three Italian research institutions (National Institute of Health - Rome (ISS), Regina Elena National Cancer Institute - Rome (IRE), National Cancer Institute - Milan (INT) in journals (78) managed according to different business models, all listed in the Journal Citation Reports, subject category Oncology, were collected and analysed. The journals surveyed were ranked according to IF, position in quartiles, publication charges, usage rights in published articles, self-archiving conditions in OAI-compliant repositories digital archives.Almost half (34) the journals surveyed were included in the first quartile, thus revealing authors' preference for journals with a high IF. The prevalent journal business model was the hybrid formula (based on subscriptions but also offering a paid OA option) with 51 journals, followed by subscription-based only journals accounting for 22, while just 5 full OA journals were identified. In general, no relationship was found between IF and article publication charges, in terms of correspondence between more expensive fees and higher IF.The issue of OA journals as compared with traditional subscription-based journals is highly debated among stakeholders: library administrators facing financial restrictions, authors seeking to locate the best outlet for their research, publishers wishing to increase their revenues by offering journals with wider appeal. Against this background, factors such as the quest for alternatives to high-cost business models, investments in setting up institutional repositories hosting the published versions of articles and efforts to overcome copyright barriers and gain free access to scientific literature are all crucial.

AB  - Purpose How to obtain a list of the 100 largest scientific publishers sorted by journal count? Existing databases are unhelpful as each of them inhere biased omissions and data quality flaws. This paper tries to fill this gap with an alternative approach. Design/methodology/approach The content coverages of Scopus, Publons, DOAJ and SherpaRomeo were first used to extract a preliminary list of publishers that supposedly possess at least 15 journals. Second, the publishers' websites were scraped to fetch their portfolios and, thus, their “true” journal counts. Findings The outcome is a list of the 100 largest publishers comprising 28.060 scholarly journals, with the largest publishing 3.763 journals, and the smallest carrying 76 titles. The usual “oligopoly” of major publishing companies leads the list, but it also contains 17 university presses from the Global South, and, surprisingly, 30 predatory publishers that together publish 4.517 journals. Research limitations/implications Additional data sources could be used to mitigate remaining biases; it is difficult to disambiguate publisher names and their imprints; and the dataset carries a non-uniform distribution, thus risking the omission of data points in the lower range. Practical implications The dataset can serve as a useful basis for comprehensive meta-scientific surveys on the publisher-level. Originality/value The catalogue can be deemed more inclusive and diverse than other ones because many of the publishers would have been overlooked if one had drawn from merely one or two sources. The list is freely accessible and invites regular updates. The approach used here (webscraping) has seldomly been used in meta-scientific surveys.

AB  - Abstract In this paper we study the diversity of users of open access articles on the Finnish Journal.fi platform. This platform hosts around hundred open access journals from Finland publishing in different fields and mainly Finnish and English languages. The study is based on an online survey, conducted on 48 journals during Spring 2020, in which visitors were asked to indicate their background and allow their location and download behaviour be tracked. Among 668 survey participants, the two largest groups were students (40%) and researchers (36%), followed by private citizens (8%), other experts (7%) and teachers (5%). Other identified user categories include journalists, civil servants, entrepreneurs and politicians. While new publications attract a considerable share of the views, there is still a relatively large interest, especially among students, in older materials. Our findings indicate that Finnish language publications are particularly important for reaching students, citizens, experts and politicians. Thus, open access to publications in national languages is vital for the local relevance and outreach of research.

AB  - Many open access journals have a reputation for being of low quality and being dishonest with regard to peer review and publishing costs. Such journals are labeled “predatory” journals. This study examines author profiles for some of these “predatory” journals as well as for groups of more well‐recognized open access journals. We collect and analyze the publication record, citation count, and geographic location of authors from the various groups of journals. Statistical analyses verify that each group of journals has a distinct author population. Those who publish in “predatory” journals are, for the most part, young and inexperienced researchers from developing countries. We believe that economic and sociocultural conditions in these developing countries have contributed to the differences found in authorship between “predatory” and “nonpredatory” journals.

AB  - You have probably heard about them: the <em>Directory of Open Access Journals</em> (DOAJ), <em>Directory of Open Access Repositories</em> (OpenDOAR) and now, <em>Directory of Open Access Books</em> (DOAB). The abbreviations pop up on familiar list-discussions and blogs. The services are mentioned at conferences, referred to in articles about scholarly publishing, and their data is used in research about open access (OA). You might ask yourself what all this fuss is about? Are these directories contributing to scholarly communication? If so, how exactly? This article argues for the value of the directories, mainly focusing on two of them: DOAJ and DOAB. It provides an introduction to the services, containing a brief history and status report, and addresses the differences between OA journal publishing and OA monograph publishing. It also highlights the value of these services and discusses whether the financial models behind them are sustainable.

AB  - Books are relevant outputs in research in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and need to be considered properly in research evaluation. Books are different from journals and the scholarly book publishing sector remains quite unknown within evaluation agencies. This paper describes the state of the scholarly publishing sector, beyond the large publishing groups and imprints, focusing the attention to the role of small- and medium-sized scholarly publishers at the national level. Bibliodiversity and multilingualism are essential values for representing plural and diverse SSH research. They are also linked to societal impact. Academic Book Publishers project and Helsinki Initiative are described to this regard. Finally, some remarks and recommendations for addressing the assessment of books are provided.Policy HighlightsSince monographs and edited books are essential communication media in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), they should be considered properly in research evaluation processes. Books are not outputs of second level in SSH research.Books are different from journals, which means that specific knowledge on the book publishing ecosystem and editorial practices is needed for addressing their evaluation. In this sense, it is important:Establishing stronger connections between the associations of scholarly publishers and research evaluation agencies.Boosting research on national academic book publishing landscapes.SSH research may be locally oriented and therefore published in national languages through national journals and publishers. Academic books should be evaluated considering this relevant feature of SSH research. It entails:Using complete publication data sources that reflect the diversity of scholarly publishers contributing to the dissemination of high quality research in SSH.Acknowledging the role of the small- and medium-sized, professional scholarly publishers which in each country take care of the publication of rigorous scholarly contents, closer related to local topics and written in national languages. Their role is complementary to that of the large imprints and publishing groups.Giving an adequate value to channels that allow for generating societal impact, especially to scholarly books (by local, regional and national publishers).Indicators can be used properly only if they take into account the diversity of scholarly publishers and the characteristics of the publishing landscape.

AB  - PLoS ONE is five years old this month. Though still young in age, the journal has grown up remarkably rapidly, to the extent that it is now the largest peer-reviewed journal in the world. In the past five years, it has both garnered huge respect and support from authors, readers, and editors, and drawn the criticism and ire of many commercial publishers and establishment figures still fighting to maintain the science publishing status quo. Their fight now appears to be in vain, however: this past year a series of journals emerged that are very similar in scope to PLoS ONE (Table 1), suggesting that the landscape of scholarly publishing has irreversibly shifted. PLoS ONE clearly fills an unmet need in the world of scientific publishing, or publishers and scholarly societies wouldn't want to copy it.Table 1A sample of recently launched journals similar in scope to PLoS ONE.The success of PLoS ONE has surprised even us. The journal is now publishing about 70 papers a day (i.e., currently around 4,000 papers every quarter), and this figure continues to grow (Figure 1). If the trend continues, it will publish 14,500 articles in 2011: approximately 1 in 60 of all the papers indexed by PubMed in that calendar year will have been published in PLoS ONE. It has even attracted a new term—“megajournal”—to characterize it and the other journals of its ilk [1].Figure 1Publication growth of PLoS ONE.We believe its success relies on two features: trust and innovation. By demonstrating that open access (OA) is compatible with high quality and rigorous science, PLoS Biology, then PLoS Medicine and the PLoS “Community Journals” (PLoS Genetics, PLoS Computational Biology, PLoS Pathogens, and PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases) built a “PLoS brand,” making PLoS a trusted source of excellent science that authors and readers respect. As a result, PLoS could introduce a single key innovation beyond that of OA—one that represented a fundamental change to the traditional editorial model (and which has garnered awards from the Association of Learned and Professional Publishers [2] and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition [3]). All articles in PLoS ONE are peer reviewed, but editors and reviewers are explicitly asked not to assess the “broad interest” or importance of a paper, a criterion that provides the rationale for other journals to reject articles. Instead, any article can be published if it is technically sound, ethically and appropriately reported, and its conclusions are supported by the data. Thus, PLoS ONE publications include negative results, methods papers, and studies that replicate (but do not duplicate) others, as well as articles that potentially represent a major advance for the field. And because PLoS ONE covers all of science (albeit with a current focus on the life and medical sciences), and because the publication fee ensures that each article covers its own editorial and production costs, there is no limit to PLoS ONE's potential size beyond that of science itself [4].

AB  - When the Academic Council at Duke University adopted an open access policy in March 2010, they both enacted a legal mechanism for archiving scholarship in Duke's institutional repository and expressed a set of values in regard to access to research. From the legal perspective, the policy grants to the University a license to archive all peer-reviewed scholarly articles in the DukeSpace repository, which is managed by the University Libraries. That license is broad, but there were clear limitations on its implementation expressed by the Academic Council. From the point of view of values, this policy is a clear statement that research is undertaken for the benefit of society as a whole, and that improving access to the products of that research is beneficial to the researchers themselves, to the University and to the global community. This article explores the path Duke followed to develop and implement such a policy.

AB  - Choosing a scientific journal for publication of research article or review paper is a universal problem faced by all scientists and PhD students after finishing his/her scientific research. Generally, the authors of pharmaceutical and medical journals are neither paid nor do they expect any financial recompense for their publication. What then is the motivating power behind researcher’s enthusiasm to publish their paper? It is possibly, the pleasure and gratification of being an element of the progression of pharmaceutical sciences and medicine through research and successive publication.Nevertheless, the true worth of a research deception is in its citation by other scientists after publication. Thus, the paper should be read by as several researchers as possible. The aim of this editorial paper is to talk about the significant reasons that the scientist and author should consider and judge while choosing International Journal of Pharmacology, Phytochemistry and Ethnomedicine (IJPPE) for submission and publication, so as to improve and increase the probability of acceptance to add value to their research and study, and most of all guarantee an extensive distribution and readership. Then why not submit and publish your best scientific articles in IJPPE and add value to your research and paper.

Because of the existing highly competitive journal publishing environment, I present a few measures that could be undertaken to allow multilingual peripheral researchers to increase their influence as global partners in the world of science.
