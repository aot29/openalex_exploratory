AB  - The Web is revolutionizing the entire scholarly communication process and changing the way that researchers exchange information. In this paper, we analyze two views of information production and use in computer-related research based on citation analysis of PDF and Postcript formatted publications on the Web using autonomous citation indexing (ACI), and a parallel citation analysis of the journal literature indexed by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in SCISEARCH. Our goal is to establish a baseline profile of computer science "literature" as it appears in the published journals and as it appears on the publicly available Web. From this starting point, we hope to identify additional research areas dealing with information dissemination and citation practices in computer science and the utility of autonomous citation indexing on the Web as an adjunct to commercial indexing

AB  - Scholarly publishing serves the formal communication needs of scholars or researchers and derives from, and is constructed to reflect, their aspirations and behaviour. Specifically, journal publishing was invented by Oldenburg in 1665 to solve some of the competitive jealousies that existed between the experimentalist founding fathers of the Royal Society. The solutions he came up with have endured to the present day and have even survived the transition to electronic delivery. This article surveys the reasons why this should be so and examines the modern world of electronic journal publishing with particular reference to the players in the publishing cycle, the digital transition, economics and the advent of open access.

AB  - The presence of the Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 has inevitably affected the way how scholars proceed to write. Thus, activities intended to yield a piece of scientific writing facilitated by the obtainability and accessibility of internet browsing is called scholarly publishing. Since English has indisputably become the language of international scholarship and research, it is urgent to have the skill in writing scientific articles benefitting the support from IR 4.0 principles. What is going on with academics and what should they do dealing with the IR 4.0 pertinent to their scholarly writing activities, benefits, and drawbacks. This paper discusses what scholarly publishing in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and how it supports the process of writing articles for publishing. The purposes of this paper are to explain (1). What are scholarly publishing and industrial revolution? (2). Why is it essential for academics? (3) How does writing scholarly publication in Industrial Revolution 4.0 work? Writing the scholarly publication in English has become obligatory for Teacher-Educator Authors (TEAs) and undergraduate students to doctoral students in Indonesia. The study was a descriptive qualitative library to build a conceptual paper for the purpose of a further study. The method was by reviewing any related kinds of literature to provide sufficient arguments for the three research questions. The outcome is several claims, arguments, and evidence gambits for any author to consider. Theoretically, the IR 4.0 principles have significantly eased the flexibility of the process, the quality, and the credibility of research outputs.

AB  - Spam has become an issue of concern in almost all areas where the Internet is involved, and many people today have become victims of spam from publishers and individual journals. We studied this phenomenon in the field of scholarly publishing from the perspective of a single author. We examined 1,024 such spam e‐mails received by M arcin K ozak from publishers and journals over a period of 391 days, asking him to submit an article to their journal. We collected the following information: where the request came from; publishing model applied; fees charged; inclusion or not in the D irectory of O pen A ccess J ournals ( DOAJ ); and presence or not in Beall's (2014) listing of dubious journals. Our research showed that most of the publishers that sent e‐mails inviting manuscripts were (i) using the open access model, (ii) using article‐processing charges to fund their journal's operations; (iii) offering very short peer‐review times, (iv) on B eall's list, and (v) misrepresenting the location of their headquarters. Some years ago, a letter of invitation to submit an article to a particular journal was considered a kind of distinction. Today, e‐mails inviting submissions are generally spam, something that misleads young researchers and irritates experienced ones.

AB  - Many librarians and scholars believe that the Internet can be used to dramatically improve scholarly communication. During the last decade there has been substantial discussion of five major publishing models where readers could access articles without a fee: electronic journals, hybrid paper-electronic journals, authors' self-posting on web sites, free online access to all peer reviewed literature, and disciplinary repositories where authors post their own unrefereed articles. There have been numerous projects within each of these models, as well as extensive discussions about their strengths and limitations. While some of these projects have become important scholarly resources in specific disciplines; none of them has become commonplace across numerous disciplines. There is a sixth model that has been quietly adopted and developed in a number of disciplines – the research publication series called working papers or technical reports that are sponsored by academic departments or research institutes. Many of these manuscript series are available to readers, online, and free of charge. This model – which we call Guild Publishing – has a distinct set of advantages and limitations when compared with the other five publishing models. This article explains the Guild Publishing Model, provides some examples, and discusses its strengths and limitations.

AB  - ABSTRACT The paper presents the results of an international questionnaire survey of the attitudes of senior authors towards scholarly publishing. It was commissioned by the Publishers Association (PA) and the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM). A total of 5,513 authors participated. The questionnaire included 22 closed questions and one open‐ended question that 1,943 authors used to freely express their views. Using QSR N6 textual analysis software, their comments were processed and themes extracted. The main concerns of the authors were the peer‐review process, faster publishing, better access to journals, journal prices, and issues related to electronic publishing.

AB  - The World Wide Web is opening up access to documents and data for scholars. However it has not yet impacted on one of the primary activities in research: assessing new findings in the light of current knowledge and debating it with colleagues. The ClaiMaker system uses a directed graph model with similarities to hypertext, in which new ideas are published as nodes, which other contributors can build on or challenge in a variety of ways by linking to them. Nodes and links have semantic structure to facilitate the provision of specialist services for interrogating and visualizing the emerging network. By way of example, this paper is grounded in a ClaiMaker model to illustrate how new claims can be described in this structured way.

We report on each of the tasks, which received 18 submissions in total, with some submissions addressing two or three of the tasks. In summary, the quality and quantity of the submissions show that there is ample interest in scholarly document summarization, and the state of the art in this domain is at a midway point between being an impossible task and one that is fully resolved.

AB  - Scholarly publishing is on the verge of a drastic change from print journals to electronic ones. Although this change has been predicted for a long time, trends in technology and growth in the literature are making this transition inevitable. It is likely to occur in a few years, and is likely to be sudden. This article surveys the pressures that are leading to the impending change, and makes predictions about the future of journals, publishers, and libraries. The new electronic publishing methods are likely to improve greatly scholarly communication, partially through more rapid publication, but also through wider dissemination and a variety of novel features that cannot be implemented with the present print system, such as references in a paper to later papers that cite it.

AB  - the Directory of Open Access Journals, the Committee on Publication Ethics, and the World Association of Medical Editors declared the third version of "Principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly publishing" to ensure transparency and quality in journal publications.This study is aimed at assessing the guidelines from the journals' websites manually.Methods: In this study, three researchers investigate the homepages of 781 academic society-published journals that are registered in the Science Citation Index Expanded and whether these journals are effectively adopting these new guidelines.In this paper, 33 items from the guidelines are examined.The 33 items are rearranged into four different categories: basic journal information; publication ethics; copyright and archiving information; and profit model.The researchers count yes or no after checking the adopting status on the journal homepage and dividing into four scales: 0% to 25% for is rarely practiced, 26% to 50% for is poorly practiced, 51% to 75% for is adequately practiced, and 76% to 100% for is well practiced.Results: Of the 33 items, 10 are found to be poorly or rarely practiced, including readership, data sharing, archiving policies, and profit model information. Conclusion:It could be the most up-to-date indicator of the current status of applying best practice guidelines.Society journal editors especially from Asia should evaluate their journals regarding "Principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly publishing".

AB  - Library-based publishing efforts are gaining traction in academic and research libraries across the world, primarily in response to perceived gaps in the scholarly publishing system. Though publishing is a new area of work for libraries, it is often a natural outgrowth of their existing infrastructure and skill sets, leveraging the institutional repository as publishing platform and repositioning librarians’ skills as information managers. For decades, these initiatives were primarily ad hoc and local, limiting the potential for library publishing to effect significant change. In 2013, over 60 academic and research libraries collectively founded the Library Publishing Coalition (LPC), a professional association expressly charged with facilitating knowledge sharing, collaboration and advocacy for this growing field. This article offers an overview of library publishing activity, primarily in the US, followed by an account of the creation and mission of the LPC, the first professional association dedicated wholly to the support of library publishers.

AB  - Key points Plain language summaries (PLS) are accessible, short, peer‐reviewed summaries of scholarly journal articles written in non‐technical language. The aim of PLS is to enable a broader audience of experts and non‐experts to understand the original article. Here, we outline the evidence base for the value and impact of PLS and how they can enable diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility in scholarly publishing. PLS can diversify readership and authorship, address information inequity, include typically under‐represented stakeholders and provide an accessible route into scholarly literature.

AB  - As we move discussions around publishing forward and adopt open-access models, social scientists need to consider how digital infrastructure opens and closes possibilities for scholarly production and engagement. Attention to changes in publishing infrastructure—which, like most infrastructure, is often rendered invisible—is needed, not only because it allows us to make sense of socio-technical transitions at various scales and for differently invested communities, but because we need more informed participants, users who can question the system in ways that make it more robust. This essay suggests that digital infrastructure design and development should be organized around (1) platform affordances, (2) support for labor, (3) emerging circulation practices, and (4) opportunities for collaboration. By tracing the long-term socio-technical work that made it possible for Cultural Anthropology to go open access earlier this year, this essay works to make visible some behind-the-scenes details to be considered when thinking about the future of scholarly publishing.

AB  - To address the complexities researchers face during publication, and the potential community-wide benefits of wider adoption of clear data policies, the publisher Springer Nature has developed a standardised, common framework for the research data policies of all its journals. An expert working group was convened to audit and identify common features of research data policies of the journals published by Springer Nature, where policies were present. The group then consulted with approximately 30 editors, covering all research disciplines within the organisation. The group also consulted with academic editors, librarians and funders, which informed development of the framework and the creation of supporting resources. Four types of data policy were defined in recognition that some journals and research communities are more ready than others to adopt strong data policies. As of January 2017 more than 700 journals have adopted a standard policy and this number is growing weekly. To potentially enable standardisation and harmonisation of data policy across funders, institutions, repositories, societies and other publishers, the policy framework was made available under a Creative Commons license. However, the framework requires wider debate with these stakeholders and an Interest Group within the Research Data Alliance (RDA) has been formed to initiate this process.

AB  - Scholarly publishing, and scholarly communication more generally, are based on patterns established over many decades and even centuries. Some of these patterns are clearly valuable and intimately related to core values of the academy, but others were based on the exigencies of the past, and new opportunities have brought into question whether it makes sense to persist in supporting old models. New technologies and new publishing models raise the question of how we should fund and operate scholarly publishing and scholarly communication in the future, moving away from a scarcity model based on the exchange of physical goods that restricts access to scholarly literature unless a market-based exchange takes place. This essay describes emerging models that attempt to shift scholarly communication to a more open-access and mission-based approach and that try to retain control of scholarship by academics and the institutions and scholarly societies that support them. It explores changing practices for funding scholarly journals and changing services provided by academic libraries, changes instituted with the end goal of providing more access to more readers, stimulating new scholarship, and removing inefficiencies from a system ready for change.

AB  - Scholarly publishing is undergoing a transformation that affects every participant in the information chain. Serials used to be a relatively uncomplicated activity, driven by the need of scholars and researchers to publish. Since the early 1980s, both journal price inflation and the growth in the number of journals and the numbers of papers published have outstripped the ability of even the most lavishly funded library to purchase what faculty and students demand. At the same time, modern technology has offered us the opportunity to develop new ways of distributing scholarly literature that offer the researcher facilities and qualities that cannot be undertaken in the print medium

AB  - Argument mining targets structures in natural language related to interpretation and persuasion which are central to scientific communication. Most scholarly discourse involves interpreting experimental evidence and attempting to persuade other scientists to adopt the same conclusions. While various argument mining studies have addressed student essays and news articles, those that target scientific discourse are still scarce. This paper surveys existing work in argument mining of scholarly discourse, and provides an overview of current models, data, tasks, and applications. We identify a number of key challenges confronting argument mining in the scientific domain, and suggest some possible solutions and future directions.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article sets the scene for the special issue on research data and publishing. Research data – that material commonly accepted by the scholarly community as required evidence for hypotheses and insights, for verification and/or reproducibility of experiments – has become an increasingly critical issue for publishers given recent developments in funders' mandates, technological advances, policymakers' interests, and so forth. I outline some of the recent initiatives that are responding to policy directives, particularly Project ODE, and consider how publishers are working with data and integrating their practices with other collaborative efforts. A summary of the new policies, products, and partnerships demonstrates that the onus is now with scholarly publishers to gain an understanding of these developments and how they are affecting fellow key stakeholders within the research communications ecosystem.

AB  - Purpose: The “Principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly publishing” are of increasing importance in an open science environment as a way to increase the transparency and quality of academic society journals. However, little previous research has investigated the application of this new guideline in practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the degree to which this guideline is being applied by Korean academic society– published journals listed in Journal Citation Reports.Methods: The researchers investigated the homepages of 59 Korean academic society– published journals to evaluate whether they had adopted the 33 items listed in the guideline. Based on the information available on the journals’ homepages, each item was classified as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ within the four categories of basic journal information, publication ethics, copyright and archiving information, and profit model.Results: The basic journal information category was generally well-practiced, with the exceptions of the peer review process, readership, and author fees. The copyright and licensing information category was also well-practiced, with the exception of policies on posting accepted articles with third parties and archiving items. However, most items in the publication ethics category were not well practiced, with the exception of authorship and intellectual property. All items in the profit model category were infrequently implemented.Conclusion: These findings serve as a good indicator for Korean journal editors of areas for improvement. It may be helpful to review journals’ publication policies and homepages to comply with international publishing standards.

Support and services offered vary depending on available resources as well as the robustness of a library’s publishing program. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM This article describes the connection between publishing services and scholarly publishing literacy through examples from the University of South Florida (USF) Libraries. The USF Libraries’ OA publishing program includes journals, textbooks, conference proceedings, and more. Our program balances advocating for open access with advising for actions that serve our partners’ goals. This invites trust, sustainable relationships, and opportunities for new work. NEXT STEPS At the USF Libraries, more work must be done to formally assess our efforts. Our program will also explore new ways to support the ethical standards expected of libraries by pursuing stronger policies on diversity and inclusion. Using everyday work to demonstrate best practices is a manageable way to strengthen scholarly publishing efforts. We hope to continue growing our services, empowering our partners, and exploring our roles as advisors and advocates.

AB  - ABSTRACT The transition from traditional, paper‐based publishing to electronic publishing presents many challenges for publishers and their constituents. Among the most significant are those that concern linking to articles that are available online and citing of articles that are now published online prior to (or even in lieu of) the final pagination and binding of paper issues. The solutions to these problems will have a great impact on the usability of the scholarly electronic corpus for the research community. In particular, the solutions must be easy to use, persistent, and scalable. Here we examine some pragmatic solutions (in use now) that satisfy these criteria and contrast them with other proposed solutions. The examples are drawn mainly from the experiences of the American Physical Society, but the lessons gleaned will have wide applicability.

AB  - Abstract Many librarians and scholars believe that the Internet can be used to dramatically improve scholarly communication. During the last decade there has been substantial discussion of five major publishing models where readers could access articles without a fee: electronic journals, hybrid paper‐electronic journals, authors' self‐posting on web sites, free online access to all peer reviewed literature, and disciplinary repositories where authors post their own unrefereed articles. There have been numerous projects within each of these models, as well as extensive discussions about their strengths and limitations. While some of these projects have become important scholarly resources in specific disciplines; none of them has become commonplace across numerous disciplines. There is a sixth model that has been quietly adopted and developed in a number of disciplines – the research publication series called working papers or technical reports that are sponsored by academic departments or research institutes. Many of these manuscript series are available to readers, online, and free of charge. This model – which we call Guild Publishing – has a distinct set of advantages and limitations when compared with the other five publishing models. This article explains the Guild Publishing Model, provides some examples, and discusses its strengths and limitations.

AB  - The reason is the article processing charge (APC), which typically runs $3,000 to $5,000.The APC model, with its tolled access to authorship, is the subscription model seen through a camera obscura: author paywalls in place of reading paywalls.Most scholars cannot afford the steep fees, a fact masked by the privileged segment who can: scientists in the rich industrialized world, and scholars in a handful of wealthy European countries and North American universities.The fees are often paid via so-called "read-and-publish" deals, which fold APCs into the subscription contracts

AB  - Charles W. Bailey Jr. is well known in librarian circles for his compilations and commentary on open access publishing, digital copyright, and repositories for digitized scholarship and collections, among other areas of interest. Bailey has been a frequent contributor to various library and scholarly email discussion lists with links to his digital bibliographies and brief introductions. In 2005, he founded Digital Scholarship with the purpose of publishing and distributing his work in both paper and digital formats, as well as a related blog, DigitalKoans. Perhaps his most well-known bibliography, the Scholarly Electronic Publishing Bibliography, has been updated more than seventy-five times and now appears in an annual print edition as well as the electronic format, according to the appendix “About the Author.”Transforming Scholarly Publishing Through Open Access is another in a growing list of Bailey's self-published works. The paperback edition is sold for $15.95, and it is available free in open-access digital format through www.digital-scholarship.org.Bibliographers perform a critical role by compiling and bringing order to the world of knowledge, with careful consideration for what is most important and seminal in a subject. Bailey is a master of compiling lists of articles, web pages, white papers, and books on a particular topic and distributing them to a wide audience. However, Bailey does little to help readers understand his selection criteria and his understanding of the significance of these citations. This bibliography, like the others, is extensive and well organized with topical subheadings. A preface helps readers understand what “open access” means and what models are available.The publication is divided into twelve parts. “Section 1: General Works” gives a list of publications discussing overviews, critiques, and debates, as well as economic issues. Nearly all sections also contain a list of research studies related to the section theme. Section 2 contains citations discussing copyright. Section 3 includes discussions of open access journals, including PubMed Central, Public Library of Science (PLoS), and others. Section 4 deals with electronic prints, while section 5 features disciplinary archives. Institutional repositories are the focus area of section 6, and it is the most extensive section. Section 7 includes the open archives initiative, and section 8 is titled, “Library Issues.” A list of publications addressing traditional publisher perspectives is in section 10, and section 11 lists publications discussing open access in emerging economies. Finally, section 12 is for Google Books, a subject that just became a bibliography in itself at the time of this writing.Much can be learned by reviewing the citations alone, but this can be done conveniently online without purchasing a print copy. Readers of the print version will want to locate the digital version anyway for the convenience of accessing the links to web-based articles. The publication's value would be greatly increased with annotations to selected citations and written overviews of each section. Highlighting what he considers the “most important” and discussing selection criteria would also be helpful and of interest to the reader. This bibliography is recommended for everyone interested in open access publishing.

AB  - The emergence of the Internet has triggered tremendous changes in the publication of scientific peer-reviewed journals. Today, journals are usually available in parallel electronic versions, but the way the peer-review process works, the look of articles and journals, and the rigid and slow publication schedules have remained largely unchanged, at least for the vast majority of subscription-based journals. Those publishing firms and scholarly publishers who have chosen the more radical option of open access (OA), in which the content of journals is freely accessible to anybody with Internet connectivity, have had a much bigger degree of freedom to experiment with innovations.The objective was to study how open access journals have experimented with innovations concerning ways of organizing the peer review, the format of journals and articles, new interactive and media formats, and novel publishing revenue models.The features of 24 open access journals were studied. The journals were chosen in a nonrandom manner from the approximately 7000 existing OA journals based on available information about interesting journals and include both representative cases and highly innovative outlier cases.Most early OA journals in the 1990s were founded by individual scholars and used a business model based on voluntary work close in spirit to open-source development of software. In the next wave, many long-established journals, in particular society journals and journals from regions such as Latin America, made their articles OA when they started publishing parallel electronic versions. From about 2002 on, newly founded professional OA publishing firms using article-processing charges to fund their operations have emerged. Over the years, there have been several experiments with new forms of peer review, media enhancements, and the inclusion of structured data sets with articles. In recent years, the growth of OA publishing has also been facilitated by the availability of open-source software for journal publishing.The case studies illustrate how a new technology and a business model enabled by new technology can be harnessed to find new innovative ways for the organization and content of scholarly publishing. Several recent launches of OA journals by major subscription publishers demonstrate that OA is rapidly gaining acceptance as a sustainable alternative to subscription-based scholarly publishing.

AB  - We introduce SciWING, an open-source soft-ware toolkit which provides access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models for scientific document processing (SDP) tasks, such as citation string parsing, logical structure recovery and citation intent classification. Compared to other toolkits, SciWING follows a full neural pipeline and provides a Python inter-face for SDP. When needed, SciWING provides fine-grained control for rapid experimentation with different models by swapping and stacking different modules. Transfer learning from general and scientific documents specific pre-trained transformers (i.e., BERT, SciBERT, etc.) can be performed. SciWING incorporates ready-to-use web and terminal-based applications and demonstrations to aid adoption and development. The toolkit is available from http://sciwing.io and the demos are available at http://rebrand.ly/sciwing-demo.

AB  - EDITOR'S SUMMARY While the conventions of bibliographic citation have been long established, the sole focus is on reference to other scholarly works. Access to the data serving as the basis for scholarly work has been limited. Data citation extends important access to material that has been largely unavailable for sharing, verification and reuse. The Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles, finalized in February 2014, is a formal statement pulling together practices used in the research and publishing arenas and in common use. The declaration encompasses eight principles that stress the importance and legitimacy of data, the need to give scholarly credit to contributors and the importance of data as evidence. Cited data should have unique and persistent identifiers, and the citation should facilitate human and machine access and support verification and interoperability. The principles are expected to have broad impact on research, recognition and scholarly publishing.

AB  - Social networking sites can seem frivolous and pointless to academics, but specialized academic social networking sites are gaining popularity in certain disciplines and with certain faculty.These academic social networks were briefly discussed in a previous column, as was the new intersection between social media and scholarly publishing, but academic social networks are an interesting online space that merit their own discussion (Ovadia 2013).This column looks at ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net) and Academia.edu,two of the more popular academic social networks.Social networking functionality is increasingly common in all kinds of tools, though.Citation management products, like Mendeley, Zotero, and CiteU-Like, in addition to managing citations for users, also have social media features, allowing users to find and follow each other.However, those three tools are primarily citation managers that also have social networking functionality.ResearchGate and Academia.eduare primarily social networking sites.Online social networks exist along a continuum.Something like Facebook, while used for a multitude of purposes, is probably most frequently used for informal communication between friends of some degree.Something like LinkedIn is used for professional communication and career networking.Academic social networks are even more specific, catering to those associated with academic institutions and specializing in academic activities like sharing papers and data sets.They also provide publication analytics and facilitate the exchange of information.Both ResearchGate and Academia.eduallow users to post public questions to the community, much like Quora, another online question-and-answer site.Both networks group users by

AB  - Neural network models enjoy success on language tasks related to Web documents, including news and Wikipedia articles. However, the characteristics of scientific publications pose specific challenges that have yet to be satisfactorily addressed: the discourse structure of scientific documents crucial in scholarly document processing (SDP) tasks, the interconnected nature of scientific documents, and their multimodal nature. We survey modern neural network learning methods that tackle these challenges: those that can model discourse structure and their interconnectivity and use their multimodal nature. We also highlight efforts to collect large-scale datasets and tools developed to enable effective deep learning deployment for SDP. We conclude with a discussion on upcoming trends and recommend future directions for pursuing neural natural language processing approaches for SDP.

AB  - The FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) constitute a guide whose aim is to improve the management of digital scholarly resources. Nevertheless, the literature regarding data services other than data repositories is still scarce.OpenEdition is a digital infrastructure for open scholarly communication in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) that carried out an internal full review to assess the degree of FAIRness of its activities. The objective of this paper is to present the methodology employed by OpenEdition’s team and the recommendations for the FAIRification of a publishing system, and hence, the elements for the FAIR Publishing Toolkit. The FAIR review was conducted in three main phases: preparation, assessment, and result phase, which listed the recommendations for the FAIR principles implementation. The preparation phase gathered the available information to define the perimeter of the FAIR review. It comprised two steps: the landscape study and the exam of actual use cases. The assessment phase contextualized the FAIR principles according to the scholarly publishing context, defined the datasets to be analyzed, carried outa FAIR maturity review per dataset, and analyzed the state of the art of some important FAIR-related elements. The result phase produced the recommendations, organized as priorities and extended objectives. The priority recommendations regard persistent identifiers and licensing policies. The extended objectives focus on authors' information management, controlled vocabularies, machine-actionability, and Digital Management Plans.

AB  - Scholarly publishing is undergoing a transformation that affects every participant in the information chain. Serials used to be a relatively uncomplicated activity, driven by the need of scholars and researchers to publish (see Fig 1). Until the 1980s, libraries found it possible to maintain coherent collections of the journals required to serve the teaching and research needs of their individual institutions, albeit at the expense of their monograph collections. Since that time, both journal price inflation and the growth in the number of journals and the numbers of papers published have outstripped the ability of even the most lavishly funded library to purchase what faculty and students demand. At the same time, modern technology has, in the last few years, offered us the opportunity to develop new media of distribution for scholarly literature: media that offer the researcher

AB  - Researchers from Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC) surveyed faculty members from 10 academic research libraries to learn about scholarly publishing activities, attitudes, and policies. Areas of special interest included the effect of publishers' intellectual property policies and institutional promotion and tenure processes on library faculty publishing decisions. The library faculty members were also asked about their experience in negotiating for additional rights from publishers and their experience in self-archiving their research. The researchers wanted to determine if there were any correlation between a library faculty member's rank and tenure status and the number of peer-reviewed articles published in refereed journals.

AB  - The World Wide Web is opening up access to documents and data for scholars. However it has not yet impacted on one of the primary activities in research: assessing new findings in the light of current knowledge and debating it with colleagues. The ClaiMaker system uses a directed graph model with similarities to hypertext, in which new ideas are published as nodes, which other contributors can build on or challenge in a variety of ways by linking to them. Nodes and links have semantic structure to facilitate the provision of specialist services for interrogating and visualizing the emerging network. By way of example, this paper is grounded in a ClaiMaker model to illustrate how new claims can be described in this structured way.

AB  - Since the founding of the Royal Society in the 1660s and with the development of disciplinary fields in the later nineteenth century, scholarly societies have established themselves as mediators of the professional lives of faculty and as vital components of the ecology of scholarly communication. In their interactions with libraries, societies may appear primarily as publishers of newsletters, books, reports, journals, indexes, and databases, but they also promote the creation and diffusion of knowledge by serving as hubs for professional activity, contributors to the making of public policy and opinion, providers of education, representatives of the interests of their members, and, more generally, shapers of the institutions and purposes of higher education.

AB  - When I first began working with electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), the conversation in libraries appeared to revolve around open access and publication embargoes. It seemed to me that the primary task for scholarly communication librarians in this area was to broaden access to graduate research while protecting future publication opportunities for individual authors. As graduate students begin to publish earlier in their careers, the relationship between the doctoral dissertation and scholarly publishing is evolving. Many students now include their own previously published work in a dissertation, requiring instruction in publication contracts and copyright transfer agreements at the point of submission to the graduate school.

AB  - Several libraries have become active partners in Open Access publishing of books in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Not only have libraries started up their own presses, they are also collaborating with existing presses or forming alliances with other institutions on campus such as scholarly communication offices, ICT departments, and academic research centers. By combining institutional strengths and enabling the sharing of resources across institutions, these collaborations offer synergies and efficiencies in the scholarly book publishing business. This paper examines this new function taken on by libraries. Using research conducted by the European project "Open Access Publishing in European Networks" (OAPEN) on OA publishing models and business models for books, we look at libraries' motives and challenges and explore how their new roles enable them to serve their customers in the most effective way. By combining digital repositories with scholarly publishing, libraries can facilitate and support HSS book publishing and can help sustain the scholarly monograph in the transition towards digital formats and an Open Access future.

AB  - Key points The open access movement continues to gain pace, resulting in increasing regulatory requirements that constrain business models. Plan S itself may only have a modest immediate effect on industry‐wide sustainability but is the clearest indication of the ‘direction of travel’ for our industry yet. Recent negotiations between publishers and consortia represent a ‘bigger deal’ and may therefore lead to even greater economic power for large commercial publishers. Societies have a greater role than merely allowing researchers to get credit for and disseminate their work. A one‐size‐fits‐all model of open access may threaten the sustainability of other community services managed by learned societies. Do not panic about Plan S! Look to the needs of your community and offer a balanced portfolio of publications and services.

AB  - This study explores possible futures for university-based library publishing services (LPS) and uses scenario planning as its research method. The study posits that the major force in developing LPS is the level of funding from the host university, with the most uncertain factor being whether faculty will adopt LPS. The study participants comprised university library directors, library managers responsible for publishing services, and library association personnel and consultants involved in publishing. Many participants saw collaborating with multiple libraries and other stakeholder organizations to establish publishing cooperatives as essential. Issues discussed include whether university libraries will embrace this role, faculties' level of satisfaction with existing services, divergent disciplinary experiences, opportunism as a mechanism to develop services, technology challenges, international dynamics, traditional vs. new forms of scholarly publishing, and publishing cost considerations.

AB  - &gt;&gt; See video of presentation (28 min.) The primary goal of scholarly communication is improving human knowledge and sharing is the key to achieve this goal: sharing ideas, sharing methodologies, sharing of results, sharing data, information and knowledge. Although the concept of sharing applies to all phases of scholarly communication, most often the only visible part is the final publication, with the journal article as a most common type. The traditional characteristics of the present journals allow only limited possibilities for sharing the knowledge. Basic functions, registration, dissemination, certification, and storage, are still present but they are no more effective in the network environment. Registration is too slow, there are various barriers to dissemination, certification system has many shortcomings, and used formats are not suitable for the long term preservation and storage. Although the journals today are digital and various powerful technologies are available, they are still focused on their unaltered printed versions. This presentation will discuss possible evolution of journal article to become more compliant with users' needs and to enable “the four R’s of openness” – reuse, redistribute, revise and remix (Hilton, Wiley, Stein, &amp; Johnson, 2010).Several aspects of openness will be presented and discussed: open access, open data, open peer review, open authorship, and open formats. With digital technology which has become indispensable in the creation, collection, processing and storage of data in all scientific disciplines the way of conducting scientific research has changed and the concept of "data-driven science" has been introduced (Ware &amp; Mabe, 2009). Sharing research data enhances the capabilities of reproducing the results, reuse maximizes the value of research, accelerating the advancement of science, ensuring transparency of scientific research, reducing the possibility of bias in the interpretation of results and increasing the credibility of published scientific knowledge. The open peer review can ensure full transparency of the entire process of assessment and help to solve many problems in the present scholarly publishing. Through the process of the open peer review each manuscript can be immediately accessible, reviewers can publicly demonstrate their expertise and could be rewarded, and readers can be encouraged to make comments and views and to become active part of the scholarly communication process. The trend to to describe the author's contribution is also present, which will certainly lead to a reduced number of “ghost”, "guest" and "honorary" authors, and will help to establish better standards for author’s identification.Various web technologies can be used also for the semantic enhancement of the article. One of the most important aspects of semantic publication is the inclusion of the research data, to make them available to the user as an active data that can be manipulated. It is possible to integrate data from external sources, or to merge the data from different resources (data fusion) (Shotton, 2012), so the reader can gain further understanding of the presented data. Additional options provide merging data from different articles, with the addition of the component of time. Other semantic enhancement can include enriched bibliography, interactive graphical presentations, hyperlinks to external resources, tagged text, etc.Instead of mostly static content, journals can offer readers dynamic content that includes multimedia, "living mathematics", “executable articles”, etc. Videos highlighting critical points in the research process, 3D representations of chemical compounds or art works, audio clips with the author's reflections and interviews, and animated simulations or models of ocean currents, tides, temperature and salinity structure, can became soon common part of every research article. The diversity of content and media, operating systems (GNU / Linux, Apple Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows), and software tools that are available to researchers, suggests the usage of the appropriate open formats. Different formats have their advantages and disadvantages and it would be necessary to make multiple formats available, some of which are suitable for "human" reading (including printing on paper), and some for machine reading that can be used by computers without human intervention. Characteristics and possibilities of several formats will be discussed, including XML as the most recommended format, which can enable granulate document structure as well as deliver semantics to the human reader or to the computer.Literature:Hilton, J.

AB  - Over the last twenty years, library publishing has emerged in higher education as a new class of publisher. Conceived as a response to commercial publishing practices that have strained library budgets and prevented scholars from openly licensing and sharing their works, library publishing is both a local service program and a broader movement to disrupt the current scholarly publishing arena. It is growing both in numbers of publishers and numbers of works produced. The commercial publishing framework which determines the viability of monetizing a product is not necessarily applicable for library publishers who exist as a common good to address the needs of their academic communities. Like any business venture, however, library publishers must develop a clear service model and business plan in order to create shared expectations for funding streams, quality markers, as well as technical and staff capacity. As the field is maturing from experimental projects to full programs, library publishers are formalizing their offerings and limitations. The anatomy of a library publishing business plan is presented and includes the principles of the program, scope of services, and staffing requirements. Other aspects include production policies, financial structures, and measures of success.

AB  - An output of the Data policy standardisation and implementation Interest Group (IG) of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) More journals and publishers – and funding agencies and institutions – are introducing research data policies. But as the prevalence of policies increases, there is potential to confuse researchers and support staff with numerous or conflicting policy requirements. We define and describe 14 features of journal research data policies and arrange these into a set of six standard policy types or tiers, which can be adopted by journals and publishers to promote data sharing in a way that encourages good practice and is appropriate for their audience's perceived needs. Policy features include coverage of topics such as data citation, data repositories, data availability statements, data standards and formats, and peer review of research data. These policy features and types have been created by reviewing the policies of multiple scholarly publishers, which collectively publish more than 10,000 journals, and through discussions and consensus building with multiple stakeholders in research data policy via the Data Policy Standardisation and Implementation Interest Group of the Research Data Alliance. Implementation guidelines for the standard research data policies for journals and publishers are also provided, along with template policy texts which can be implemented by journals in their Information for Authors and publishing workflows. We conclude with a call for collaboration across the scholarly publishing and wider research community to drive further implementation and adoption of consistent research data policies. <strong>Publisher's Note:</strong> a correction article relating to this publication has been published and can be found at <a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-017">http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-017</a>

AB  - The disintermediation that will inevitably result from the increased electronic publication of specialized scholarly information affords an excellent opportunity for one of the traditional intermediaries (e.g., libraries, publishers) to assume responsibilities previously held by other intermediaries. Members of the academy should use this opportunity to take back the responsibility for a significant portion of the specialized scholarly publishing that has, in the traditional environment, been placed in the hands of external publishers. The most imposing impediment to such a reappropriation by the academy derives from the inability of institutions to cooperate with each other. If new attitudes could be created within the academy to circumvent that obstruction, then an academy-based process of scholarly information exchange would finally be feasible. One effective model for such a new form of scholarly publishing would be to establish separate domains, or designated channels, for individual disciplines.

AB  - Background: In the face of extensive, developed-world library endorsement of open access (OA) and not-for-profit publishing, large commercial journal publishers are, paradoxically, increasing market share by means of economies of scale brought about in part by ownership concentration.Analysis: While the market success of commercial journal publishers may benefit from ownership concentration, it is argued that market-oriented innovation has also contributed to their market success. A review of the very lively state of market-oriented innovation in journal publishing and usage metrics is undertaken and three innovation proposals derived from commercial magazines are introduced.Conclusion and implications: The adoption of reader-focused features of commercial journals and the adaptation of the mobile-oriented strategy of commercial magazine publishers that respond to the modern digital information environment and mindset are recommended as strategically sound. Partnering with low-cost promoting, OA-oriented libraries may hobble the ability of not-for-profit journals to maximize their value to researchers.Originality/value: The weakness of OA as a constraining publishing strategy is brought forward and compared to readership building through innovation focused on usage.

AB  - During the last years, dramatic changes in the electronic publishing landscape have created new roles and changed the traditional ones. Presently, some libraries have capitalised on their experience and knowledge in information technology and electronic publishing to undertake such activities, while at the same time they spearhead the campaign for Open Access spreading within academic communities. The Library &amp; Information Centre (LIC) of the University of Patras (UoP), Greece, has been playing an active role in promoting Open Access (OA) in Greece. Since 2007, LIC has been experimenting with OA publishing practices and tools within the framework of various R&amp;D projects. Two of the major results of these efforts are the ‘Pasithee’ e-publishing platform and the ‘Dexamene’ digital archive for Greek scholarly journals. Both platforms are based on OJS-Open Journal Systems e-publishing software. The two facilities were appropriately modified to meet the LIC’s publishing and archiving requirements respectively. Currently two journals are being hosted on each platform and all four are from the Humanities. The LIC is negotiating with more publishers and editorial teams to host their journals. In this article we focus on: - technical and managerial key issues of the development and operation phases, - services and procedures, - the business model, - technological, procedural and legal issues and problems that were encountered when working together with publishers, editors and authors, and - future plans for improving and upgrading our e-publishing services into an integrated institutional platform to cover all kinds of publications and data types (monographs, conference proceedings, teaching material, bulletins, magazines etc.). The article concludes with a succinct presentation of the Directory of Greek Digital Resources, a pilot infrastructure developed by the LIC which indexes and presents digital publishing initiatives in Greece and aims to become a formal registry of Greek scholarly resources in digital format.

AB  - Scientists at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines, generate a large volume of research results emanating from donor-funded projects. The main objective is to disseminate, as widely as possible, the results of IRRI's research. There is also a strong push to provide free open access to these information resources through modes convenient to researchers in both developing and developed countries.&#x0D; &#x0D; Certain instruments for open access (OA) are already in place at IRRI, including links to full-text publications posted on the Institute's Web site (http://www.irri.org/), especially via the Library branch site (http://ricelib.irri.cgiar.org/), the Rice Knowledge Bank (http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/), and Rice Publications Archive (http://rice-publications.irri.org/). The joint initiatives of the Library and the Institute's main science publishing units, particularly Communication and Publications Services and the Training Center, typify a convergence of practices to overcome hurdles to OA implementation. &#x0D; &#x0D; This paper explores how the links in IRRI's scholarly publishing chain, bridging information management and publishing, can effectively deliver public goods (knowledge about rice, in this case) to the intended primary users -- researchers and extensionists in the national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES) in developing countries.&#x0D; &#x0D; It also discusses publishing models for delivering public goods generated by an international research organization. To meet its mission, IRRI must employ various demand-supply models to disseminate information. Open access publishing is one model to adopt but first, the onus is on the Institute to overcome issues such as intellectual property rights, funding, and connectivity.&#x0D; &#x0D; IRRI's donors, NARES partners, governments, and rice farmers and consumers expect it to create and share information for the common good, and it strives to convert its resources into electronic format for delivery over the Internet. However, not all its stakeholders are connected.&#x0D; &#x0D; To create impact, IRRI must deliver information through whatever appropriate form, be it cutting-edge digital versions or traditional hard-copy books. This paper discusses this dilemma and hopes to encourage further research and thought on open access publishing.

AB  - Payment for publication is an increasingly prevalent component of the scholarly publishing landscape, and librarians have a professional requirement to be aware of the current situation. This paper explores this phenomenon, including an analysis of what is being charged for publication. Comparisons between the different types of open access publishing, in fully open access and in hybrid journals, show the considerably higher costs of hybrid open access. Despite this discrepancy there remain issues with the discoverability of some hybrid open access articles. Payment for publication is changing the funding base for scholarly publication therefore broadening the administrative areas responsible for management of the system. New relationships between players across the sector need to be developed and fostered. To participate in this changing landscape librarians need knowledge of the source of institutional and government funds for article processing charges and these funding bodies' approaches to funding hybrid. New offerings from publishers, such as membership schemes and mega journals further complicate the situation, not helped by challenges in obtaining data about what is being spent in this area. This increasingly complex situation potentially expands the role of libraries within institutions into the future, which is preferable to becoming irrelevant.

AB  - Given the rising costs of journal subscriptions and the difficulty that authors have in retaining rights to their own works, reform in the scholarly publishing industry is needed. This article, the first in a two-part series, presents an overview of the crisis in scholarly communication and discusses the groundwork that must be laid in order to develop successful programs to address the crisis on college and university campuses. As the de facto centers of scholarship and research on campus, libraries must educate faculty and advocate for more sustainable publishing models. Programs developed by the Boston Library Consortium and its member institutions are discussed.

AB  - Scholarly publishing is the information marketplace in which academic libraries function, and major shifts in traditional publishing and pricing models are in process. Library consortia have long been viewed as a means of increasing purchasing power and reducing costs. In late 2010, the Five College Libraries (FCL) hired R2 Consulting, LLC to investigate and make recommendations regarding how the Libraries cooperate more closely on the acquisition, management, and delivery of electronic resources. This study examines and evaluates how other academic library consortia are licensing and acquiring electronic books, databases, journals and streaming media. The organizations, activities, processes, history and trends of e-resource acquisitions and collection development at the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL), Orbis Cascade Alliance (OCA), Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN) and Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC) are presented with data collected by the author. Additional context is provided through a literature review, and a discussion of current practices provides a sampling of the new directions academic library consortia are taking and the challenges they face.

AB  - This case study aims to examine an academic library’s roles in facilitating the creation and hosting of open access student-run research journals. In addition to providing an online platform to host the journals, the library acquaints students with scholarly publishing, assists them in securing various resources available on campus, and offers support for content management. There are challenges and opportunities for the library as it undertakes the responsibility of hosting student journals. The article concludes with a discussion of possible topics for future research.

AB  - When academics’ opinions, which are published in academic journals as letters to the editor or commentaries, are retracted based on sensitivities and objections that are raised for example on social media, there needs to be a reflection on what this might represent. On one hand, an opinion is precisely that, i.e., a subjective and biased view about an issue. Those views might even be radical, unpopular, or insensitive, but ultimately approved by editors for publication nonetheless. To maintain a truly sustainable scholarly discourse, the best academic way to counter such opinions is by allowing disagreeing voices to express themselves, also as letters to the editor or commentaries. Pressure-induced retractions of opinions not only stifle academic debate, they send the message that opinions need to be moderated and standardized to meet a publishing market that is being increasingly driven by legal parameters, political correctness, as well as business and commercial values rather than academic ones. In an environment of restrictive academic freedom, what emerges is an academia in which the way things are said, tone, and the sensitivity of those that might be affected are given greater weight than the message itself. By cherry-picking parts of the message that detractors or critics might disagree with, the original message may be drowned out by the noise of the objectors. The struggle of academics to liberally voice their opinions in the scholarly publishing realm, and to preserve those opinions, has never been more acute in this age of misinformation and radicalism fueled by polarized social and mass media. Is the politicization and/or commercialization of academia, alongside the retraction of opinions, stifling open and healthy academic debate, or expressing itself as the retraction of opinions, and does this represent a distinct form of “cancel culture” in academia and academic publishing?

AB  - ABSTRACT Sydney eScholarship is a framework and suite of services that enables integration of digital collections, open access repositories, and research data services with scholarly publishing. The primary platform for scholarly publishing at the University of Sydney – Sydney University Press – currently operates as part of the University Library's Sydney eScholarship program. Three sets of publishing initiatives demonstrate the integration of the digital library with scholarly publishing to deliver different forms to different audiences: (i) new publishing and the literary canons – rediscovery, customisation and critical interpretations; (ii) book and web – open access publishing; (iii) publishing in the mix – data and experimental scholarly publishing.

AB  - raphers and reference librarians provide subjectspecific Websites and blogs for their users, we can provide a broader look at new resources recently purchased by the library.For example, a new e-resources blog with an RSS feed could be a way to push information about new acquisitions to the library community.Tagging within the blog could provide access to the blog entries by specific subject or format.Another possibility is using this technology to push information about outages in databases or library systems.Currently many libraries provide this information on a static Webpage, depending on patrons and other library staff to check there when something isn't working.Adding an RSS feed to this Webpage would allow the library to push out information about outages to patrons and potentially stop some of the confusion and complaints before they come through to library staff.

AB  - Purpose Peer reviewer evaluations of academic papers are known to be variable in content and overall judgements but are important academic publishing safeguards. This article introduces a sentiment analysis program, PeerJudge, to detect praise and criticism in peer evaluations. It is designed to support editorial management decisions and reviewers in the scholarly publishing process and for grant funding decision workflows. The initial version of PeerJudge is tailored for reviews from F1000Research's open peer review publishing platform. Design/methodology/approach PeerJudge uses a lexical sentiment analysis approach with a human-coded initial sentiment lexicon and machine learning adjustments and additions. It was built with an F1000Research development corpus and evaluated on a different F1000Research test corpus using reviewer ratings. Findings PeerJudge can predict F1000Research judgements from negative evaluations in reviewers' comments more accurately than baseline approaches, although not from positive reviewer comments, which seem to be largely unrelated to reviewer decisions. Within the F1000Research mode of post-publication peer review, the absence of any detected negative comments is a reliable indicator that an article will be ‘approved’, but the presence of moderately negative comments could lead to either an approved or approved with reservations decision. Originality/value PeerJudge is the first transparent AI approach to peer review sentiment detection. It may be used to identify anomalous reviews with text potentially not matching judgements for individual checks or systematic bias assessments.

AB  - Abstract Most researchers today are bombarded with spam email solicitations from questionable scholarly publishers. These emails solicit article manuscripts, editorial board service, and even ad hoc peer reviews. These “predatory” publishers exploit the scholarly publishing process, patterning themselves after legitimate scholarly publishers yet performing little or no peer review and quickly accepting submitted manuscripts and collecting fees from submitting authors. These counterfeit publishers and journals have published much junk science? especially in the field of cosmology? threatening the integrity of the academic record. This paper examines the current state of predatory publishing and advises researchers how to navigate scholarly publishing to best avoid predatory publishers and other scholarly publishing-related perils.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel framework for a scholarly journal – a token‐curated registry (TCR). This model originates in the field of blockchain and cryptoeconomics and is essentially a decentralized system where tokens (digital currency) are used to incentivize quality curation of information. TCR is an automated way to create lists of any kind where decisions (whether to include N or not) are made through voting that brings benefit or loss to voters. In an academic journal, TCR could act as a tool to introduce community‐driven decisions on papers to be published, thus encouraging more active participation of authors/reviewers in editorial policy and elaborating the idea of a journal as a club. TCR could also provide a novel solution to the problems of editorial bias and the lack of rewards/incentives for reviewers. In the paper, we discuss core principles of TCR, its technological and cultural foundations, and finally analyse the risks and challenges it could bring to scholarly publishing.

AB  - Much of the debate about open access has focused on the principle of access for scientists and the economics of such a change.There is a second principle to consider: the full power of new technological approaches such as text mining, collaborative filtering, and semantic indexing, are not resulting in powerful new public resources.Despite real success in the open access movement, most scholarly research is unavailable, either for study or for processing by software.According to the Budapest open access initiative, "There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature.By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited." 1 Open access journals are entering the mainstream of scholarly publishing. 2 The Directory of Open Access Journals (www.doaj.org), a listing of "free, full text, quality controlled scientific and scholarly journals," includes 2478 journals, with on average more than one journal a day added in 2006 (121 999 articles are tracked). 3Open access journals have earned top impact factors in fields such as biology and bioinformatics, 4 5 as well as high immediacy factors. 6ut most journals are non-open access.Many nonopen access journals and publishers tackle the access problem by allowing authors to post copies of their works on the internet; this is known as "self archiving."Self archiving by authors is also growing rapidly.Between March 2005 and October 2006, the number of institutional archives tracked at the Registry of Open Access Repositories (http://archives.eprints.org)has grown by nearly one every other day, and the number of records in those archives has grown by nearly 600%, to 1.2 million papers.Open access is here to stay, in one form or another.

AB  - INTRODUCTION As academic libraries expand their scholarly communication support, they also need to find ways to help educate graduate students about this area as well as market themselves. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM The University of Nevada, Reno Libraries created a one-day symposium, called Manuscript Accepted!, aimed at graduate students and early career faculty that would use faculty and library expertise to lead panels and workshops. This article discusses planning for the event, including collaborating with other on-campus groups, working with publishers for financial support, and planning a program that would meet a variety of needs. Assessment of the first two symposiums, held in 2019 and 2020, shows that attendees valued the event while also highlighting the need for more targeted support for specific areas, such as the humanities. NEXT STEPS The Libraries plans to continue Manuscript Accepted! as a one-day symposium, although it will also look to ways to expand attendance. Finally, the Libraries is investigating ways to create smaller events that could be tied into the Manuscript Acceptance! brand but that help meet other needs of our attendees.

AB  - Like Hegel’s owl of Minerva, scholars are arriving at the realization of the existence of the knowledge economy after dusk. (Drahos and Braithwaite, 2002, p. 39)Houghton and Oppenheim’s cost–benefit analysis of different forms of scholarly publishing is a major contribution in considering the case for open access and for open institutional repositories as a standard resource in publicly-funded universities. Understanding these issues through empirically-informed profiles of national systems of research and innovation is a significant advance, but to focus only on this is to be distracted from significant and more general issues about the ways in which knowledge is produced, particularly in universities, and the requirements and opportunities for such work in the contemporary knowledge economy. As with Hegel’s owl of wisdom, the true meaning of major new ways of doing things can only be appreciated later in the day, when both the innovation and its implications are clearer.

AB  - ABSTRACT In summer 2009 ALPSP undertook the first industry‐wide survey into scholarly book publishing practice. This article covers the key findings and attempts to describe the current scholarly book and e‐book publishing landscape. Publishers' development of e‐books varies considerably from early experimentation to being a standard component of their publishing programme. However, publishers of all shapes and sizes have developed some common policies and practices despite the rapid evolution of an emerging element of scholarly publishing. E‐books currently make up a small, if growing, proportion of total book sales, although they are currently one of the most talked about developments in the entire publishing industry.

AB  - We present the systems we submitted for the shared tasks of the Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing at EMNLP 2020. Our approaches to the tasks are focused on exploiting large Transformer models pre-trained on huge corpora and adapting them to the different shared tasks. For tasks 1A and 1B of CL-SciSumm we are using different variants of the BERT model to tackle the tasks of "cited text span" and "facet" identification. For the summarization tasks 2 of CL-SciSumm, LaySumm and LongSumm we make use of different variants of the PEGASUS model, with and without fine-tuning, adapted to the nuances of each one of those particular tasks.

AB  - In this column, Mike Furlough writes about repositories from a user services perspective. His engaging and accessible article provides a fascinating history of hype, a primer on technical tools, and thoughtful reflections on the future of institutional repositories. Mike Furlough joined The Pennsylvania State University Libraries in 2006 as the assistant dean for Scholarly Communications and co-director of the Office of Digital Scholarly Publishing. Furlough's graduate training is in American Literature, but he ran away to join the University of Virginia Library, where he developed and led a number of services to support digital scholarship. He currently serves as a member of the Association of College and Research Libraries' Scholarly Communications Committee and begins editing a column on that topic for CR a vault or sepulchre. (1) Institutional repository (IR) often refers to a service that supports and encourages the deposit of student- and faculty-created materials, primarily open-access versions of research articles that have been formally published elsewhere or not at all. The early energy surrounding IRs centered on a hope that promoting open access could serve as a countermeasure to commercial publishing power and its ability to distort the market for knowledge. Taking control of our institutions' research by providing the ability to distribute this information to the world in an open-access mode seemed to be an inevitable outcome of the Internet. What follows is a brief history of IR hype. In July 2002, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported 'Superarchives' Could Hold All Scholarly Output: Online Collections by Institutions May Challenge the Role of Journal Publishers. (2) Also in 2002, a Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) position paper declared that institutional repositories--digital collections capturing and preserving the intellectual output of a single or multi-university community.... provide a critical component in reforming the system of scholarly communication--a component that expands access to research, reasserts control over scholarship by the academy, increases competition and reduces the monopoly power of journals, and brings economic relief and heightened relevance to the institutions and libraries that support them. (3) But in 2004 The Chronicle provided an update: Papers Wanted: Online Archives Run by Universities Struggle to Attract Material. (4) IRs soon became the butt of jokes, even inside the community of practitioners. In March 2006, Dorothea Salo, an institutional manager, rechristened herself in her blog. …

AB  - The Scholarly Document Processing (SDP) workshop is to encourage more efforts on natural language understanding of scientific task. It contains three shared tasks and we participate in the LongSumm shared task. In this paper, we describe our text summarization system, SciSummPip, inspired by SummPip (Zhao et al., 2020) that is an unsupervised text summarization system for multi-document in News domain. Our SciSummPip includes a transformer-based language model SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019) for contextual sentence representation, content selection with PageRank (Page et al., 1999), sentence graph construction with both deep and linguistic information, sentence graph clustering and within-graph summary generation. Our work differs from previous method in that content selection and a summary length constraint is applied to adapt to the scientific domain. The experiment results on both training dataset and blind test dataset show the effectiveness of our method, and we empirically verify the robustness of modules used in SciSummPip with BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019a).

AB  - Peer review constitutes a core component of scholarly publishing; yet it demands substantial expertise and training, and is susceptible to errors and biases. Various applications of NLP for peer reviewing assistance aim to support reviewers in this complex process, but the lack of clearly licensed datasets and multi-domain corpora prevent the systematic study of NLP for peer review. To remedy this, we introduce NLPeer– the first ethically sourced multidomain corpus of more than 5k papers and 11k review reports from five different venues. In addition to the new datasets of paper drafts, camera-ready versions and peer reviews from the NLP community, we establish a unified data representation and augment previous peer review datasets to include parsed and structured paper representations, rich metadata and versioning information. We complement our resource with implementations and analysis of three reviewing assistance tasks, including a novel guided skimming task.Our work paves the path towards systematic, multi-faceted, evidence-based study of peer review in NLP and beyond. The data and code are publicly available.

AB  - This paper proposes the application of the three main Bibliometrics laws –Lotka, Zipf, and Bradford- to address the following questions: (i) How to be sure of the quality of publishers and contents in scholarly publishing, and (ii) How to determine content reliability. Our main goal is to evaluate the visibility of Transinformação, a Brazilian scholarly journal in the information science area, according to its productivity, citation counts, and performance indicators. This study focusses on the concepts of Bibliometrics and Scholarly Journals, presenting a brief history of scholarly publishing and its accessibility in Brazil, as well as the software tools used in this work. This is an exploratory documentary study, based on descriptive mixed methods (i.e., both qualitative and quantitative), that analyzes 24 years of Transinformação issues, from its first edition in 1989 to 2011. Descriptive statistics tables are used to show the results obtained from analyses carried out with Publish or perish, Microsoft Excel, and Web of science Citespace tools.

AB  - Why Is Access to the Scholarly Journal Literature So Expensive? Bo-Christer Björk (bio) For more than 30 years the spiraling costs of scholarly journal subscriptions, often called the "serials crisis," have been a hotly debated topic. Academics and librarians have pointed out the high profit levels of the major commercial publishers, despite that the content they sell is provided by unpaid authors and reviewers. The publishers then resell it to the universities of these same authors and reviewers. Publishers have attempted to justify their prices by cost increases, their investments in information technology, and the value they add. A useful framework for understanding the situation is Michael Porter's five forces model for explaining the competitive conditions in an industry. Despite claims to the contrary, the degree of market concentration in scholarly publishing is not higher than that in many other industries, and it is not the main cause of the problem. But because the big deals of different publishers are complements rather than substitutes, the leading companies essentially do not compete for customers, in contrast to other industries, such as mobile phones or automobiles. The high barriers to new entrants, partly due to journal ranking lists and impact factors, as well as the low bargaining power of suppliers and customers, explain why this industry has been so well shielded from the disruptive forces of the Internet. The protected competitive position and high profitability are also major reasons why the big subscription publishers have been slow to adopt the open access business model. Background During the past three decades, there has been a continuing discussion about the subscription prices of peer-reviewed journals, which have risen faster than inflation. This phenomenon has been named the "serials crisis."1 Although publisher-wide electronic licenses such as ScienceDirect or Springer Link have largely replaced subscriptions to individual titles, the same price spiral seems to be continuing.2 [End Page 177] A related issue is the slower than expected transition to open access (OA) journals. Contrary to the early optimistic predictions 15 to 20 years ago, the growth has been linear, with a rate of only around 1 percentage point of the market share per annum.3 The major commercial publishers and learned societies have been reluctant to flip existing titles or start new OA ones. Instead, they have opted for the risk-free alternative of subscription journals offering paid OA for individual articles, a model called hybrid OA. University librarians and OA activists have spent much time trying to calculate "reasonable" journal costs and criticizing publishers for pricing leading to excessive profits.4 On the other side of the fence, publishers have tried to justify their prices by their high costs.5 The discussion has lately also concerned the pricing of articles in OA journals, so-called article processing charges (APCs).6 What many information science specialists and OA activists seem to ignore is that peer-reviewed journal publishing is a market like the trade in any other commodity or service. Despite that a large part of the raw material is provided pro bono by the academic community, scholarly publishing follows the same basic microeconomic rules of prices, set in an interplay between supply and demand, as well as the peculiarities of non-perfect markets characterized by oligopolies (a few big companies controlling the market). The so-called five forces model by the economist Michael Porter has for four decades been part of the standard curriculum at business schools for analyzing the competitive situation in different industries.7 The model is well suited also as a framework for a discussion of scholarly journal publishing. It offers plausible explanations both for the high pricing and for the slow transition to OA. The purpose of Porter's five forces framework is to analyze the key factors that together determine the competitive situation of an industry. The five forces that Porter claims define the overall level of competition are (1) industry rivalry, (2) the bargaining power of suppliers, (3) the bargaining power of buyers, (4) the threat of new entrants, and (5) the threat of substitutes. The model is usually visually represented in a figure where industry rivalry stands in the center and...

AB  - Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) of a document is a challenging problem that requires discourse-level understanding. Information extraction from scholarly articles nowadays is a critical use case for researchers to understand the underlying research quickly and move forward, especially in this age of infodemic. MRC on research articles can also provide helpful information to the reviewers and editors. However, the main bottleneck in building such models is the availability of human-annotated data. In this paper, firstly, we introduce a dataset to facilitate question answering (QA) on scientific articles. We prepare the dataset in a semi-automated fashion having more than 100k human-annotated context-question-answer triples. Secondly, we implement one baseline QA model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Additionally, we implement two models: the first one is based on Science BERT (SciBERT), and the second is the combination of SciBERT and Bi-Directional Attention Flow (Bi-DAF). The best model (i.e., SciBERT) obtains an F1 score of 75.46%. Our dataset is novel, and our work opens up a new avenue for scholarly document processing research by providing a benchmark QA dataset and standard baseline. We make our dataset and codes available here at https://github.com/TanikSaikh/Scientific-Question-Answering.

AB  - Open Access and the Big Deal are often thought to occupy opposite ends of the spectrum of openness in scholarly publishing. Universities in the Netherlands are changing that by negotiating OA publishing services into their Big Deals. This has been successfully arranged with three publishers already, and negotiations continue with Elsevier. While there are precedents for converting subscription payments to OA payments, such as the Sponsoring Coalition for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics, this new arrangement could have a big impact. The deal has the potential to quickly convert a large number of articles from toll access to OA and to do so without dramatically disturbing the scholarly publishing ecosystem. There are questions about its sustainability and scalability, but it's a project worth watching.

AB  - As the budget increases of the post-World War II era that favoured science and education were being rolled back in the 1970s, information and communicational technological (ICT) development began to be rolled out. Research libraries responded by developing data systems and expertise that led eventually to new services such as institutional repositories and journal hosting. Twenty years later, continued ICT development encouraged entrepreneurship in digital journal publishing among a variety of scholars in Canada and elsewhere. Globally, public and private sector funded digital projects emerged aimed at regime change in the circulation of research knowledge. These dramatic developments are noteworthy for themselves as well as in recognition of valuable library/researcher partnerships that leave content to scholars and administration to libraries. On the whole, these partnerships have not been extended to university press-based monograph publishing with the presses joining as a third partner. Instead calls for reorganization verge on subordinating university presses to institutional mandates that could well diminish freedom of inquiry. A three-way partnership among scholars, libraries and publishing professionals has much to recommend it. Such a partnership, cast as constructivist inquiry, or social science and humanities R&amp;D, would encourage extensive public sector participation scholarly publishing and open a long-overdue dynamic into the social science and humanities research.

AB  - This article examines the current difficulties faced in penetrating the world of scholarly communication technology. While there have been large strides forward in the disintermediation of digital publishing expertise—most notably by the Public Knowledge Project—a substantial number of barriers remain. This paper examines a case study in terms of scholarly typesetting and the Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) standard before moving to suggest three potential solutions: (1) The formation of open, non-commercial and inclusive (but structured) organizations dedicated to the group exploration and standardisation of scholarly publishing technology; (2) The collective authoring of as much technological and process documentation on scholarly publishing as is possible; (3) The modularisation of platforms and agreement on standards of interoperability. Only through such measures is it possible for researchers to reclaim the means of (re)production, for the remaining barriers are not difficult to understand, merely hard to discover.

AB  - Establishing Publication Services in the library at the University of Graz did more than broaden the service portfolio of the library. A convergence of expertise at the library, needs of researchers at the university, and ongoing changes in scholarly communication also contributed to the evolution of the library's role and profile. The new services offer first-level support for matters pertaining to scholarly publishing and communications. Furthermore, Publication Services has developed into a knowledge sharing platform, extending beyond the library to other administrative departments and creating a community of practice.

AB  - Recently significant initiatives have been launched for the dissemination of Open Access as part of the Open Science movement. Nevertheless, two other major pillars of Open Science such as Open Research Data (ORD) and Open Peer Review (OPR) are still in an early stage of development among the communities of researchers and stakeholders. The present study sought to unveil the perceptions of a medical and health sciences community about these issues. Through the investigation of researchers‘ attitudes, valuable conclusions can be drawn, especially in the field of medicine and health sciences, where an explosive growth of scientific publishing exists. A quantitative survey was conducted based on a structured questionnaire, with 179 valid responses. The participants in the survey agreed with the Open Peer Review principles. However, they ignored basic terms like FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and appeared incentivized to permit the exploitation of their data. Regarding Open Peer Review (OPR), participants expressed their agreement, implying their support for a trustworthy evaluation system. Conclusively, researchers need to receive proper training for both Open Research Data principles and Open Peer Review processes which combined with a reformed evaluation system will enable them to take full advantage of the opportunities that arise from the new scholarly publishing and communication landscape.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical framework and guidance, based on the authors’ local experience, for libraries investigating or in the early stages of planning to offer scholarly publishing services for journal literature. While the authors use a number of publishing tools and platforms at Penn State, based on the content and needs of the requester, here the focus is on a model of using Open Journal Systems for a range of needs from peer-reviewed scholarly journals to more informal publications such as student research. Design/methodology/approach – Penn State Libraries Publishing and Curation Services has been both defining the philosophy and building the mechanics for delivering a formal publishing services program for a variety of clients and formats. This article traces the authors’ journey as a facilitator within the research life cycle. Findings – The authors’ results from working with a range of clients show that there will need to be an equally varied range of publishing options to meet the expectations. A descriptive service template available in advance plus a flexible approach to implementation is the authors’solution. The authors use the concept of “tiers of service” where the Libraries and the journal proposers agree on roles and expectations as part of the negotiation and implementation processes. Such an approach allows for some creativity and also offers efficiency in dealing with the universal requirements for discoverability, appearance, workflow management and intellectual property oversight. Originality/value – The authors’ experience emphasizes the consultation and data gathering process, and its importance to a successful journal project collaboration.

AB  - Abstract Nationwide surveys of researchers in Finland in 2007 and 2016 distributed with the assistance of FinELib, the Finnish national consortium, show that researchers use a growing range of sources to find and access scholarly articles and that some reading patterns are changing. The percentage of articles found by searching and browsing are decreasing, while researchers are using more social ways to locate articles. Research social networking sites are rated as important to their work. They read more on-screen, although still print some material out for final reading. Reading patterns for books are different, as researchers still rely more on printed books than e-books, in spite of an increase in e-book collections through their libraries. This study shows a continuous process of incremental change, enabled by changes in scholarly publishing, social networking, and library collection decisions. More changes can be expected, as researchers adopt systems and patterns that fit with their work patterns and make the finding, locating, and reading of scholarly materials easier. Libraries must both lead and adapt to these new reading patterns by providing links and access to a variety of journal services and by maintaining a balance of print and e-book collections.

AB  - The serials literature from 2008 and 2009 reveals the new identity of the serials professional—one who embraces openness. Many forces have pushed the serials profession into a state of flux; among these are the recent economic recession, the evolution of scholarly publishing, and the concept of open systems and data. Chaotic change for serialists has evolved into opportunities to revise collection strategies, approach Big Deal purchasing in new ways, devise creative user-access solutions, and become stakeholders in the debates over scholarly communication. The literature also reveals serials professionals developing a Web 2.0 sensibility. These themes are presented in the review through a discussion of six major topics: sustainability of serials pricing, the future of the Big Deal, management of electronic resources, access, blurring and decline of formats, and Web 2.0.

Wholesale use of blockchain technologies is suggested as a possible replacement for scholarly publishers. There remain questions around the adoption of blockchain technologies, including privacy, researcher support, and fraudulent use. Blockchain technologies may provide a new means of understanding problems and customers' evolving expectations, but careful consideration is required of whether blockchain is the best solution.

AB  - The advantages of cooperation between research library associations can be demonstrated quite clearly. Where cooperation becomes essential is where there is a common cause to champion or an initiative to pursue for the common good. Thanks in part to the power of information communications technology, research is becoming increasingly international in scope. The members of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research teams are frequently drawn from across the world. Correspondingly, scholarly publishing (especially in medicine and the sciences) is dominated by a few multinational publishers. In this context, issues that play a vital role in global scholarly communication - such as copyright, journal pricing, the managing of datasets, digital preservation and open access - are issues for the research library community everywhere in the world. Certainly there are many challenges at the local or regional level. However there are definite roles that research library associations can play most effectively at the national or international level. It is clear that by sharing expertise, building partnerships and alliances, it is possible to address common issues much more effectively than when working alone. What is special is that potentially the most powerful form of cooperation is advocacy at the national and international levels. It is essential for research library associations to work together at the political level to move their agenda forward. Examples are lobbying about copyright legislation (nationally, or within the EC or at WIPO); or promoting the cause of Open Access. The unique value of LIBER is to provide a forum and a platform for European research library associations to explore and benefit from cooperation and their shared strength.

AB  - In this paper, we present our approach to solve the LongSumm 2020 Shared Task, at the 1st Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing. The objective of the long summaries task is to generate long summaries that cover salient information in scientific articles. The task is to generate abstractive and extractive summaries of a given scientific article. In the proposed approach, we are inspired by the concept of Argumentative Zoning (AZ) that de- fines the main rhetorical structure in scientific articles. We define two aspects that should be covered in scientific paper summary, namely Claim/Method and Conclusion/Result aspects. We use Solr index to expand the sentences of the paper abstract. We formulate each abstract sentence in a given publication as query to retrieve similar sentences from the text body of the document itself. We utilize a sentence selection algorithm described in previous literature to select sentences for the final summary that covers the two aforementioned aspects.

AB  - As a consequence of developments in information technology, the traditional information chain is subject to change: the separate functions in this chain become more and more integrated and the roles played by the traditional parties are most uncertain. Several new models in scholarly publishing and communication are emerging, in which the scientific community and the scientists themselves play a central role. It is more than natural for universities to support these developments in order to realise new models of scientific communication that are more in tune with the needs of the academic community than the traditional model, which has led to a serious serials crisis. An important step in this direction is that each university encourages scientists to make more use of ICT in their research publications. However, it is also necessary to give serious attention to organisational matters: in this respect every university should take responsibility for collecting, archiving and disclosing the scientific output of its own scientists. The provision of scientific information is the traditional core business of university libraries and it is a natural extension of this role for university libraries to support this development and to organise the processes needed. The paper describes the role that universities and their libraries have to play. It also gives some examples of library initiatives in this field, including an evaluation of their impact on the innovation of scientific communication.

AB  - Research as a digital enterprise has created new, often poorly addressed challenges for the management and curation of research to ensure continuity, transparency, and accountability. There is a common misunderstanding that curation can be considered at a later point in the research cycle or delegated or that it is too burdensome or too expensive due to a lack of efficient tools. This creates a curation gap between research practice and curation needs. We argue that this gap can be narrowed if curators provide attractive support that befits research needs and if researchers consistently manage their work according to generic concepts consistently from the beginning. A rather uniquely long-term case study demonstrates how such concepts have helped to pragmatically implement a research practice intentionally using only minimalist tools for sustained, self-contained archiving since 1989. The paper sketches the concepts underlying three core research activities. (i) handling of research data, (ii) reference management as part of scholarly publishing, and (iii) advancing theories through modelling and simulation. These concepts represent a universally transferable best research practice, while technical details are obviously prone to continuous change. We hope it stimulates researchers to manage research similarly and that curators gain a better understanding of the curation challenges research practice actually faces.

AB  - In the past, scholarly publishing grew in support of college and university needs to support the peer review tenure and promotion system, which itself developed to encourage the learning process through the generation of new knowledge. However, the continuation of this system of scholarly communications is threatened today by internal and external changes in four key areas: research and publishing, technology, government and society, and higher education itself. Electronic information systems hold some promise of enabling a new model for scholarly communication. Yet today we seem to be in the world of Lewis Carroll; scholarly communication had jam yesterday and it may have jam tomorrow, but scholars and library practitioners are struggling with how to have some jam today during a tortuous period of transition. This paper explores some of the causes of the current predicament and provides some modest proposals for collaborating with others in the scholarly, information, and technology communities as we venture through the looking-glass into the future of scholarly communication.

AB  - Abstract Economic forces have created the need for librarians to explore new methods of delivering information. Technological developments have created the means for librarians themselves to move into electronic publishing to increase cost-efficiency. A new consor tium model is proposed in which members would both generate scholarly work and access it at a lower cost. Included are overviews of scholarly publishing, copyright issues, technological feasibility, value added features, and the effects of the proposed consortium.

AB  - The advent of digital scholarship, together with the increasing momentum of open access for research, have thrown scholarly publishing into flux. In the shifting landscape of scholarly communication, libraries are taking on new roles in order to publish scholarship in innovative forms: by building institutional and data repositories, for example, or collaborating with faculty to develop multimedia monographs or open access journals. The Publishing Without Walls project at the University of Illinois is developing a service model for university libraries to support scholar-driven, openly accessible, scalable, and sustainable publishing practices. To this end, we are conducting a multimodal study of scholars' needs, objectives, and practices in this new age of publishing. This poster presents preliminary results of a large-scale survey of scholars, which aims to shed light on what and how scholars want to publish, when and why they choose to publish digitally, and how they understand the success of their digital publications. This survey, in tandem with the results of a series of interviews and focus groups, is actively informing the development of two digital monograph series at the University of Illinois University Library, along with a model for their development that may be useful to other libraries involved with publishing new modes of scholarship.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess current developments in scholarly publishing in Europe. Current models for disseminating content have limitations and Open Access models of publishing have been endorsed by the European Universities Association. The Harvard mandate for the deposit of materials in Open Access repositories is a bold new development, and the community is watching it with interest. It is possible that e-books may be the next large form of content to be made available to the user. Users certainly express interest in using this form of material. However, current library systems need to be developed in order to cope with this mass of new content. E-theses, available in Open Access from institutional repositories, are a form of content that is made much more visible than the paper equivalents. The DART-Europe portal, supported by LIBER (Association of European Research Libraries) currently provides access to 100,000 research theses in 150 European Universities. At an institutional and academic level, however, much remains to be done to embed Open Access into the landscape: the current situation is described in a new report for UCL (University College London), produced by RAND Europe.

We outlined several aspects of infrastructuring that we have undertaken since, with an explicit goal of supporting transnational workflows and participation in ESTS. In this editorial, we continue describing our infrastructural work, highlighting especially the work of content production at ESTS. We also discuss the relevance of our infrastructural work for open access (OA) scholarly publishing.

AB  - In this article, we raise questions about how bundling and independence show up in the scholarly publishing industry today, both for large conglomerates and for smaller commercial and nonprofit players. We then contemplate what interdependence might look like and how it might help to transform academic publishing. We end with findings from the Next Generation Library Publishing (NGLP) project (2019-2022) and its Collaborative Frameworks Working Group regarding a set of initial steps that we believe publishers, tools, and service providers might take together towards developing a collective publishing framework for open source, values-aligned tools and services.

AB  - Persistent identification of entities plays a major role in the progress of digitization of many fields. In the scholarly publishing realm there are already persistent identifiers (PID) for papers (DOI), people (ORCID), organisation (GRID, ROR), books (ISBN) but there is no generally accepted PID system for scholarly events such as conferences or workshops yet. This article describes the relevant use cases that motivate the introduction of persistent identifiers for conferences. The use cases were mainly derived from interviews, discussions with experts and their previous work. As primary stakeholders who are involved in the typical conference event life cycle researchers, conference organizers, and data consumers were identified. The resulting list of use cases illustrates how PIDs for conference events will improve the current situation for these stakeholders and help with problems they are facing today.

AB  - The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), a strategic initiative founded by the Association of Research Libraries, is a catalyst for promoting a scholarly communication environment that is more open, financially tenable, and supportive of the current research and information needs of academe. Established in response to imbalances in the scholarly publishing system and the skyrocketing costs of commercial peer-reviewed journals, SPARC is successfully leveraging digital technology and collaboratively finding ways to facilitate the access, sharing and use of scholarly information. This article explores three of SPARC's major programmatic areas (education, incubation, advocacy), and examines how the organization is playing an active role in developing alternate scholarly communication models while constructively influencing public policy in the service of libraries and university communities.

AB  - In this episode, we are discussing the project Developing Institutional Open Access Publishing Models to Advance Scholarly Communication, in short: DIAMAS. At the heart of the project is support for Diamond Open Access, i.e. free for the reader as well as the author (no publishing charges). Co-lead of DIAMAS, Pierre Mounier explains the importance of lending support to not-for-profit institutional publishing. Besides the diversity offered by such scholar-led, high quality publication outlets, the multilingualism that they represent is key when the dissemination of knowledge and the promotion of citizen science across Europe is taken into account. The Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism in Scholarly Publishing lends verbal support to linguistically diverse scholarly outputs; the EU-funded DIAMAS Project paves the way for stronger and more sustainable infrastructures facilitating them. Since its inception in September 2022, the project will last for 3 years. An ultimate goal of DIAMAS is to help the providers of publishing services raise the quality and visibility of diamond open access by establishing a Europe-wide capacity center. A sister project, CRAFT-OA, focusing on the purely technical aspects of institutional diamond open access publishing begins in January 2023. The preliminary Diamond OA Journals Study (published March 2021), the first ever global survey of diamond open access journals, serves as foundation for both projects. The recording was made in conjunction with the Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing in December 2022. First published online January 10, 2023.

AB  - ABSTRACT Stakeholders from academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishing are increasingly investing in open data partially in the hope that it will democratize science and promote more diverse data reuse. However, fewer studies examine how unconventional communities outside academia and industry use open data. Through an investigative digital ethnography, I observed the data practices of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) skeptics, specifically how they discuss, evaluate, and reuse open data. This poster focuses on the knowledge infrastructure that affords the data practices of ACC skeptics. I argue that ACC skeptics are building a parasitic knowledge infrastructure on the back of the climate science knowledge infrastructure it often seeks to discredit. Understanding the infrastructure that supports skeptics' data reuse can inform how we design policies and infrastructure to actualize open data's promises while minimizing its perils.

AB  - Despite long-standing threats of disruption to scholarly publishing, the community has remained remarkably unchanged over the last two decades. However, underlying this apparent inertia, there is an alternative approach that may emerge over the next few years as known problems move into the foreground, and a number of key social and technical issues are resolved. Furthermore, the industry of science and scientific communication are not isolated from the current economic epoch: collaboration and cost-effectiveness are strong drivers for change. The technological components of this new scholarly universe – natural language processing, semantic technologies such as taxonomies, ontologies and linking – will come together with collaborative innovations inspired by Web 2.0 social media. The final components in recreating a new publishing model are identity and reward, and these are being resolved by the forthcoming Open Research and Contributor ID (ORCID) project and the altmetrics movement respectively.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore dissemination, broadly considered, of an open access (OA) database as part of a librarian‐faculty collaboration currently in progress. Design/methodology/approach Dissemination of an online database by librarians is broadly considered, including metadata optimization for multiple access points and user notification methods. Findings Librarians address OA dissemination challenges by investigating search engine optimization and seeking new opportunities for dissemination on the web. Differences in library metadata formats inhibit metadata optimization and need resolution. Research limitations/implications The collaboration is in progress and many of the ideas and conclusions listed have not been implemented. Practical implications Libraries should consider their role in scholarly publishing, develop workflows to enable it, and extend their efforts to the web. Originality/value This paper contributes to the scant literature on dissemination by libraries, and discusses dissemination challenges encountered by a non‐peer reviewed, dynamic scholarly resource.

As in its previous iterations, the task is to highlight relevant parts in a reference paper, depending on a citance text excerpt from a citing paper. We participated in tasks 1A (citation identification) and 1B (citation context classification). Contrary to most previous works, we frame Task 1A as a search relevance problem, and introduce a 2-step re-ranking approach, which consists of a preselection based on BM25 in addition to positional document features, and a top-k re-ranking with BERT. For Task 1B, we follow previous submissions in applying methods that deal well with low resources and imbalanced classes.

AB  - Abstract The creation of publishing conglomerates and the emergence of purchasing consortia are changing the economic model of scholarly publishing and the process of individual collection management. But will the giants fundamentally change the serials community? Despite the undoubted impact of consolidation, the needs of authors and readers will predominate, and the place of quality control and peer review, though under challenge, will be central to formal scholarly communication. Nevertheless, both publishers and librarians will have to change their traditional cultures and processes, and work in collegial alliances. Size and dominance will be factors impacting the serials community. This paper surveys the likely impact of the giants on the serials community in the next decade: alliances between publishers and other information providers, the continuing importance of quality control and peer review, and the needs of authors and readers. Some informed speculation will challenge the complacency and conservatism of many in the serials community.

AB  - Science policy promotes open access to research data for purposes of transparency and reuse of data in the public interest. We expect demands for open data in scholarly publishing to accelerate, at least partly in response to the opacity of artificial intelligence algorithms. Open data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), and also trustworthy and verifiable. The current state of open data in scholarly publishing is in transition from 'nice to have' to 'need to have.' Research data are valuable, interpretable, and verifiable only in context of their origin, and with sufficient infrastructure to facilitate reuse. Making research data useful is expensive; benefits and costs are distributed unevenly. Open data also poses risks for provenance, intellectual property, misuse, and misappropriation in an era of trolls and hallucinating AI algorithms. Scholars and scholarly publishers must make evidentiary data more widely available to promote public trust in research. To make research processes more trustworthy, transparent, and verifiable, stakeholders need to make greater investments in data stewardship and knowledge infrastructures.

It is anticipated that the role of relatively unstructured, uncontrolled, and informal electronic scholarly communication will be of continued importance, yet will largely remain independent of efforts to create standards and protocols for electronic books, journals, and other transformed traditional media.

AB  - It's been just over a decade since the concept of Open Access (OA) first captured the attention of the scientific and scholarly research community, bringing with it the promise and potential of a shining new digital landscape, in which knowledge is freely shared and freely used, and the pace of scientific discovery is accelerated for the benefit of all.Early meetings, convened by diverse groups of thought leaders around the world, resulted in a handful of key Declarations that provided a strong intellectual and philosophical foundation for the movement, and also reflected the convergence of opportunities that allowed scientists to consider a completely new way of sharing information. As the participants in one such key meeting, the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI), noted in 2002:An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good… [1]The tradition referred to by the BOAI is the longstanding practice of scholars to publish papers in journals without expectation of payment; the new technology is, of course, the Internet. The idea that these two elements could be seamlessly combined to ensure that anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world could have the ability to immediately and freely access the results of scholarly research online ignited a firestorm of excitement in many quarters across the academy.Early supporters of the concept quickly recognized its potential to transform the research process. Not only would it allow them to access tens of thousands of articles that were previously unavailable for them to read, but it would also allow them to use these digital articles in previously unimaginable ways. Rather than being constrained to reading one article at a time, hopping from siloed website to siloed website, scholars could now envision a world where articles could be used in bulk and treated as digital data. They would now have the opportunity to download a significant corpus of the literature, run computational or data mining technologies, and facilitate entirely new ways of using scholarly articles.Scholars also recognized the extraordinary potential that OA held for authors to open up their work to vast new audiences across disciplinary and geographic boundaries, offering the chance to gain new readers and allowing significant and measurable increases in the visibility and impact of their work. This increased access also had significant implications outside of research labs, democratizing the ability of educational institutions to access high-quality information and providing a new channel for businesses, entrepreneurs, and interested members of the public—in many cases, for the first time.In the view of many, OA provided a compelling vision of the future of research communication, and one that was ripe with promise. This spurred some early community declarations of support, including a notable petition sponsored by the Public Library of Science (PLOS) that was signed by more than 30,000 individuals who collectively declared their intent to act in support of OA practices [2].With such a compelling vision and with such clear, tangible benefits serving as drivers, a wholesale move to an OA system should have been easy, no? Not quite—as with any significant movement for change where there are significant societal, ethical, and financial outcomes at stake, there is no such thing as an overnight success.Implementing such wholesale changes in the context of traditional scholarly journal publishing proved to be an extraordinarily challenging venture. A complex set of interwoven factors—from copyright transfer routines that indiscriminately transferred limitations from a paper-based world to the digital environment, to evaluation practices that have intimately tied funding, tenure, and promotion decisions to publication in established flagship “high-end” journals, and not to mention the fact that scholarly publishing is a multibillion dollar revenue-generating industry [3] with absolutely no interest in ceding their claim on this layer of content—came at times to resemble a Gordian knot that at times seemed impossible to unravel.Yet, despite these substantial obstacles, over the past decade, we have seen the acceptance and adoption of OA grow, steadily and inexorably, year in and year out. How has this been possible? It's tempting, when writing a retrospective, to simply point to a person or an event (or set of them) and say: these were the catalysts; this was the precipitating event that made it all happen. And while OA, of course, does have its notable leaders and benchmark events, the collective movement has always been greater than the sum of its parts.This was driven home to me at a recent meeting in Mexico City. Public Knowledge Project founder John Willinsky recounted the experiences he'd had a decade ago, traveling throughout Latin America and working to promote the idea of the academic community taking back control of their research output by using OA. “Sometimes there'd be 15 people in the room, and sometimes a few hundred,” he noted. “But I was so sure that at the end of each discussion, all of them would rush up to me and say, ‘Sign me up! I'm in.’” He recalled his disappointment when, time and time again, that simply didn't happen, and he found himself, as he continued his work over the subsequent years, regularly wondering if anyone was listening at all.Returning to Mexico this year, almost exactly 10 years later, he had his answer: a thriving culture of OA has emerged, with academic and research institutions supporting the creation and publication of several thousand OA journals via platforms like SCIELO and Redalyc, and a thriving network of open digital repositories.As I listened to him speak, it occurred to me that his experience mirrored not only my own but also those of countless others during the last decade. Whether on a campus or in a research lab, in the office of a co-author or a faculty advisor, in a conversation with a policy maker or a research funder, or even just in our own organization with our own colleagues, this simple process of making the case for OA, of planting the seed through education and advocacy, has played out again and again, thousands of times around the world. For me, the story of the last 10 years has truly been the story of these myriad individual actions building one upon another, resulting in a full-fledged global movement making OA the norm in how we share research and scholarship.Over the past decade, the OA movement has both expanded and matured. Although there's certainly no official “Open Access advocate's checklist” that we've been working from to help us measure and mark our progress, a few areas stand out as places where can we truly measure how far we've progressed.

AB  - The engagement of young researchers in the process of scholarly publishing is essential to their career development as well as to advancing science. It signals active involvement with the discourse in a field and contribution to the body of knowledge. Writing and reviewing scientific articles can facilitate a deep understanding of the scientific process and the nuances of effective experimental design as well as the acquirement of appropriate scientific communication skills; notably, these skills are central to the competitiveness and success of young professionals (YPs) in today's and tomorrow's workplace, be it in academia or industry. A number of research studies have explored the benefits of engaging young researchers in scientific publishing. As highlighted in some of these studies, despite the importance of the early exposure of graduate students and young researchers to scientific writing and peer review, relevant activities are often not prioritized within the framework of educational programs, thus leading to the limited development of key skills—critical to the success of YPs across different fields—such as communicating research to a general audience, structuring ideas through effective scientific writing, and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of experimental design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">[1]</xref> . Thus, it is of paramount importance that YPs are aware of the benefits of becoming actively involved in the publication process, both as authors and reviewers, and are also provided—and pursue themselves—relevant opportunities toward augmenting their technical and communication skills, which can prove valuable in their current and future careers. The IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society (AP-S) offers a range of journals, covering the entire spectrum of the antennas and propagation field, that represent excellent opportunities for YPs to advance their career through publishing and reviewing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">[2]</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">[7]</xref> .

There are two core challenges, which should be addressed: 1) ensuring that scientific publications are credible – e.g. that claims are not made without supporting evidence, and that all relevant supporting evidence is provided; and 2) that scientific findings are not misrepresented, distorted or outright misreported when communicated by journalists or the general public. I will present some first steps towards addressing these problems and outline remaining challenges.

AB  - Abstract In the past, scholarly publishing grew in support of college and university needs to support the peer review tenure and promotion system, which itself developed to encourage the learning process through the generation of new knowledge. However, the continuation of this system of scholarly communications is threatened today by internal and external changes in four key areas: research and publishing, technology, government and society, and higher education itself. Electronic information systems hold some promise of enabling a new model for scholarly communication. Yet today we seem to be in the world of Lewis Carroll; scholarly communication had “jam yesterday” and it may have “jam tomorrow,” but scholars and library practitioners are struggling with how to have some “jam today” during a tortuous period of transition. This paper explores some of the causes of the current predicament and provides some modest proposals for collaborating with others in the scholarly, information, and technology communities as we venture through the looking-glass into the future of scholarly communication.

AB  - Although established forms of peer review are often criticized for being slow, secretive, and even unfair, they are repeatedly mentioned by academics as the most important indicator of quality in scholarly publishing. In many countries, the peer review of books is a less codified practice than that of journal articles or conference papers, and the processes and actors involved are far from uniform. In Sweden, the review process of books has seldom been formalized. However, more formal peer review of books has been identified as a response to the increasing importance placed on streamlined peer-reviewed publishing of journal articles in English, which has been described as a direct challenge to more pluralistic publication patterns found particularly in the humanities. In this study, we focus on a novel approach to book review, Kriterium, where an independent portal maintained by academic institutions oversees the reviewing of academic books. The portal administers peer reviews, providing a mark of quality through a process which involves reviewers, an academic coordinator, and an editorial board. The paper studies how this process functions in practice by exploring materials concerning 24 scholarly books reviewed within Kriterium. Our analysis specifically targets tensions identified in the process of reviewing books with a focus on three main themes, namely the intended audience, the edited volume, and the novel role of the academic coordinator. Moreover, we find that the two main aims of the portal-quality enhancement (making research better) and certification (displaying that research is of high quality)-are recurrent in deliberations made in the peer review process. Consequently, we argue that reviewing procedures and criteria of quality are negotiated within a broader discussion where more traditional forms of publishing are challenged by new standards and evaluation practices.

AB  - Academic libraries which are considered to be nerve centers of academic and research activities must help achieve the academic goals of their parent institutions and this is possible only through developing adequate library collection and/or providing seamless and wider access to relevant electronic resources.Chukwu (1998) maintains that the major indicator of a good library is the quality and quantity of its collections.It is necessary for university libraries to acquire current and relevant information resources necessary for sustaining the teaching, learning, and research activities that universities are known for.This paper chiefly investigates the trends in collection development activities in university and college libraries.Further the contemporary changes in scholarly publishing and advances in Information and Communication technologies are posing challenges to library professionals in developing and making them accessible to the end users.This article describes briefly the impact of electronic publishing on collection development in libraries.It also examines the status and management of electronic resources in academic libraries surveyed and enlists the challenges before library professionals in the changed context.It also explores the kind of collaborative initiatives taken up by these libraries and the perceptions of the library professionals on collaborative collection development I.Introduction:Collection development is one of the important and challenging library management activity.Collection development is a process of selecting, ordering and payment of information materials for the use of the users in the library (Olaojo and Akewukekere ,2006).Based on this, collection development helps to enhance the assemblage and provision of a variety of information materials to meet the desperate need of library users.Nnadozie (2006) described collection development as a planned, continuous and cost effective acquisition of quality and relevant materials to meet the needs of the users and objectives of the university libraries.Collection development is concerned with the formulation of a systematic plan to build a library collection which will meet the needs of its users.It encompasses a number of activities related to the development of the library's collection including the determination and coordination of selection policy, assessment of current and potential user needs, collection use studies, collection evaluation, identification of collection needs, selection of materials, planning of resource sharing, collection maintenance and weeding (Gorman and Howes, 1989;Clayton and Gorman, 2001). II. Review of literatureThe review of literature reveals the findings of number of studies on various aspects of collection development.Forecasting the impact of electronic environment and the economic forces on collection development, Harole and Budd (1994) felt that together they create a new environment, where access to collective scholarly resources that no library could be ever afford, supersedes the historic quest for the great comprehensive collection.Ifidon (1997) maintains that library objectives and philosophy must be taken into consideration in collection development, emphasizing that the areas of interest and concerns of library users are paramount.Nwafor (1997) discovered that a low level of funding of university libraries had led to the deterioration in the quality of library collections.Akobo (1998) discovered that problems facing library collections in Nigeria include foreign exchange restrictions, economic recession, and the large population of students.Evans(2000) stressed the need to have a collection development policy in the context of hybrid collections to delineates the purpose and contents of a collection relevant to its users as a whole.Further a well written Collection Development Policy typically identifies subject areas in which it may be preferable to have one format over another (Lee and Wu, 2002).Ononogbo (2003) discovered that 91 percent of the collection in the library being studied was derived from donations, gifts, and bequests.A collection development policy is therefore needed that delineates the purpose and contents of a collection relevant to its users as a whole (Evans, 2000; Futas, 1984)

AB  - product of a highly talented team of undergraduates and graduate students who have come together in the Public Knowledge Project at the University of British Columbia.The principal piece of software, known as Open Journal Systems, has contributed much to my understanding of online journal processes, economics, indexing, and reading, and figures as such in this book.Additionally, this effort to build robust software that improves the quality of access to journals proved an excellent focal point for discussing the possibilities of open access publishing with researchers, editors, librarians, and publishers in many parts of the world.Open Journal Systems has turned out to be more than a talking point and a test bed for the ideas discussed in this book.It has moved beyond the proof-of-concept stage, with the assistance and encouragement of an international open source community, and is now being used to publish open access journals, as well as some subscription journals around the world, with versions now available in seven languages.Given the interest shown in this open source software, a partnership was formed in early 2005 among the Public Knowledge Project, the Canadian Center for Studies in Publishing at Simon Fraser University, and Simon Fraser University Library to oversee the long-term development of Open Journal Systems, Open Conference Systems, and the PKP Harvester.This book, however, is not about the development of publishing software; it is about the age-old question of access to knowledge.In considering what open access has to offer on that question in this book, this is a work of inquiry and advocacy.Its goal is to inform and inspire a larger debate over the political and moral economy of knowledge that will constitute the future of research.It seeks to elevate the questions currently being raised about how research is published, so that they are seen to shine a greater light on our work as scholars and as citizens of a larger world.And at this historic moment, in this transition in journal publishing from print to digital formats, the model of open access publishing challenges not only traditional methods of publishing scholarly work, but the very presence and place of this knowledge in the world.What, then, of the all-too-obvious irony of publishing a book in print and on sale in bookstores about making online research free for the world?I have published and circulated earlier versions of most of these

AB  - During its nearly 100-year history, the Chemistry Library at the University of Chicago and its librarians have responded to changes in the university and in society, including changes in the practice of librarianship, scientific publishing, chemical research, and higher education. A century of discussion about the benefits and shortcomings of departmental libraries has also appeared in the library literature. A review of this literature highlighted a set of issues that influence organizations in their decisions to support departmental libraries or to consolidate these branch libraries into centralized facilities. In the case of the University of Chicago's Chemistry Library, the relative importance of these various issues changed over time, and led to periodic changes in library services, physical facilities, and collection practices. Eventually, the traditional departmental library model gave way to changes in the institution and in scholarly publishing, creating a "tipping point" which led to the current centralization of the collections and services.

AB  - INTRODUCTION This paper explores the variability in self-identifying practices of academic libraries engaged in journal publishing and hosting activities. We were interested in how libraries characterized their efforts in this area and looked at whether there is an unspoken threshold for differentiation with respect to publishing-support naming conventions. METHODS Using the Library Publishing Directory, in-depth interviews, and a more widely circulated follow-up survey, the research team examined service offerings, divisions of responsibility, funding, terminology, and semantic associations within publishing, both as an active practice and as an advertised service. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We aimed to tease out whether there was any sort of tipping point, or inferred rules, around when an institution chose to call the activity either publishing or hosting. We found no particular service, set of services, funding structure, or division of labor that obviously influenced the use of a particular term. Rather than noting a divide between publishing and hosting, participants spoke of both a spectrum and a tiering of work and support, though all emphasized that these models did not describe the quality of the work produced. This paper also discusses how use of the term library publishing creates additional ambiguity in naming practices, and considers some implications for library staff newly immersed in scholarly publishing work.

AB  - As open access to research information grows and publisher business models adapt accordingly, knowledge infrastructure has become the new frontier for advocates of open science. This paper argues that the time has come for universities and other knowledge institutions to assume a larger role in mitigating the risks that arise from ongoing consolidation in research infrastructure, including the privatization of community platforms, commercial control of analytics solutions, and other market-driven trends in scientific and scholarly publishing.

AB  - W hen I was first contemplating this column, and a similar set of comments I made at the ACRL/SPARC Forum at the 2006 ALA Mid winter Meeting in San Antonio, I was tempted to use an extended Lord of the Rings metaphor.In this metaphor, copyright is the Tolkien trilogy's ring-of inestimable value and bestowing great power on its possessor.Lawerence Lessig, of the Creative Commons, is Frodo, with the hopes of many riding on his efforts as he carries the ring to a place where it will be, well, not destroyed, but transformed.Take your pick of any num ber of avaricious publishers to be Gollum, the conflicted character whose spirit has become wellblackened, wily, severe, and tailored to do nothing but covet the precious ring.Conveniently, for our metaphor, Gollum has two warring selves, the one driven by pure greed, and the one who wants to do right by the fellowship made up of faculty (hob bits and "men"), scholarly societies (elves), nonprofit publishers (dwarves), and librarians (wizards), i.e., the ones who want a healthy scholarly communication environment for its own sake.But there is that pesky profi tmoti vated Gollum, too.And the fellowship simply wants the power, including the economic power that comes with the copyright ring, to be balanced in a way that allows knowledge to progress and be made available to future knowledge producers in a "sustainable" way.The fellowship wants a balance so that the pastoral shire of teaching, learning, research, and societal progress fl ourishes, unburdened by constraints on how research is noncom mercially shared and used, or by crippling prices that deny access to the research results for many in the fi rst place.But, in addition to my limitations as a deconstructionist of mid20thcentury fi ction, and despite the possible entertainment value, no metaphor can be extended far enough to fairly characterize the motivations and contri butions of various stakeholders, or to do justice to the complexity of even the small corner of copyright that relates to scholarly publishing.

AB  - The paper aims to explore and identify the recent contributions to the literature available in the current developments and issues in licensing and pricing models in e-resources. An extensive literature survey was performed in an attempt to identify substantial works published to date concerning pricing and licensing issues coupled with the publishers and librarians. The literature review connotes that hardly any systematic study or scholarly output which can facilitate the precise and accurate facts about pricing and licensing issues coupled with the publishers and librarians is available, although the size of the scholarly publishing industry and its effect on the cost and licensing of e-resource is quite large.&nbsp;It is evident from the scrutiny of literature existing that there are still areas for advanced exploration on the topic of pricing and licensing concerns of the scholarly publishing industry; and study paves the way for the concerned organizations and institutions (such as Libraries and Publishers), at global level, to take substantial measures to overcome monopoly effects from the publishers and come up with the standard models. The study is very helpful for librarians or authorities in selecting the best available e-journal package for their libraries .The paper is the first ordered and thorough attempt to review the literature and provide that there is not any standard pricing model available for e-resource subscription in the market to control the monopoly of publishers and aggregators. &nbsp; Key words: Pricing, e-resources, pay per article, big deal, print, publishers, vendors.

AB  - Le systeme de communication scientifique actuel rencontre des difficultes dont sont responsables non seulement les editeurs commerciaux mais aussi les bibliothecaires et les auteurs dans leur course effrenee a la publication. Il existe pourtant des moyens d'ameliorer le systeme en reliant directement l'auteur a la communaute savante, comme le montrent des initiatives telles que Create Change, SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resource Coalition) et les archives de publications prealables. Mais la veritable solution reside dans la reconnaissance, au sein de la communaute des auteurs, de la necessite de proceder differemmment, d'exploiter le Web et de reevaluer la philosophie publier ou perir.

AB  - Science depends on a communication system, and today, that is largely provided by digital technologies such as the internet and web. Despite the fact that digital technologies provide the infrastructure for this communication system, peer-reviewed journals continue to mimic workflows and processes from the print era. This paper focuses on one artifact from the print era, the journal issue, and describes how this artifact has been detrimental to the communication of science, and therefore, to science itself. To replace the journal issue, this paper argues that scholarly publishing and journals could more fully embrace digital technologies by creating digital libraries to present and organize scholarly output.

AB  - The series of annual Munin Conferences was born in 2006. This is a short history of how it happened, and how the conference has developed over the years, step by step, into one of the most important conferences in Europe within its scope. Scholarly publishing is an important part of, and a prerequisite for progress in research. The advent of the Internet has given options for dramatic changes in the process of publishing and the dissemination of research. This has given the Munin Conferences ample issues to debate over the years, and, most likely, the years to come.

AB  - More university presses and academic libraries have started to collaborate in the scholarly publishing field, and it becomes important to investigate how this message of collaboration has been delivered to the academic community, since this community includes both creators and users of scholarly works. This study collects 23 news articles on the collaboration between university presses and academic libraries from the formal news sites of the affiliated institutions and then conducts content analysis on these articles, focusing on their content coverage and purposes. These news articles covered topics including the background and benefits of collaboration, how the collaboration worked/would work, and how libraries and presses can contribute to the collaboration. The analysis reveals that these news articles aim not only to inform their readers about the collaboration, but also to provide rationales to the collaboration. The news articles also demonstrate an unbalanced depiction between press and library by focusing more on the press, and this study interprets this phenomenon as a result of two assumptions held by the news articles: the audience’s unfamiliarity with the press and more challenging financial viability issues the press encountered.

AB  - For decades, universities, researchers, and libraries have sought a systemwide transition of scholarly publishing to open access (OA), but progress has been slow. There is now a potential for more rapid and impactful change, as new collaborative OA publishing models have taken shape. Cooperative publishing arrangements represent a viable path forward for society publishers to transition to OA as the default standard for disseminating research. The traditional article processing charge OA model has introduced sometimes unnavigable financial roadblocks, but cooperative arrangements premised on collective action principles can help to secure long-term stability and prevent the risk of free riding. Investment in cooperative arrangements does not require that cash-strapped libraries discover a new influx of money as their collection budgets continue to shrink, but rather that they purposefully redirect traditional subscription funds toward publishing support. These cooperative arrangements will require a two-way demonstration of trust: On one hand, libraries working together to provide assurances of sustained financial support, and on the other, societies’ willingness to experiment with discarding subscriptions. Organizations such as Society Publishers Coalition and Transitioning Society Publications to Open Access are committed to education about and further development of scalable and cooperative OA publishing models.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to propose a model for running open access academic journals, a model based on a new technology from the sphere of blockchain, smart contracts and cryptoeconomics: token-curated registry (TCR).The authors delineate key issues and bottlenecks of scholarly publishing and peer review process.The principle of operation of the TCR, its advantages and disadvantages, its underlying theoretical setup, is then described.An peer-reviewed journal based on TCR technology is proposed, in which decisions on publishing an articles are made by interested members of the journal's community (as a rule, by authors who published articles in its previous issues) and material incentives are created for the good work of peer reviewers.

AB  - The University Libraries at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) have an active and growing implementation of Open Journal Systems (OJS), a free, open source scholarly publishing platform. But even a free software system is not without its costs, both to the hosting institution and to the creators and staff of individual journals. Institutions that wish to host OJS must be able to install, maintain, and support the product. And while faculty members and other academics are often experts in their content areas, not all of them are prepared to handle other needs associated with creating and publishing an online journal—including decisions that might involve article layout, copyright policies, graphic design, web design, and other technical issues. This article provides an overview of UNCG’s support for OJS, as well as challenges, lessons learned, and future directions related to this service.

AB  - This is a brief report on a pilot project funded by the European Commission TEMPUS programme concerned with the modernisation of the university libraries in Syria and the enhanced visibility of the research outputs of the Syrian academic community. As background, it outlines the current state of the country's electronic and scholarly publishing, and the development of national and university computer networks. It reviews the project's contribution to introduction of automated library management systems with online catalogues and institutional repositories, and the expansion of journal collections. The issues likely to impact on further developments are discussed. Aspects of current professional education, including a shortage of qualified librarians with contemporary professional knowledge and skills, inhibit development. Other major challenges are the lack of effective strategic planning and poor management systems.

AB  - The changing system of scholarly communications and scholarly publishing is exciting for some and unsettling for others. As libraries use their resources and actions to shape the system, they seek to create a system that better reflects their priorities and values. But, at the same time, other stakeholders are also acting in the system. How these various forces will interact over time is unknown, but futures thinking offers an approach to identifying and considering a range of possibilities. This preconference was structured as an experiential workshop, in which participants explored approaches to considering the possible futures of scholarly communications and publishing, and then their implications for access, collections, and preservation. Though no specific conclusions could be reached about “the future” of scholarly communications as the emphasis was on exploring tools and techniques, the workshop enabled participants to think critically and creatively about their organizations, the impact of change and trends, and strategic positioning going forward.

AB  - Over the years since Library Resources and Technical Services began publication in 1957, many fine papers have appeared in the journal. From time to time, we will republish an important paper that contributed in a significant way to the theory of the field or that identified and addressed a unique problem. These papers will be published with a new introduction that revisits the themes of the original paper Acquisitions Librarian as Change Agent in the Transition to the Electronic Library, by Ross Atkinson, first appeared in 1992 (36, no. 1 [January 1992]: 7-20). This essay received the Best of LRTS Award for papers published in 1992. In it, Atkinson investigated the role of the librarian in handling new technology and proposed new functions and relationships for within the library. We have asked Atkinson to reconsider the ideas he explored in his original paper His new introduction proceeds the award-winning essay. --Editor The premise of this paper on the acquisitions librarian as change agent, originally presented in 1991, was that acquisitions, of all the major library functions, was arguably the least prepared for the transition to a primarily digital information environment. At the same time, however--so the argument went--acquisitions was uniquely positioned, because of its specialized business skills and experience, to lead the way in what we would later call reappropriation, that is, the academy's resumption of the responsibility for the publication or distribution of some or all of the scholarly information it produces. (Today, in the era of SPARC [Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition], High Wire Press, Project Muse, Project Euclid, E-Scholarship--just to name a few--the view that information services has a responsibility for the entire process of information exchange from the writer to the reader is self-evident; twelve years ago, however, it was still a relatively vague abstraction.) The paper suggested, therefore, that should make preparations to abandon its traditional operation and to assume a new role in the library and the academy as publication facilitator. I feel that someone else wrote this paper--because I was someone else in 1991--and I infer now that the person who wrote it was making three implicit assumptions: * Most scholarly publications would shift online relatively soon (the floodgates will open)--certainly well before the end of the 1990s. * In such a primarily online environment, the traditional function of would become increasingly superfluous. Only an accountant would really be needed, to pay the bills. * The whole process of scholarly communication, especially those areas that were dominated by commercial science publishers, was defective--and would likely collapse, sooner or later, of its own weight. It was important that the library be prepared, therefore, with alternative methods that scholars would be able to use to exchange information effectively. All three of these assumptions have obviously turned out to be entirely mistaken. While the writer of the paper acknowledged the conservative nature of the academy, he totally overestimated the speed with which the academic community would move to electronic publishing. I am sure he would have been shocked in 1991 to learn that over 80 percent of Cornell's materials budget in 2003 was still being spent on traditional materials. He would probably have been somewhat less surprised, although certainly disappointed, to learn that the real leadership in the transition to electronic scholarly publishing has been provided (admittedly with some notable exceptions) by commercial journal publishers--and that they have brilliantly contrived new methods (licensing, bundling) to increase their revenues in the online environment beyond even what they had managed to achieve in the era of print publishing. One (admittedly obvious) expectation in the paper that certainly has turned out to be true is that books would move much more slowly online than journals. …

AB  - The creation and dissemination of reproducible research is receiving ever-growing attention in discussions on best practices in publication and education. A key element of these practices is appropriate citation of data sources. In this presentation we describe one scholar-led initiative to increase awareness of the value of data citation in scholarly communication across the discipline of linguistics. &#x0D; Practices in linguistics are varied; it is primarily a data-driven social science, in which inferences about the properties of language, human cognition, cultures and societies are drawn from observations of language. The primary data sets underlying the field are records of these observations in the form of, for instance, texts, audio/video recordings and annotations. While linguists have always relied on language data, they have not always facilitated access to those data in publications (Berez-Kroeker et al. 2018). A great deal of published linguistic research is therefore not reproducible, either in principle or in practice.&#x0D; A primary factor hindering reproducible research in linguistics is the lack of standards for data citation in scholarly publishing. Lacking such standards, the field continues to emphasize linguistic analyses over linguistic data, and as a result, linguists have little incentive to make the data behind research publications accessible.&#x0D; Funded by the US National Science Foundation, since 2015 we have endeavored to develop and promote standards for citing data. We are an international (Norway, US, Canada, Australia) team of scholars including linguistic data practitioners, scholarly communication librarians, and digital archivists.&#x0D; In this presentation we discuss our coordinated efforts over the past four years, including:&#x0D; Network building&#x0D; &#x0D; 3 international workshops to identify technical and sociological barriers to research data citation in linguistics publications;&#x0D; The formation of the Linguistics Data Interest Group (https://rd-alliance.org/groups/linguistics-data-ig) within the Research Data Alliance, with nearly 100 members from the international linguistics scholarly community.&#x0D; &#x0D; Outreach activities&#x0D; &#x0D; Short-form technical courses and presentations offered through the Linguistic Society of America.&#x0D; &#x0D; Deliverable products&#x0D; &#x0D; An open-access position paper (Berez-Kroeker et al. 2018).&#x0D; The Austin Principles of Data Citation in Linguistics (http://linguisticsdatacitation.org), which annotates the FORCE11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (Data Citation Synthesis Group 2014) for linguistic scholarship.&#x0D; Guidelines for citing linguistic data to be shared in late 2019 with linguistics journal editors and stylesheet curators.&#x0D; The open-access Open Handbook of Linguistic Data Management (MIT Press Open, est. publication date 2020). &#x0D; &#x0D; With this presentation, we aim to encourage practitioners in other fields to initiate similar advancements, and to encourage decision-makers and publishers to actively collaborate with and support scholar-led initiatives working toward better research practices.

Among the Scholarly Kitchen’s many designated “chefs” (i.e., regular writers) are Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe and Roger Schonfeld, both of whom possess a uniquely comprehensive, global perspective spanning the fields of scholarly publishing, scientific research, communication, academic libraries, and higher education. As joint plenary speakers at the 2022 CSE Annual Meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, Hinchliffe and Schonfeld shared their insights and observations about several recent trends and trajectories they’ve identified in the scholarly publishing industry. Hinchliffe began the tandem talk by framing it within the concept of future thinking—the goal of which is not necessarily to predict the future, but rather to engage in strategic dialogue and raise informed, enterprising questions that will serve to sculpt the world in which we eventually live. Doing so, she said, illuminates the policies and strategies that factor into a desirable future, with the caveat that a desirable future for one party may be unappealing to another. In […]

AB  - This article summarizes the results of a short survey completed by 94 publishers, librarians and suppliers within the international scholarly publishing community in early 2017. From a selection of 13 categories included as a multi-choice pick-list, each with additional sub-categories – a total of 57 options – the participants identified the functions they are currently outsourcing and provided a forecast of those they are considering outsourcing in the future. The survey found the top sub-category function currently outsourced across all three stakeholder groups to be ‘Content hosting/technology platform’ (one of seven sub-categories associated under the parent category 6: ‘IT – Hosting/content’), which was selected by a total of 18 survey respondents. The survey provided new insights into the issue of outsourcing in the scholarly communications field, and the author invites further participation to build on these initial findings.

AB  - Academic Library Workers in Conversation is a bimonthly C&amp;RL News series focused on elevating the everyday conversations of library professionals. The wisdom of the watercooler has long been heralded, but this series hopes to go further by minimizing barriers to traditional publishing with an accessible format. Each of the topics in the series were proposed by the authors and they were given space to explore. We encourage you to follow and share these conversations about transforming libraries with ideas from the frontlines. This issue’s conversation addresses discrimination in scholarly publishing and makes it clear that we have not arrived, wherever we are. —Dustin Fife, series editor

AB  - There are at least two dimensions to the transformation in the character of scholarly publishing and the correlative shift in the networked conditions of production of scholarly work.The scope and scale of material available has radically increased and the mechanisms of judging scholarly value have been increasingly refined.Yet, we have not done enough to critically reflect on what these transformations have done to the experience of producing scholarly work.I am referring to the simple way that everyday activities of scholarship have been transformed.An obvious example is the practice of carrying out a literature review.This brief essay presents some notes on literature review preparation and abstract writing from the perspective of a mid-career academic who is committed to assisting their research students.It then argues there are two new meta-professional skills required of scholars to function in academia and in which our research students need to develop expertise.What if we could problematise the 'project' (or 'projectify' the problem)?Rather than the coordinates of the project being determined by the administrative burden of measurement and correlative productivity according to maximum gradients of anxiety (the neoliberal academic model), what if the 'project' was configured as an instrument for suspending practices of discovery according to the maximum gradients of curiosity (the post-neoliberal academic model)?This is the difference between passive and active affections that befall scholars as they are socialised as academics.

AB  - Research data sharing has become an expected component of scientific research and scholarly publishing practice over the last few decades, due in part to requirements for federally funded research. As part of a larger effort to better understand the workflows and costs of public access to research data, this project conducted a high-level analysis of where academic research data is most frequently shared. To do this, we leveraged the DataCite and Crossref application programming interfaces (APIs) in search of Publisher field elements demonstrating which data repositories were utilized by researchers from six academic research institutions between 2012–2022. In addition, we also ran a preliminary analysis of the quality of the metadata associated with these published datasets, comparing the extent to which information was missing from metadata fields deemed important for public access to research data. Results show that the top 10 publishers accounted for 89.0% to 99.8% of the datasets connected with the institutions in our study. Known data repositories, including institutional data repositories hosted by those institutions, were initially lacking from our sample due to varying metadata standards and practices. We conclude that the metadata quality landscape for published research datasets is uneven; key information, such as author affiliation, is often incomplete or missing from source data repositories and aggregators. To enhance the findability, interoperability, accessibility, and reusability (FAIRness) of research data, we provide a set of concrete recommendations that repositories and data authors can take to improve scholarly metadata associated with shared datasets.

AB  - A discussion on SPARC Europe's report Opening Knowledge: Retaining Rights and Open Licensing in Europe (made public via Zenodo, 28 June 2023). Three of the authors of the report share their thoughts on why the landscape differs so much between countries. Questions include why so many institutions in the United Kingdom and Norway stand out as early adopters, whereas other countries have yet to start implementing Rights Retention Policies, be it a national or institutional level. Various outreach and dissemination activities are on-going, and there appears to be promising developments in several European countries that might radically change the landscape for open licensing and self-archiving across Europe, thereby speeding up the transformation towards full open access to the scholarly record. The recording was made in conjunction with the 18th Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing in Tromsø, November 2023. First published online: January 23, 2024.

AB  - The title of this book might lead you to believe that it is a “how-to” for librarians who are just starting their professional careers. It is not. The book offers something for everyone—even those librarians who are not at all interested in making a career change. Jump-Start Your Career as a Digital Librarian is a compilation of twelve chapters written by professional librarians.The book is organized into two parts: “Part 1: Planning Your Career” and “Part 2: Practicing Your Career.” Part 1 defines digital librarianship and describes the work of digital librarians. It goes on to offer practical advice on how to get a new career in digital librarianship off to a good a start. The chapter, “Getting the Most out of Library School,” provides guidance for students who intend to work in the field of digital librarianship. The author advises potential digital librarians that they may need to design their own program of study in library school and points out the importance of networking, both in person and virtually, and staying abreast of technology. “Landing Your First Job” reinforces time-honored advice on what to expect in the search for a job. For practicing librarians, chapter 4 addresses “Making a Career Shift.” Monson identifies skills from traditional librarian specialties (technical services, archives, reference/instruction, access) that transfer to digital librarianship. Chapter 5, “Furthering Your Career,” provides information for librarians who are not planning on changing their career, but who want to upgrade their skills or broaden their horizons with strategies such as seeking a mentor, joining professional organizations, or pursuing continuing education.The chapters in part 2 are not so specifically targeted. The content in these chapters is more technical in nature with titles that run along the lines of “Understanding Key Technology Concepts,” “Learning about Metadata,” and “Putting Metadata into Practice.” The author covers topics from the effects of digital librarianship on scholarly publishing to the preservation of digital content. She gives readers a view of the working environment of digital librarianship with a sampling of the discipline's need-to-know terms and the dynamics of collaborating with a group involved in a digital project. The information in these chapters is beneficial to the library school student who is planning on following the digital librarianship career path and practicing librarians who might not have been exposed to the world of digital librarianship when they were in library school.Jump-Start Your Career as a Digital Librarian is easy to read. Each chapter includes references, recommended resources, and a feature that I really like, a “Final Thoughts” section to wrap up the theme of the chapter. The book includes a glossary and an index. While this book does not have clinical value and is not one that would be included in a medical library collection, I highly recommend it for any librarian who wants to become familiar with the basic concepts of the field of digital librarianship.

AB  - Sci-Hub has been referred to as the "Robin Hood" of science, but in reality, it is not. Sci-Hub is a disruption to the entire scholarly publishing research cycle. Over the last three years, the amount of licensed e-content that has been illegally obtained by Sci-Hub has grown significantly. This content has been acquired through stolen institutional staff and student credentials. Acquiring and misappropriating these credentials creates serious risks for an institution's systems and users as well as publishers. What can libraries and publishers do to minimize or eliminate these infractions? This discussion about the collective efforts of publishers, libraries, and other organizations will cover how to protect electronic resources, personal data, and adopting best practices in order to better defend from cyberattacks that compromise our organizations. We will discuss how these attacks can occur and steps you can take to protect your library. While, unfortunately, there is no one single solution for this problem, we will also look at a case study of a library that successfully implemented some of these practices to combat the cyberattacks. Through this we will demonstrate that together we can reduce the risks facing researchers, librarians, and publishers created by Sci-Hub.

AB  - Abstract Open Access Engineering Journal PublishingThe scholarly publishing landscape is shifting. The emergence of open access, content that isonline and freely accessible, is challenging the traditional subscription publishing model. It isestimated that global open access journal publishing is now 12% overall. This study examinesopen access journal publishing within engineering to quantify and identify sources. Anunderstanding of current open access publishing within engineering can support scholarlycommunication initiatives and outreach efforts (e.g., finding faculty champions, promotion ofspecific venues, and determining financial funding levels). Using Web of Science, journalarticles within the 14 engineering Web of Science Categories were identified. The articles werecategorized based on open access, subject, author affiliation, and source title. Approximately 4%of the engineering journal articles within those 14 categories are open access, but limiting toinclude at least one U.S. author or coauthor decreased the number of open access articles to 1%.Comparisons were made between overall open access journal article publishing at the top 25 U.Sengineering schools and the percentage of open access engineering journal articles at thoseinstitutions. Despite overall open access publishing at the top 25 U.S. engineering schoolsapproaching the overall global open access journal publishing level (approximately 8%), openaccess engineering journal publishing is considerably less. A list of the most frequent openaccess engineering journal venues for the engineering schools is presented. The paper concludeswith a local study involving open access journal publishing within three engineering departmentsat a large research university, which reveals several interesting open access publishing patterns.

AB  - <p class="first" id="d19351620e56">Currently, individual publishers, librarians, scholarly publishing platforms and services encounter challenges when collecting the OA book usage data to make strategic decisions about their OA publishing and OA programs. Staff time and expertise is required to normalize and aggregate these impact metrics from numerous platforms. Without such high-quality, reliable data available, organizations cannot be fully aware of the context-specific impacts related to a given author, collection, institution or platform. Additionally, smaller organizations often lack the resources to process incoming usage data and benefit from such OA impact analytics. To address this disparity, stakeholders have been advancing the Open Access Book Usage Data Trust effort (OAeBUDT) with support from the Mellon Foundation. This international network is working towards exchanging reliable usage data in a trusted, equitable, and community-governed way. By 2025, the effort aims to foster the secure, multi-party exchange, aggregation and benchmarking of book usage related data; increase trust in usage metrics; improve data quality; and reduce OA reporting and compliance resource-burdens. In 2023, the project is developing ethical data use guidelines to inform OA book usage data sharing agreements and technical requirements for data exchange between public and commercial OA book usage data creators. This poster will provide background to the OAeBUDT effort, summarizing key research findings to date while providing a preview of the emerging ethical data exchange and use guidelines. QR codes will be available for individuals to participate in open community consultations and download resources for later reference.

AB  - Background. Attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the "citation benefit". Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results. Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9% (95% confidence interval: 5% to 13%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30%. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion. After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.

AB  - Research or production of knowledge is at once an intensely personal and social activity. The quest for exploring unknown territories – the loneliness of a long-distance runner – is the personal aspect. But aggregation and advancement of knowledge takes place by collective efforts of researchers around the world. In the production of new knowledge scientists use what is already known. That pattern is why we need huge – and expensive – libraries. Moreover, generation of knowledge is only one part of the research process. For knowledge to be useful, it should be shared with other researchers and communicated, in a suitable format, to different users/stakeholders. Scientists in developing countries are terribly handicapped in both generation and sharing. Even when both information and communication were entirely mediated by the printed word, there was a big gap between the richer and poorer countries that increased with the passage of time. For example, in the 1920s, 30s and 40s, India did rather well in science. It was then that men of the calibre of Srinivasa Ramanujan ("the man who knew infinity," as the award-winning book by Robert Kanigel referred to him), C. V. Raman (India's first Nobelist in science), Meghanad Saha (known for his work on thermal ionization) and Jagdish Chandra Bose (who many believe was ahead of Marconi in recognizing the existence of radio waves) performed their world class work. In those days, there were very few journals. The journals, most of them published in the West, took a few months to arrive in India by sea, and to that extent Indian scientists were behind their Western counterparts in the matter of access to information. In contrast by the 1960s and 70s, there were approximately 50,000 research journals and many libraries in India could subscribe at best only to a few hundreds. Also, for some reason, interlibrary lending never did pick up in India (and most other parts of the developing world). The net result was that scientists in developing countries suffered a great deal of relative disadvantage compared to their Western counterparts. Today many institutions in developing countries cannot afford to maintain good libraries. Most libraries in sub-Saharan Africa have not subscribed to any journal for years. "If scientists in many African universities often have to rely on what they are told by newspapers, by friends or Time magazine, how can they ever compete with scientists in USA and Western Europe when there is such a vast difference in their ability to access information, either through print media or electronically?" asks Seun Ogunseitan, the Nigerian journalist-turned-information provider. Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, the best-funded library among all Indian institutions of higher education, has an annual library budget of approximately Rs 90 million (about $1.8 million). Only a handful of Indian libraries have a budget of around Rs 10 million (about $200,000) – peanuts compared to the acquisition budgets of even moderate university libraries in the United States. Even in the West, universities and research institutions are facing a major serials crisis. The cost of journals is escalating at a rate much higher than the general inflation rate. The last few years have witnessed the emergence of many initiatives to meet it, and some of them are eminently advantageous to scientists and scholars in the developing world. We will look at them in a moment. If escalating costs of print journals has made life miserable for scientists in developing countries in particular, and scholars in social sciences and humanities, the advent of electronic sources of information has made the situation even worse. It is in the nature of any new technology to exacerbate the existing divide between the rich and the poor. The newer and more potent the technology, the greater its ability to increase the inequalities. The rapid changes that are taking place in the ways new information is published, stored, disseminated and retrieved using the rapidly advancing information and communication technologies have exacerbated the relative deprivation suffered by researchers in the developing world. The new information and communication technologies (ICTs) have not just made each operation faster, but have brought about a greater synergy between these operations in ways unthinkable in the earlier era mediated by print on paper. Furthermore, when many journals started publishing electronic versions they started accepting manuscripts electronically and got the papers reviewed electronically. Many developing country scientists, who did not have access to personal computers, e-mail and the Internet, could neither submit their papers to these journals nor read them or act as referees. The irony is that one does not receive papers to referee not because he is not considered good enough, but because he is not connected by the right technology! Let me give one more example – how lack of access to the right kind of technology can jeopardize one's chances for participation in research programs. More R&D collaborations are developing with Internet-facilitated innovations such as virtual research laboratories and the simultaneous use of distributed virtual data banks by researchers around the globe, and grids, which depend in a fundamental way on access to high bandwidth networks. Most researchers in developing countries, even those who are eminently qualified to take part in such collaboration, are excluded simply because they do not have access to the right technology. Thus the new ICTs, left to their own devices, will surely widen the knowledge divide or the disparities in people's capacities to do research and their ability to use them to their advantage. Thanks to men like Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, we have abolished apartheid based on skin color, but we are letting the new ICTs create a new kind of apartheid based on information access. Inadequate access to literature or information is not the only problem facing scientists in developing countries. An equally important problem is that research carried out in developing countries lacks visibility. Nobody notices it. Nobody quotes it. The same is true for most journals published in developing countries. Very few papers published from developing countries become citation classics or find a place in the list of key papers in an emerging research front. After years of doing research under rather difficult conditions, one still finds oneself in the category of also-rans. Clearly, the advent and rapid development of the new information and communication technologies have not really helped scientific research in the developing countries. The Internet access gap between the rich and the poor areas of the world is not only large, but growing, according to the (U.S.) National Science Foundation's Science and Engineering Indicators 2002 . In 1997, Internet host penetration rates in North America were 267 times greater than rates in Africa; by October 2000, the gap had grown to a multiple of 540. History has shown us that any technology will exacerbate the existing divides. And ICTs have exacerbated the existing inequalities in the world of science in such a short time. But, in my opinion, one does not have to lose hope. As demonstrated by the award-winning Information Village project of the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation in India, if intelligently and innovatively used, the very same information and communication technologies can become allies in our efforts to bridge the divides (Arunachalam, S. 2002. Reaching the unreached: How can we use ICTs to empower the rural poor in the developing world through enhanced access to relevant information? IFLA General Conference, Glasgow, 18-24 August 2002. http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla68/prog02.htm). Let us see how. The past few years have witnessed several developments that could make access to information for scientists in the developing world a lot more affordable. These include initiatives promoted by scientists, libraries, publishers, academies and societies. Brief descriptions of a few of them follow. Public Library of Science ( http://www.publiclibraryofscience.org) The Public Library of Science, a grassroots initiative by scientists, is a non-profit organization of scientists committed to making the world's scientific and medical literature freely accessible to scientists and to the public around the world for the benefit of scientific progress, education and the public good. The aim is to establish international online public libraries of science that will archive and distribute the complete contents of published scientific articles and foster the development of new ways to search, interlink and integrate information. As a step toward these goals, scientists around the world have been circulating an open letter urging publishers to allow the research reports that have appeared in their journals to be distributed freely by independent, online public libraries of science. More than 30,000 people from 177 countries have signed the open letter, as of June 15, 2002. This initiative has prompted some significant and welcome steps by many scientific publishers toward freer access to published research, but in general these steps have fallen short of expectations of the proponents of this idea. Scientists everywhere, and especially in developing countries, should make every effort to publish their work in, and give their full support to, those journals that have adopted the policy proposed in the open letter. The Public Library of Science also plans to launch online journals that will publish original work in the public domain. The costs will be recovered primarily by charges to authors, which are expected to be approximately $300 per published article. Costs will be subsidized for authors from developing countries who cannot afford these charges. International Scholarly Communications Alliance ( http://www.curl.ac.uk/about/isca.html) A new international scholarly communications alliance formed by eight of the world's principal research library organizations in February 2002 will broaden access to research and facilitate transformation of knowledge dissemination. ISCA members – about 600 research libraries worldwide – are working together to support equitable access to scholarly literature and to take united action to create appropriate policies. The action-oriented global network will concentrate on ways to ensure open and affordable access to scholarship across national boundaries. ISCA will engage in a series of activities that focus the scholarly publishing process on the primary goals of the academic research community, advancing the discovery of new knowledge and facilitating its dissemination. Through sharing expertise on scholarly communications issues, these member organizations, whose total library budgets equal over US $5 billion and which serve well over 11 million students and faculty, will be prepared to act as a unified body in creating policies and taking actions that advance these goals. Larger libraries in developing countries will do well to coordinate their policies with ISCA. As a body, ISCA will promote solutions which its members agree are necessary, practical and viable approaches. Among the current advocacy programs are SPARC and the Open Archives initiative. SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, www.sparc.org) is an ARL-initiated effort to facilitate competition in scientific communication through the creation of high-quality low-cost alternatives to expensive commercial titles, and SPARC Europe, recently launched to provide a European operational arm for SPARC activities. SPARC emerged from the widespread perception that in scientific communication the researchers and the laboratories – where scientific communication originates – have been forgotten or sidelined and the profit motive of commercial publishers has taken over. SPARC's avowed aim is to restore the researcher in research publishing. SPARC persuades editors and editorial board members of unduly expensive commercial journals to come out and start new journals of high quality. SPARC journals have become popular within a few years of their first publication. Developing country scientists should submit their work to SPARC journals rather than to the expensive journals they are trying to replace. Open Archives Initiative (OAI) ( http://www.openarchives.org) develops and promotes interoperability standards to facilitate the efficient dissemination of content. Supported by the Digital Library Federation, Coalition for Networked Information and National Science Foundation, the OAI has its roots in an effort to enhance access to e-print archives as a means of increasing the availability of scholarly communication. The fundamental technological framework and standards that are developing to support this work promise to have much broader relevance in opening up access to a range of digital materials. The full-text physics archive, arXive, founded by Paul Ginsparg at Los Alamos in 1991, is probably the oldest and the most prominent subject-specific e-print server. With more than 15 mirror sites around the world this automated electronic archive covers research papers in physics, mathematics, nonlinear sciences, computational linguistics and neuroscience. arXive contains about 140,000 free full-text research papers, of which about half are in astrophysics and high energy physics. This pioneering effort is easily one of the most innovative and successful experiments to-date in scholarly communication. Among other examples of successful and varied archive efforts are the SPIRES HEP literature database; the Digital Library for Physics, Astrophysics and Instrumentations ( http://adswww.Harvard.edu ); Research Index or Cite Seer (computer science); Cogprints (cognitive science); Clinmed (clinmednetprints.org); RePEc (economics); and CoRR (computing). Electronic e-prints do not aim merely to capture the articles; they are far more than simple electronic reproductions of what would appear in print journals. E-print publication on the Web offers numerous value-added elements, such as multimedia and data sets, as well as contextual links to other documents referred to in a paper and to databases. Indeed, digital libraries, commercial aggregators of journals and secondary service providers such as ISI and Chemical Abstracts Service, are exploiting the document linking advantage. In the very near future, the print versions of journals will not be the true archivers. The e-print archives, as both the data and the access systems can be mirrored in several locations around the world, offer built-in insurance against possible loss of archived material due to unforeseen calamities (such as natural disasters or system failures at any one location). For some reason, e-print archives in fields other than physics and computer science are not growing fast enough despite some well-meaning efforts. Stevan Harnad of the University of Southampton says the reason is that disciplines are not the right agent for change. "The right entity for all of this is the university," says Harnad, an outspoken proponent of open access to scientific literature. According to him, universities have an economic incentive to try to reduce the cost of scientific publishing. A number of leading American universities are creating and maintaining institutional archives. These include the Dspace initiative of MIT, the OSU Knowledge Bank of Ohio State University, the Scholarship Repository of the University of California system and Caltech's institutional repository. Developing country scientists should use the existing archives to disseminate their work as well as to learn about the work of others. They may also establish institutional archives and national level e-print servers, especially in fields such as agriculture and health sciences. Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, has just initiated its institutional e-prints archive. PubMed Central ( http://www.pubmedcentral.gov) is a digital archive of life sciences journal literature, developed and managed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). With PubMed Central, NCBI is taking the lead in preserving and maintaining open access to the electronic literature, just as NLM has done for decades with the printed biomedical literature. PubMed Central aims to fill the role of a world-class library in the digital age. It is not, and has no intention of becoming, a journal publisher. Access to PubMed Central is free and unrestricted. The value of PubMed Central, in addition to its role as an archive, lies in what can be done when data from diverse sources is stored in a common format in a single repository. You get more rapid searching, manipulation and cross-linking of the complete collection and all the benefits that derive from that. Many journals already have online publishing operations, and there is a growing tendency to publish material online only, to the exclusion of print. This literature must be preserved in a form that ensures open access to it over the longer term. This is what NCBI has undertaken to do. Scientists from developing countries should encourage all journals to join such efforts. A number of journals and archives are now available free on the Web. The Association of Research Libraries has published a Directory of Electronic Journals, which lists several hundred titles that provide free access. The Open Society Institute (Soros Foundation, http://www.soros.org/openaccess ), founded by the millionaire George Soros, has issued a statement advocating open access and has provided $3 million over three years for projects supporting alternative journals and open archiving initiatives. The African Virtual University is a "university without walls" that uses modern ICTs to give institutions in sub-Saharan Africa direct access to some high quality learning resources. It provides students and professionals in 17 countries free e-mail accounts and access to an online digital library with over 1,000 full-text journals. Non-Profit Initiatives There are a few non-profit publishers/distributors of developing country journals and information. These include Bioline International (http://www.bioline.org.br), which hosts electronic versions of many developing country journals (most of them at a modest subscription fee); International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications, or INASP (www.inasp.info/index.html), a co-operative network of partners whose mission is to enhance the flow of information within and between countries, especially those with less developed systems of publication and dissemination; SciELO (www.scielo.org), which hosts more than 80 journals published in Latin American countries, such as Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Cuba, and Spain; and African Journals Online or AJOL (www.inasp.info/ajol/index.html), which provides free online access to titles and abstracts of more than 60 African journals and full text on request. HINARI (Health Internet, http://www.healthinternetwork.org), a UN/WHO initiative, aims to provide commercial medical journals free to licensed countries in the developing world. PERI (Programme for the Enhancement of Research Information, http://www.inasp.info/peri/index.html), promoted by the INASP, supports information production, access and dissemination for research partners in developing and transitional countries utilizing information and communication technologies. The Electronic Publishing Trust for Development (EPT), established in 1996, facilitates open access to the world's scholarly literature and the electronic publication of bioscience journals from countries experiencing difficulties with traditional publication. The main activities of EPT are to provide awareness of the benefits of electronic publishing, transfer e-publishing technology through training and online resources, provide management and distribution support, and support open access initiatives and make them known to developing country scientists and publishers. What we want to achieve is to make scientific and technical information flow freely and be accessible at affordable costs to researchers and students everywhere in the world – a kind of enlightened socialism for scientific knowledge. To be honest, this can only be an ideal – the direction in which we should move. Achieving this goal would necessarily mean exploring many possibilities. First, we should try to facilitate access to all the content (scientific and technical journal papers, reports, theses, conference papers, bibliographic, factual and full-text information, etc.); second, we should ensure all potential users of this content have access to the technological tools to access it (such as high bandwidth Internet connection); third, we should continue with our efforts to evolve standards and norms, including research into better ways of doing things, that will enhance the ease of use and value of the content; fourth we should build organizational structures that would ensure the long-term survival of the entire system. As we saw in the previous section, there have been many efforts to enhance free and low-cost access to content of different kinds. A number of journals are available for free access a few months after publication. Many high-impact journals are given such delayed access by High Wire Press of Stanford University. Parts of certain journals, such as The Economist and The New Scientist, are available free on the Web. Scientists in developing countries and organizations that care for their welfare such as the Third World Academy of Science and the Inter Academy Panel should bring pressure on publishers to make electronic access to their journals free or at least make them freely available a few months after publication. They should support the Public Library of Science movement. Unfortunately, established publishers would not like to lose their stranglehold on the scholarly journals market and would try to scuttle the open source movement. For example Ingenta, a leading for-profit aggregator of electronic journals, has roped in half-a-dozen champions of the open source movement to be on their advisory board. A few months ago the Director General of WHO, Gro Harlem Brundtland, and the editor of BMJ, Richard Smith, negotiated a deal with leading publishers of biomedical journals, to make their journals freely accessible to public institutions, universities and hospitals in more than 100 developing countries. The main criterion for selection of countries was per capita GDP of less than $1,000. But the publishers did not extend the benefit to several countries that met this criterion (e.g., India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), on the grounds that they already have many subscribers in those countries and they would lose business. In essence, they are willing to give free access to their journals to countries where there are hardly any users – a case of having their cake and eating it, too. WHO should renegotiate the terms and enable all developing countries to gain free access to these journals. Organizations such as the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and ISNAR may take the lead for working out similar arrangements for developing country institutions to gain free access to agricultural (and related) journals. The Inter Academy Panel (IAP), formed by over 80 science academies of the world, can lend its support to such a move. It is not just the commercial publishers who are making it difficult for developing country scientists to gain free access to information. Even some society publishers are unwilling to throw open access to their journals, largely because subscription to their journals is their major source of income. Nor do they always require scientists affiliated with commercial firms to deposit their data in a public database such as GenBank, thus sacrificing the interest of public good at the altar of commercial interests. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a model for other societies and academies. Not only the Academy's Proceedings but also its entire collection of over 2,000 reports are available free on the Web to developing country users. Indeed, Bruce Alberts, NAS president, is a great champion of the cause of science and technology in developing countries. He played an important role in founding the Inter Academy Panel and the Inter Academy Council. Alberts suggested the following two-part strategy in his presidential address to the Fellows at the NAS 136th Annual Meeting in April 1999: Connect all scientists to the World Wide Web, by providing subsidized Internet access through commercial satellite networks; Take responsibility for generating a rich array of scientifically validated knowledge resources, made available free on the Web, in preparation for a time when universal Internet access for scientists is achieved in both developing and industrialized nations. Both of these are excellent suggestions. Not only do we need useful content to be available free on the Web, but we also need the technology in place to take advantage of the content. A concerted effort should be mounted to persuade philanthropic foundations and donor agencies concerned with higher education and research to donate funds to make available PCs and high bandwidth Internet connections to researchers and libraries in developing countries. The concerned governments should make things easy for the spread of ICTs among university and research institutions, although such installation is easier said than done. There is a great need for building awareness among Third World researchers and research managers about such tools as electronic journals and open archives and the benefits of networking. Open access evangelists like Steve Harnad should address scientists and scholars in important centers of research in the Third World. A reader on the advantages of going electronic and current developments must be produced and circulated widely. Librarians in the Third World should be given special training to play their role of information intermediaries in the changed circumstances. In short, the transition from print-based access to electronic information access in the Third World should be facilitated by lectures, workshops, training programs and hands on experience as well as through provision of the technical backup. While agencies such as EPT and INASP can help with the training programs, organizations such as IAP, IAC and NAS can persuade the scientific communities and the governments in the Third World to overcome any inertia or barriers to the transition. Donor agencies such as IDRC and the Soros Foundation can make the necessary investments to make the transition happen soon. If all this can happen, then access to information for research will truly become democratic and the divide between the rich and the poor would be considerably reduced.

AB  - This paper addresses the integration of a Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) service within a group of open access (OA) publishing digital platforms and considers its potential impact on both research and scholarly publishing. The software powering this service, called entity-fishing, was initially developed by Inria in the context of the EU FP7 project CENDARI and provides automatic entity recognition and disambiguation using the Wikipedia and Wikidata data sets. The application is distributed with an open-source licence, and it has been deployed as a web service in DARIAH's infrastructure hosted by the French HumaNum. In the paper, we focus on the specific issues related to its integration on five OA platforms specialized in the publication of scholarly monographs in the social sciences and humanities (SSH), as part of the work carried out within the EU H2020 project HIRMEOS (High Integration of Research Monographs in the European Open Science infrastructure). In the first section, we give a brief overview of the current status and evolution of OA publications, considering specifically the challenges that OA monographs are encountering. In the second part, we show how the HIRMEOS project aims to face these challenges by optimizing five OA digital platforms for the publication of monographs from the SSH and ensuring their interoperability. In sections three and four we give a comprehensive description of the entity-fishing service, focusing on its concrete applications in real use cases together with some further possible ideas on how to exploit the annotations generated. We show that entity-fishing annotations can improve both research and publishing process. In the last chapter, we briefly present further possible application scenarios that could be made available through infrastructural projects.

AB  - Abstract Open science has revolutionized scholarly communication and research assessment by introducing research data and software as first-class citizens. Scholarly knowledge graphs (SKGs) are expected to play a crucial role in generating research assessment indicators being able to aggregate bibliographic metadata records and semantic relationships describing all research products and their links (e.g., citations, affiliations, funding). However, the rapid advance of open science has led to publication workflows that do not adequately support and guarantee the authenticity of products and metadata quality required for research assessment. Additionally, the heterogeneity of research communities and the multitude of data sources and exchange formats complicate the provision of consistent and stable SKGs. This work builds upon the experience gained from pioneering and addressing these challenges in the OpenAIRE Graph SKG. The aim is twofold and broader. First, we identify obstacles to the creation of SKGs for research assessment caused by the state-of-the-art publishing workflows for publications, software, and data. Second, we describe repurposing SKGs as tools to monitor such workflows to identify and heal their shortcomings, taking advantage of tools, techniques, and practices that support the actors involved, namely research communities, scientists, organizations, data source providers, and SKG providers, to improve the Open Science scholarly publishing ecosystem.

AB  - In order for innovative cross-disciplinary research to find its audience, it must be easily discovered by scholars, professional practitioners, and the public. Journal publishing programs in libraries operate under the principle that investment in open access publishing of quality peer-reviewed research is the best way to make that research visible to a global audience and to shift control of publishing from commercial entities to the academy. Library publishers are therefore not constrained, as commercial publishers are, by the need to publish only research that will ensure a profit. This means that library publishing programs can provide a home for cross-disciplinary journals that break new ground and that may take time to find an audience.&#x0D; The lack of a profit imperative for library publishing programs also means that the platform for hosting journals is provided to journals at little or no cost, which makes library publishing very attractive to editors looking for a place to publish a new journal. Once the infrastructure is operational, the cost to add a new journal to the system is negligible because the costs of maintaining the technology are already covered. This lowers the financial barriers to starting new journals, allowing editors to focus on the task of finding and publishing excellent peer-reviewed research instead of fundraising.&#x0D; Journal platforms used by library publishers are designed so that journals published on those systems automatically follow best practices and standards, such as those outlined by the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-MPH) that make the content readily discoverable by internet search engines. These platforms also integrate the use of machine-readable licenses that clearly indicate how the content can be used. In addition to infrastructure that ensures visibility, library publishing programs benefit from existing library expertise in collaboration, technology, copyright, data management, scholarly publishing, information literacy, digital preservation, and the effective promotion of online research.

AB  - Librarians champion the value of openness in scholarship and have been powerful advocates for the sharing of research data. College and university administrators have recently joined in the push for data sharing due to funding mandates. However, the researchers who create and control the data usually determine whether and how data is shared, so it is worthwhile to look at what they are incentivized to do. The current scholarly publishing landscape plus the promotion and tenure process create a “prisoner’s dilemma” for researchers as they decide whether or not to share data, consistent with the observation that researchers in general are eager for others to share data but reluctant to do so themselves. If librarians encourage researchers to share data and promote openness without simultaneously addressing the academic incentive structure, those who are intrinsically motivated to share data will be selected against via the promotion and tenure process. This will cause those who are hostile to sharing to be disproportionately recruited into the senior ranks of academia. To mitigate the risk of this unintended consequence, librarians must advocate for a change in incentives alongside the call for greater openness. Highly-cited datasets must be given similar weight to highly-cited articles in promotion and tenure decisions in order for researchers to reap the rewards of their sharing. Librarians can help by facilitating data citation to track the impact of datasets and working to persuade higher administration of the value of rewarding data sharing in tenure and promotion.

AB  - The 2013 memorandum, ‘Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research’, issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), was a highly significant milestone in expanding public access to the peer-reviewed articles resulting from federally funded research and to the data on which those articles were based. While OSTP drew on a variety of inputs in developing their requirements, the report from the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable was particularly influential. Established in June 2009, at the request of the House Committee on Science and Technology, the Roundtable included a small group of librarians, publishers, university provosts and information science researchers representing a broad range of experiences and perspectives. The recommendations in the Roundtable's January 2010 report were incorporated into the Reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act, which provided legislative direction and support for the OSTP Memorandum. While much of the rhetoric and debate surrounding open access has been heated and hyperbolic, the Roundtable was a uniquely successful effort to bridge ideological divides and develop recommendations to inform federal policy. Imagine, then, the scene at the Capitol Lounge, a favourite watering hole for Congressional and White House staff. ‘We've got to do something! My boss is getting hammered by both sides and he's getting fed up’. There's that bill that the librarians are pushing. Sounds pretty noble. But the guy from AAP says it'll kill their business. Is he right? I don't know anything about publishing, and I have to take anything the lobbyists tell me with several grains of salt. I just want somebody with real expertise to give me some advice without me feeling like I'm being pitched all the time! She looks into her glass. ‘Our #2 says she knows one of the guys coming to the meeting this week. A physicist. Worked on big DOE projects for years, but runs a publishing outfit now. She thinks the boss'll be willing to sponsor a staff committee – a roundtable’. He looks at her quizzically. ‘Get a small group of outside experts to hash out a consensus. But you've got to get the right mix of people so that it doesn't turn into just more lobbying. And it's got to be a little under the radar so they can get something done. She thinks this guy might be the one to organize it. If he's willing’. ‘It's worth a shot. Let me know. I'll keep OSTP in the loop’. How did it come to such a pass, that stakeholders of the scholarly community who had worked hand in hand for decades were now attacking each other for undermining the very basis of scientific communication? The authors of this article had the opportunity to play a key role in the development of public access policies in the United States through their participation in the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable. Here we describe the Roundtable's genesis and impact. Supporters of open access had been building momentum since the mid-1990s. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), as the primary advocacy organization, developed a strategy that would force open access through legislation, fuelled by a rhetorical approach that cast publishers as enemies of science, corruptly locking up research in pursuit of profit. Librarians, already buffeted by increasing subscription prices in a time of tightening university budgets, saw this legislative campaign as an opportunity to weaken the publishers' market power in the course of expanding free access to taxpayer-funded research. In 2000, a petition by the Public Library of Science (PLoS) sought to pressure publishers into immediately adopting an open access model regardless of the financial consequences. By early 2004 OA advocates were working with the NIH (as well as with universities and other funding agencies) to develop policies requiring that articles from grant-funded research be made open. These early campaigns treated all science publishers as a monolithic adversary, despite wide variations in business models and practices. Certainly, the pricing policies of the larger commercial publishers seemed to reflect a captive market in which their journal prices increasingly exceeded their publication costs. The substantial profit margins of the largest made them acutely vulnerable to charges of unfair exploitation. Society publishers, whose margins and subscription rates were generally modest, had seen themselves as fierce defenders of science, but they also viewed an immediate shift to OA as an existential threat. They pushed back. The DC Principles Coalition, comprising 73 non-profit publishers with nearly 400 journals, was formed in 2004 to counter the lobbying by SPARC and its allies (Internet Archive, 2008). The perceived magnitude of the threat was shared by all publishers, and the societies were soon joined by the Association of American Publishers (AAP), principally through their Professional and Scholarly Publishing division, which brought the major commercial publishers with their substantial lobbying muscle to the table. If there had ever been a possibility for the OA advocates and the publishers to work together to develop new economic models, it was quickly lost amid the acrimony. The Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA), was introduced in 2006. FRPAA's backers hoped to legislate something similar to the NIH policy for all federally funded research. In response, the AAP arranged to have the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act introduced. This bill was intended to eviscerate the NIH policy and prevent any similar policies in the future. By 2008, the landscape had devolved to an aggressive, adversarial legislative battle between two warring factions: on one side were open access partisans, who framed their objectives in moral terms, dismissing the fundamental economic issues involved in the major industry shift they were demanding. Publishers, with a group of highly profitable commercial journal publishers now in the lead, believed OA represented a potentially lethal blow to their business model and sought to prevent any government-mandated free access. It was in this climate of inflammatory rhetoric and mutual condemnation that the plan for the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable emerged through a number of meetings and conversations in the spring of 2009. On 29 January, a public symposium entitled ‘Author Deposit Mandates for Federal Research Grantees’ was held under the auspices of the National Research Council's newly formed Board on Research Data and Information (BRDI). ‘The symposium was chaired by the BRDI Chair, Michael Lesk and the representatives of the following organizations made presentations and participated in the discussion: American Physiological Society, American Institute of Physics, American Psychological Association, Society for Science and the Public and publisher of Science News, Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) and National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC) (National Academies, n.d.).’ The intent of the symposium was to further discussion about the issues involved in extending something like the NIH Public Access Policy to other federal funding agencies, but the participants rolled out all the familiar arguments and no progress was made. This led at least some of the participants to begin to investigate alternatives for exploring the issues. These discussions led to a meeting on February 10 with Rep. Bart Gordon (D-TN), then Chair of the House Committee on Science and Technology. At this meeting, facilitated by Dr. Dahlia Sokolov, Staff Director for the Subcommittee on Research and Science Education, Gordon agreed to sponsor the Roundtable. Attending were lobbyist Tony Podesta (on behalf of Reed Elsevier), Eric Massant and Steve Manza from Reed Elsevier and Fred Dylla, Executive Director of the American Institute of Physics (AIP). Sokolov and Dylla knew each other from her time as an AIP Fellow several years earlier and had been in conversation about finding a productive way forward. At the conclusion of the meeting, Dylla was tasked with drafting a charge for the Roundtable and developing a list of potential participants. Dylla emphasized the importance of outreach to and buy-in from the research university community. At about this time, a joint statement calling for universities to ensure the broadest possible access to their work was issued by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), the Association of American Universities (AAU), the Coalition for Networked Information and NASULGC. This document, The University's Role in the Dissemination of Research and Scholarship—A Call to Action (ARL, 2009), outlined a set of principles and recommendations that were very much in keeping with the spirit of the Roundtable concept. Dylla was able to persuade John Vaughn, Executive Vice President of AAU and one of the authors of the document, to chair the Roundtable. When finally assembled, the group was a very carefully balanced mix: Three university provosts, three librarians (one of whom had been a provost), executives of four publishing companies—large, small, commercial, not-for-profit—and three scholarly communication researchers (see the end of the article for names and affiliations). On 19 June, the group met with members of the House Committee on Science and Technology and their staff. According to the official invitation from Sokolov, Committee Chair Gordon had ‘promised the scholarly publishers that he would host an off-the-record roundtable to try to get past the old arguments and facilitate a way forward in terms of federal policy for our funding agencies’. Sokolov went on to say ‘[t]he White House Office of Science and Technology Policy itself is in the early stages of thinking about an overarching federal policy, and they will be participating in this roundtable as well’ (Sokolov, personal communication, 2 June 2009). The evening before the meeting most of the group gathered for dinner in a private room at the Tabard Inn. Everyone in the group knew somebody, but no one knew everybody. Dylla and Vaughn believed that this dinner, and the ones that preceded each of the roundtable's subsequent meetings, were critical to the group's success. They deliberately sought people whose opinions and backgrounds covered a wide spectrum of views on the key issues. The members would come to the group with some perspectives that were very much at odds with each other. For consensus positions to be found, it would be necessary to establish a basis for candour and trust. The participants would need to express their disagreements freely, while listening openly, with a willingness to consider changing their minds. They were to represent their own views, not serve as mouthpieces of the organizations they worked for. Confidentiality was essential. They would follow the venerable Chatham House Rule, whereby no person's comments would be quoted by name outside of the meeting room. At that first meeting, Sokolov laid out the charge. The Roundtable would carry out a series of candid discussions aimed at defining a consensus vision for exploiting the capacity of the internet and digital communications to expand access to research results, while preserving the essential aspects of scholarly publishing. She was joined by Diane DiEuliis, Assistant Director for Life Sciences in the OSTP, who affirmed President Obama's commitment to the provision of public access to government-funded information and indicated that OSTP would be issuing a formal request for information (RFI) on the topic in the near future. The participants were each given time to briefly describe their backgrounds, areas of expertise and current views. Although the initial proposal indicated that the Roundtable would be ‘chaired by representatives of the House Science and Technology Committee with appropriate support and advice from staff in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’,11 Outline and Proposal for a House Science and Technology Committee/OSTP Roundtable Public Access to Federal Research and Data. 29 May 2009. [Note: In a 23 June email to the participants Sokolov says, ‘Attached are the list of participants and the proposal (unchanged) that was originally distributed a few weeks ago with “May29” in the filename. The only change I made was to remove the S&T Committee name from the heading (although we remain in the text of the proposal) since we removed ourselves from any kind of leadership or convening role following the conclusion of the 19 June kick-off meeting. As agreed on Friday, you should feel free to share these documents with colleagues, etc.’] the participants agreed at the conclusion of the meeting that the Roundtable would be more effective if it operated independently. John Vaughn, as chair, offered to host subsequent meetings at the AAU offices. Representatives of the Committee and OSTP attended these meetings (in person or by phone), but served primarily as resources, rather than full participants. No funding or other support was provided by the Committee or OSTP. (AAU and AAP each contributed $5 K for expenses along with administrative support). Structuring the Roundtable this way ensured that the final report truly represented the independent views of the participants. The Roundtable met in person three more times (10 July, 22 July and 7 August) for 4-h sessions, with dinner the evening before. As noted above, Vaughn and Dylla believed that these shared meals were beneficial for developing the relationships necessary to support candid discussions. These discussions were part fact-finding, part advocacy, part investigation of the effects of various proposals on the full range of constituencies. Although some of the initial disagreements were intense, the focus remained clear—could they establish consensus recommendations that would inform US government policy? At the outset there was certainly some scepticism among the participants about the likelihood of achieving that. Although the initial charge to the Roundtable was quite broad and could be construed to include such research outputs as datasets and the various progress reports required by granting agencies, the group quickly agreed to concentrate on peer-reviewed publications. This was the most contentious area for the affected constituencies, and if the Roundtable was going to develop concrete recommendations in only a few months, the scope needed to be tightly focused. The members were determined to base their recommendations in fact rather than ideology and advocacy. Still, they recognized that a major research project investigating all of the relevant aspects of scholarly publication would require time and resources far beyond what they had available. In addressing this challenge, the contributions from the researchers were invaluable. They were able to bring a wealth of material covering access issues, publishing economics, the behaviour of researchers, the decision-making processes of librarians and more. Nonetheless, large gaps in the knowledge base remained. Considerable time was spent discussing business models and the effects of embargoes (i.e., the length of time between the initial publication of a research article and a version of the article being made freely available to the public). PLoS provided a detailed example of one type of OA publisher, but in general, the lack of transparency by publishers of all types, along with their vast variability, made it impossible to make more than general observations and conclusions. The data available on the effects of embargoes was scant and anecdotal, eliminating the possibility of broad fact-based conclusions. There was a shared understanding that because of the likelihood of major technological impacts in just the next few years, any policies put in place needed to be flexible and subject to change. This led many in the group to argue that a legislative mandate would be unwise because it would be difficult to modify in response to changing conditions. A better approach would be flexible policies coordinated by OSTP and developed in close consultation with all of the stakeholders. All members agreed that the federal government needed to play a role, but there continued to be strong disagreements about how extensive and prescriptive that role should be. Although the guidelines from Sokolov indicated that the group was not expected to revisit the NIH Policy, which the Committee and the White House considered settled, the Roundtable spent time discussing the perceived pros and cons of the policy in order to identify features that might be promulgated across the other federal funding agencies. By the end of the second meeting, the group had identified five possible models (including the NIH policy). They developed a scoring system that each member could use to evaluate the different models. Using feedback from the scoring sheets, a drafting committee of Dylla, O'Donnell, Taylor and Vaughn developed a ‘green paper’ draft for discussion at the last of the in-person meetings. As summer moved to fall, a set of broad recommendations emerged that all of the members felt they could generally support. The drafting team used the green paper as the basis for the first draft of the full report, which was distributed to the members in early November. There followed a series of conference calls to develop and refine the report. With the written language in front of them, the remaining disagreements sharpened. Some of the calls were contentious, and there were moments when it looked as if the entire effort might fall apart. But the members had each put in a great deal of time and effort, and the meetings during the summer had established a basis of trust, enabling the group to work through their disagreements towards mutual understanding. What the dissents come down to is a matter of control and the role of government. I hope it is not a caricature of the dissents to say that, in the end, Patterson, coming from his experience with the most successful open access publisher to date, felt that the report did not call strongly enough for a firm government hand in moving expeditiously toward full open access. He believes that it is time. Chi, informed by his experience in leadership with the most successful commercial STM publisher in the world, ultimately felt that the report allowed for too much government interference in achieving the public access goal. The disagreement is not over the necessity of expanded access, but over how fast to move and how strong a role the government should be allowed to take. This is an important discussion to have. (Plutchak, 2010) Patterson and Chi both reviewed the draft of the editorial before it was published and gave it their blessing. Patterson: ‘As far as your comments about myself are concerned, I think you're very fair. Many thanks again’ (Patterson, personal communication, 20 May 2010). Chi: ‘I think this is a very thoughtful piece and I appreciate the personal perspective that you expresses [sic] here of the substance of the RT and not the PR [i.e., public relations]. I have absolutely no objection to the accuracy of what you describe where my name is attributed’ (Chi, personal communication, 24 May 2010). The Report, along with the two dissents, was published in January 2010 and delivered to Congress and the White House (Scholarly Publishing Roundtable, 2010). Reactions from the scholarly communication community were predictably mixed. Within hours of the report's release, Peter Suber (Director of the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication and a prolific OA advocate) commented, saying that ‘[t]here's a lot to like here’. However, he focused mostly on the report's failure to call for an OA mandate. He went on, ‘One more clue as to why the group may have decided not to endorse OA mandates: The only working scientists on the panel were either in library science or had become publishers. I respect all the participants, but the panel omitted a significant, probably the most significant, stakeholder group’ (Suber, 2010). In fact, the very extensive publication records of a number of Roundtable members attest to their significant contributions as working scientists in economics, physics, humanities, neurosciences and scholarly communication. The Association of American University Publishers (AAUP) was enthusiastic, saying ‘we think it vital that the Roundtable's further recommendations, with their emphasis on consultation, cooperation, interoperability, authority, preservation and long-term sustainability be followed’ (Association of American Universities Presses, n.d.). The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM), while applauding the Roundtable's efforts and expressing support for the general principles, took issue with some of the recommendations, saying ‘while STM supports US agencies in the development of public access policies to the results of research funded by those agencies, we do not agree that the scholarly articles arising from publisher investment and value add fall under this category’ (STM, 2010). Rick Anderson (then the Associate Dean for Collections & Scholarly Communication at the University of Utah) writing in Learned Publishing, said ‘the report leaves room for traditional publishing with its explicit support for the idea of limited embargoes. If that support leaves some in the open access and STM publishing communities equally dissatisfied, that is probably a mark of success. Given the intractable economic realities that govern knowledge creation, it seems clear to me that the Roundtable's vision of a future that includes ‘diverse and flexible market-driven approaches’ is spot on’ (Anderson, 2010). In the aftermath of the Report's release, members of the Roundtable worked to promote awareness and highlight the recommendations. Editorials were written (in Science and the Journal of the Medical Library Association) (Courant et al., 2010; Plutchak, 2010) and numerous conference presentations were made (e.g., the Council of Engineering and Scientific Society Executives [CESSE], the Charleston Conference, the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers [ALPSP], UKSG [formerly the United Kingdom Serials Group]). In the fall of 2010, a comprehensive bill titled The America COMPETES Act (ACA) was brought up for its 5-year renewal as the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act (ACRA) (U.S. House of Representatives, 2010). ACRA required the establishment of an Interagency Task Force, part of which was a Public Access Committee (U.S. House of Representatives, 2011). The language describing the charge to the Committee drew directly from the Roundtable report. The bill was passed by Congress in December of 2010 and signed into law by President Obama in January 2011. Three Roundtable members (Dylla, Plutchak and Taylor) testified on these issues before Congress in March 2012. The hearing before the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology was titled ‘Federally Funded Research: Examining Public Access and Scholarly Publication Interests’. While two of the five witnesses argued for the necessity of passing FRPAA, the Roundtable members emphasized the importance of the flexibility and cross-community coordination embodied in the Report's recommendations (Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council, 2012). Also in March 2012, the aforementioned Public Access Committee delivered its report to Congress, specifying that the recommendations were based on two public RFIs and the Report from the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable (U.S. House of Representatives, 2012). The Committee's report provided important validation for the Roundtable's recommendations and OSTP's guidelines, development of which was well under way. In the spring of 2012, Michael Stebbins, the person at OSTP who was primarily responsible for drafting those guidelines, was reaching out to a number of constituencies to inform OSTP's thinking. It wasn't easy work, but the general intent and outline of the guidelines were in place. The major remaining sticking point was the length of any embargo that would be specified. SPARC and its allies were continuing to push for a maximum 6 months for all publications, arguing that the lack of demonstrable negative impacts on publishers from the NIH 12-month embargo proved that a shorter embargo would not harm publishers. Meanwhile, the publisher lobby was continuing to argue that anything shorter than 12 months would be unsustainable. They claimed the additional 6-month window was critical, because for subscription journals the typical subscription period was 12 months and more than half of total downloads frequently occurred during that period. Besides, they said, not enough time had gone by since the imposition of the NIH policy to reveal evidence of a clear impact on the subscribing patterns of librarians. In early May, several members of the Roundtable met with Stebbins. They advised cautious experimentation and flexibility. The Report had not specified a specific embargo term, recommending that ‘[t]he length of an embargo period should be as short as possible to reflect an appropriate balance between a commitment to rapid public access and the need to allow orderly evolution of business practices among established journals’ (Scholarly Publishing Roundtable, 2010). The Report also argued that different disciplines might warrant different embargo periods, but that, in general, embargoes between 0 and 12 months seemed reasonable. Over time, individual agencies might lengthen or shorten the embargo period as they and the communities they worked with gained more experience. The meeting concluded as Stebbins thanked the Roundtable members and assured them that the Report's recommendations were definitely being taken into account. Several weeks later, SPARC and its allies launched a Change.org petition, urging ‘President Obama to act now to implement open access policies for all federal agencies that fund scientific research’. Impatience with the Obama administration's lack of a public stand on open access was rising. The OSTP guidelines were well underway, but there had been no public statement from the White House, despite years of intense lobbying. The petition's organizers hoped that the petition process would force OSTP's hand, while keeping the issue alive within the larger scholarly community. The rules for Change.org specified that if a petition crossed the 25,000 signature threshold within 30 days the administration was required to respond. That number was crossed within 2 weeks (eventually reaching 65,704) and in early June the organizers claimed victory (Higgins, 2012). Nonetheless, it would be another 8 months (not until after Obama's second inauguration) before the release of the OSTP memorandum ‘Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research’ (Holdren, 2013). Coincident with that release, Dr. John Holdren, OSTP's Director, finally posted the official Obama administration response to the petition, thanking the petitioners for their participation (We the People, 2012). OSTP had ‘been looking into this issue for some time and has reached out to the public on two occasions for input on the question of how best to achieve this goal of democratizing the results of federally funded research’. The petition, he wrote, ‘has been important to our discussions’. The petition's organizers may not have gotten all they wanted or expected, but the Holdren memo, as it came to be called, was a major milestone in the advancement of public access. The OSTP guidelines would become the critical directives for federal agencies that provided $100 million or more in research funding annually. They included most of the key elements from the Roundtable report. They emphasized the importance of maintaining archives and interoperability. They encouraged public–private collaboration and innovation. They specified a maximum 12-month embargo, while encouraging flexibility and requiring agencies to establish a process for petitions, based on evidence, to adjust the embargo timeframe. Over the next few years, 22 federal agencies developed public access plans for publications and data based on the directives in this memo. As the Roundtable members anticipated, the scholarly communication landscape has changed considerably over the decade plus since the release of the Report. As a result of the Holdren memo, virtually all new peer-reviewed publications based on federally funded research are freely available, in some form, no later than 12 months after publication and in many instances much sooner. Within months, spurred on by the Holdren memo, a group of publishers began to develop CHORUS (originally an acronym for Clearing House for the Open Research of the United States, but dropped as an acronym when the organization started working in other countries) as a vehicle for providing public access to articles from the publisher sites, exemplifying the kind of public-private collaboration envisioned by the Roundtable and OSTP (Dylla & Salmon, 2020). The ARL, in cooperation with AAU and the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU—formerly NASULGC), offered another proposed solution to the public access mandate in the form of the Shared Access Research Ecosystem (SHARE), ‘a system of cross institutional digital repositories’ (Association of Research Libraries, 2013). Although open data policies were outside the scope of the Roundtable's work, they were included in the Holdren directive. While data has proven to be a much more difficult challenge, significant progress is being made. Procedures and compliance are still much more rudimentary than for publications, but all of the federal agencies now have detailed data archiving requirements. Many publishers have also developed policies that encourage or require authors to make the data supporting their articles publicly available. Open access (broadly defined) has advanced considerably, whether via innovation among publishers or by the efforts of research funders. Most publishers provide opportunities for making articles open. Plan S, developed by a coalition of European funding agencies, hopes to incentivize more publishers to develop open access policies (Plan, n.d.). Across the globe, commercial and not-for-profit publishers, national organizations, libraries and library consortia are working together to develop transformative agreements that continue to open up the world's scholarly literature. Disagreements are (still) robust and discussions and negotiations can be contentious. But progress continues to be made, as long as all of the stakeholders are willing to remain engaged and committed to seeking balanced solutions to often conflicting goals. The early proponents of open access framed it as a moral crusade. Believing that the public interest and private interests could never be reconciled, the OA movement pursued a legislative goal that would mandate a particular one size for all type of open access, regardless of what the (intended or unintended) consequences might be. The understandably defensive publishing sector was split into two quite different groups: commercial journal publishers, some of which generated generous profits with seemingly unrestrained pricing policies and not-for-profit academic and scientific society publishers, whose generally lower cost journals nonetheless produced critical revenue for their societies, whose memberships comprised primarily the researchers whose work they published. One of the paralysing results of this pitched battle was that individuals who might have been allies in other circumstances found themselves on the opposite sides of a very public rhetorical war. Both sides dug in, and very little progress could be made. The Roundtable was successful in having a major impact because it took a very different approach. Collaboration and compromise are very difficult. Trust is hard to come by. The organizers of the Roundtable believed that by bringing together people with the full range of views in an atmosphere of trust, with a willingness to listen, key people could find enough agreement to influence public policy in ways that would make a significant difference. The legislative mandates desired by the OA partisans have not come to fruition, but thanks in significant measure to that small group of determined individuals who were committed to listening to each other in the pursuit of consensus, many of the outcomes those partisans desired have come to pass. The authors were members of the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable and have no other conflicts of interest relevant to this article. All authors participated in the conceptualization and writing. T.

AB  - The academic publication takes on an increasingly relevant place to shape, on the one hand, the scholar’s prestige, and on the other, the prestige of the institution to which he or she is attached. In addition, academic publishing is vital for the development of scientific knowledge and the contribution to the community. This paper analyzes several dimensions that may be central to academic publishing in the near future. To this end, in methodological terms, a qualitative approach was favored, namely through the documentary analysis of scientific writings that analyze this topic. The results of this analysis reveal that this is a process in constant and accelerated development, but there will have to be criteria and processes for selecting what is scientifically relevant from what is called “noise” in scientific publishing. Increasing quality will have to be a fundamental element in this process.

AB  - Over the last five years, scholarly publishing has turned its attention towards metadata; increasingly recognizing it as a strategic priority for digital development. In a 2017 Imbue Partners study based on interviews with industry leaders, metadata was identified as of the highest importance in digital transformation. With an understanding that metadata improvements can be most efficiently made in collaboration, scholarly communications communities are now convening to find ways to jointly improve metadata.Metadata 2020 is a project-driven collaboration of over 120 individuals across scholarly communications, convening to find ways to improve metadata that is connected, reusable, and open for all research outputs. Having launched in September 2017, the collaboration now includes 5 community groups and 6 projects.We include publishers, librarians, service providers, data publishers and repositories, researchers and funders in our work to advance metadata for scholarly communications, to ensure consideration of all stakeholder needs in scholarly communications.In this presentation, we will outline some of the key observations of our community groups around the metadata challenges they face; and explain how these observations evolved into the formation of our 6 cross-community projects. The projects that we will briefly outline include:Researcher CommunicationsMetadata Recommendations and Element MappingsDefining the Terms We Use About MetadataIncentives for Improving Metadata QualityShared Best Practice and PrinciplesMetadata Evaluation and GuidanceGiving a brief overview of the remit and progress to date of each project, we will invite participation from attendees, and provide information about when key resources and guidance will be made available to the communities we serve.

AB  - The academic publication takes on an increasingly relevant place to shape, on the one hand, the scholar’s prestige, and on the other, the prestige of the institution to which he or she is attached. In addition, academic publishing is vital for the development of scientific knowledge and the contribution to the community. This paper analyzes several dimensions that may be central to academic publishing in the near future. To this end, in methodological terms, a qualitative approach was favored, namely through the documentary analysis of scientific writings that analyze this topic. The results of this analysis reveal that this is a process in constant and accelerated development, but there will have to be criteria and processes for selecting what is scientifically relevant from what is called “noise” in scientific publishing. Increasing quality will have to be a fundamental element in this process.

AB  - Andy Neilly was the first nonfamily member to assume the presidency at Wiley.That was in 1971, five years before I joined the company as an acquisitions editor for professional and reference books in mechanical and industrial engineering.Those were heady days.The hours were 8:30 to 4:30 and the floor I was on seemed empty a few minutes after closing; commuters were already on their way to their trains from Grand Central and Penn Station.As he was leaving one day, I heard Andy crack that he was heading home because "you can't make any money around here," but the reality was that the dollar spigot was running just fine in those days, when the Wiley family was ceding day-to-day control to professional managers.Andy still lives in Connecticut.He's 94 and sounds sharp and hearty on the phone.His eyesight isn't great, so he's had to give up his watercolors.

AB  - For more than 110 years, the raison d’etre of The Electrochemical Society has been the broad and effective dissemination of technical and scientific information through technical meetings and publications. Specifically, archival publications make available, to current and future generations, peer-reviewed advances in scientific and engineering fields within the scope of ECS. Many of these entities can benefit greatly from this content via online publication. Our intent is to provide the best quality and widest dissemination possible to our members and to the scientific/technological community at large. The radical changes in scholarly publishing venues made possible by the Internet, and recent advances in electronics technology, greatly expand the potential for wide availability of the content covered by ECS. Of immediate interest in this regard is the unrestricted access to scholarly work via the Internet referred to as Open Access (OA). Because professional societies serve authors, readers, and developers of scientific and technological content, we feel that ECS and other societies should lead the way in the establishment of low cost, effective, and efficient OA approaches. Toward that end, ECS has embarked on a quest to ultimately offer full OA (no charge to authors, readers, libraries, or institutional members) for our four peerreviewed journals. The first step toward this goal is the implementation of our Author Choice Open Access program, which began early this year. As the name implies, authors now have the choice of having their accepted papers published as Open Access articles. Because this intent represents a new paradigm for ECS, we must determine the appropriate business model to realize our goal. Details of the various possibilities are described in other articles in the spring 2014 issue of Interface (http://www.electrochem.org/dl/ interface/spr/spr14/if_spr14.htm) and on the ECS website (http:// www.electrochem.org/oa/).

AB  - <p class="first" id="d19375474e64">This poster showcases how tools and technology can support academic publishers and university presses by optimizing workflows and automating processes to enable them to publish and share scholarly content. Exploring the end-to-end publishing process from the ideation and creation workflows, to managing content distribution and dissemination, and calculating royalties and analyzing sales, the poster illustrates how tools and technology can help scholarly publishers to: 1) Inform and improve acquisition decisions; 2) Manage any saleable product—from physical books to digital content, journals, merchandise, and licenses—plus a wide range of identifiers (including those beyond the ISBN); 3) Meet open access requirements; 4) Support the peer review process; 5) Streamline the production process; 6) Make appropriate printing decisions, including POD; 7) Share relevant content through appropriate channels consisting of multiple distributors, aggregators, libraries, websites and platforms; 8) Automate royalty calculations and statement delivery; and 9) Better understand sales trends to inform future publishing and dissemination decisions.

AB  - Scholarly communication and publishing are increasingly taking place in the electronic environment. With a growing proportion of the scholarly record now existing only in digital format, serious and pressing issues regarding access and preservation are being raised that are central to future scholarship. At the same time, the desire of scholars to maximize readership of their research and to take control of the scholarly communication process back from the restrictive domain of commercial publishing has prompted the proliferation of access options and experimental models of publishing. This paper examines the emerging trend of university-based institutional repositories (IRs) designed to capture the scholarly output of an institution and to maximize the research impact of this output. The relationship of this trend to the open access movement is discussed and challenges and opportunities for using IRs to promote new modes of scholarship are provided.

AB  - Recently I was editing an article accepted for publication and discovered that the authors described an example using a phrase that replaced part of a word with ∗∗, as many do when posting on social media. The word in question was a derisive slang term that refers to a woman. It was not as shocking as the F-word, but certainly not acceptable language. I realized that I had not yet come across this dilemma in my experience, even though I have served in an editorial role for 12 years. I have published articles that included profane words such as hell or damn from qualitative interviews; while these were distasteful, I found the ∗∗ word to be worse. Yet, this was the term that was used by the authors and inclusion would reflect accuracy in this discussion. This issue piqued my interest and I decided to investigate bad language in scholarly writing in the literature. For my search I used terms such as “profanity,” “swearing,” “obscenity,” and “slang.” I also queried the editors and others who participate in the International Academy of Nursing Editors (INANE) email discussion. For my report herein, I consider bad language to be profanity of all types and slang or colloquialisms that are hurtful and possibly incendiary. I offer my findings and include some thoughts for consideration that I believe will assist both editors and authors of scholarly manuscripts who face this dilemma. Few academic publications have directly addressed bad language in scholarly writing. Those that have considered profanity or offensive slang, such as slurs, were dated. Style manuals offered advice about writing tone and using accurate terms, but were published at a time when it was likely less acceptable to see this type of language in print and thus this concern was not specifically addressed. However, even while dated, they did offer suggestions that may apply to this current and growing dilemma. For example, both print and online resources such as the APA Manual (APA, 2) and the Purdue Online Writing Lab, ([OWL], 1995–2019;) discussed similar topics about possibly offensive language in scholarly writing, due to bias related to gender, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, disabilities, or age, and the use of mild slang and colloquial terms in general. In their classic, The Elements of Style, Strunk and White (2000) offered two helpful suggestions. First, if use of a slang word is deemed necessary, refrain from drawing further attention to it by adding quotation marks for emphasis; rather just use it. They also noted the dynamic nature of language, with word meanings always in a state of change. Thus, it is better to consider established usage over current trends. Corbett and Finkel (5) noted that no single word can be labeled as inappropriate in and of itself, and this may be especially so in technical writing where words or practices common to that audience are not out of place. This assertion supports the use of exact quotes that may include words offensive to some readers. The Purdue OWL (1995–2019) website does not specifically address profanity, but includes information about levels of formality that suggests a style of writing appropriate to both your purpose and the expectations of your audience. This website notes that it is acceptable to include slang or jargon when you write for an audience that includes members of a group who would frequently use and understand these terms. It is clear that the use of offensive slang and every manner of profanity is on the rise (Bergen, 3), and this has been addressed frequently related to its use in non-scholarly, online venues such as websites, blogs, or social media. Two examples are noteworthy. A piece published in The New York Times (Sheidlower, 7) stated that as a society we have become more comfortable with profanity and suggested that the media has not kept the same pace, instead using euphemisms or dashes or asterisks as part of the offensive word. Sheidlower (7) described an example published in an academic journal in 1934 that discussed the history of a highly offensive profane term, the F-word, without even using it once, much as I am doing right now. The Associated Press Stylebook (AP, 2019) also recommends a partial spelling, suggesting hyphens in place of some letters in the word to convey the meeting without including exact term and inclusion of an editor's note. Bergen (2016), a professor of cognitive science who studies swearing and what it reveals about us, our use of language, and our brains, noted the temporal aspect of profanity and the increasing use of slurs. He described in his book multiple examples of words that used to be or have become profane, due to current social constructs. Reading about the evolution of these words, it is not unreasonable to wonder whether any word we may innocently use in its current context might be considered profane sooner or later! Bergen (3) suggested that bans are typically ineffectual. We use many similar sounding words or phrases, known as minced oaths, to avoid profanity, such as oh sugar, or shut the front door. He noted one particularly troublesome current trend among profanity usage, that of slurs, suggesting this as an exception to otherwise harmless swearing and far more offensive to most. Considering use of slurs on the continuum of free speech to censorship, Bergen (3) offers the old adage that just because you can it does not mean you should. Both the temporal aspect of word meanings and the harmful potential of slurs are solid reasons to thoughtfully consider decisions about including bad language in scholarly print. As early as 1993, an article in Editor & Publisher questioned whether publishing profanities constituted censorship to avoid controversy, noting that, “arguments for and against using certain terms are subjective” (Venit, as cited by Case, 4, p.11). One viewpoint offered in the article suggested the danger of editing profanity and leaving the reader to imagine something much worse. The author asserted that in newsrooms, decisions are made on a daily basis about questionable words and advised that discussions with multiple people are helpful in this process to assure different perspectives are represented. To that end, this discussion synthesizes the thoughts of the 15 editors who participated in the INANE listserv conversation about my query regarding use of bad language in scholarly nursing journals. The discussion expanded into recognizing phoniness and flowery language, often referred to in print as bullshit, in academic writing in general and specific to nursing. This article considers use of profane or offensive slur words only, versus their connotation as applied to critique academic writing which is beyond the scope of this article. Discussion related using profanity or offensive slang considered the temporal element of language; interest versus scholarly tone; and contextual purity versus scholarly tone. Several editors also offered helpful questions to consider when making such a decision. One editor referred to the temporal element discussed in the literature, especially of offensive slang, and noted that this is often not considered. Similar to thoughts from Bergen (3), Strunk and White (2000), and information from the APA Manual (2), he noted that, “words have the power we assign them – Scandalous as it would be to use the words bloody and bugger in 1750, today these get barely a chuckle. Ten years from now, it may again be scandalous” (Personal communication, D. Olson, January 30, 2019). The discussion considered the dilemma of creating interest among readers versus adherence to scholarly tone. One editor commented that being provocative may have a purpose, but passages were still possibly borderline offensive and thus not appropriate. Another felt that the benefits of using bad language rarely outweighed the risk and suggested consideration as to whether the point could be made without that specific word. Several suggestions from editors mirrored practices common in publishing, such as using an asterisk as part of the spelling of the word; inserting the word [expletive] or leaving a space; and adding a disclaimer to explain the omission of certain words (AP, 2019; APA 2; Sheidlower, 7). These editors advised taking the high road (i.e., omit the offensive word) and use of discretion. A few editors had mixed feelings, first noting that bad language is not appropriate in scholarly journals in general, but making the exception of quotes from qualitative data. Direct quotes are an important component to demonstrate trustworthiness in a qualitative study. One editor gave an example of publishing words as they were spoken, but also noted that she had not been presented anything more offensive than the word bitch, rather mild in nature compared to some other profanity. Even while supporting the purity of qualitative data to provide absolute context from the quotation, one person felt that using bad language in these quotes is still a slippery slope that can lead to a lower standard. The increasing use of slurs that Bergen (3) noted adds another layer of complexity to the decision to honor contextual purity with direct quotes including that type of language. Several participants (personal communications, J. Castner, December 22, 2018, and A. Valdez, January 30, 2019) offered questions to consider when making the decision to include bad language in a scholarly publication, as follows: Discussing these questions prior to the final decision, or even before the occasion arises, may inform an appropriate rationale to support whatever action is taken. There are multiple recommendations related to appropriate writing for scholarly work. Because this article is considering profanity and offensive slang, these included below are specific to use of bad language. Resources do address similar topics about possibly offensive language due to bias related to gender, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, disabilities, or age; and the use of mild slang and colloquial terms in general. These may be helpful to inform a decision about the use of bad language. This is important to consider as some profanity or offensive slang, specifically slurs, can also reflect such biases, including the use of labels (APA, 2; Bergen, 3). Use a style manual to consider similar recommendations that may also be appropriate to inform your final decision. Check for precedents. If you are an editor, investigate how this may have been handled in the past. If you are an author, investigate your selected journal to see if you can find an example of bad language. Start by mirroring the editorial strategies of what has been previously published. Resist making the decision in a vacuum; seek input from others. If appropriate, be sure that your supervisors are aware of the dilemma and the support for any decision. The APA manual (2) offers a suggestion for writers of historical information. The challenge in this context is to preserve historical accuracy and the manual recommends using the original language, but including an asterisk the first time it is used, with an explanatory comment. This strategy could be useful to indicate rationale for including language from raw data to preserve context, especially in cases where the word meaning has evolved since the original usage, and also offers an explanation for this decision. The APA manual (2) recommends respect for people's preferences, and the change in preferences over time. A quick Google search revealed several university-based or reputable organizational sources to access an LGBTQ glossary of terms. Make an effort to find the most current acceptable language to avoid unintentional slang that may be hurtful or inappropriate. Consider the purpose of the manuscript, the journal, and the audience for this venue (Purdue OWL, 1995–2019). It may be entirely appropriate to quote bad language when including qualitative data in a report for a research journal where the readers will understand and appreciate inclusion of exact quotes. You might wonder how my dilemma ended. Because one of my areas of expertise is qualitative methods, I am a purist when it comes to quoting language to preserve the context to every extent possible. That does not mean I do not struggle with the use of this type of language in scholarly writing. After considering the risks versus benefits, as suggested by one of the editors, I had a discussion with the authors about my concerns. The word in question was a slur. It was not a quote, but an example of sexual harassment in an article about that topic. They felt strongly about using the word as is, but were willing to allow me to first state it in a scholarly way and then use it parenthetically as an example, qualifying it as a colloquial term. I was comfortable with that decision because I felt we put intentional thought into this dilemma, at minimum. Also, this was middle of the road bad language - not the worst you can imagine. The compromise to use the word, but note it as colloquial, acknowledged explicitly that we were stepping away from scholarly tone to preserve integrity of data. I still ask myself, could I do this if the word were even more incendiary? Best practice is for each editor and writer to give intentional consideration to potential risks and benefits of using a particular incendiary word or phrase. The goal is to reach consensus and thoughtfully represent the individual manuscript and journal content. Jacqueline K.

AB  - A Review of:Buitrago Ciro, J. (2022). How are academic libraries in Spanish-speaking Latin America responding to new models of scholarly communication and predatory publishing? Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 54(3), 373–388. https://doi.org/10.1177/09610006211016533Objective – To examine the current state of knowledge among academic librarians in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America regarding open access and predatory publishing. Furthermore, the study sought to explore actions or potential plans among this group that could allow them to better assist researchers with these aspects of scholarly publishing literacy. Design – An online survey, followed by interviews with self-selected participants. Setting – Academic libraries in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. Subjects – 104 librarians in the online survey and seven librarians in the interviews, each holding a position in an academic library in Spanish-speaking Latin America. Methods – An anonymous survey in Spanish consisting of 34 required questions was built with SurveyMonkey and distributed to participants between 30 July 2020 and 20 September 2020. Survey respondents were directed to contact the author via email if they wished to participate in follow-up interviews. Interviews were then conducted in Spanish over Zoom between 10 October 2020 and 10 November 2020, and the transcripts were coded and analyzed with NVivo. Main Results – Of the survey’s respondents, 31.73% indicated that their library has a scholarly communication librarian, 29.81% noted that the library receives requests for assistance with finding journals in which to publish at least once per week, and 16.35% reported this type of request at least 1-2 times per month. In specific regard to predatory publishing, almost 52.88% of respondents indicated that they never receive questions on this topic, and 25.00% answered that users seek this kind of information less than once per month. Additionally, 31.73% responded that information on predatory publishing is not available at their library, and 42.31% rated their own knowledge of predatory publishing as fair to very poor. Finally, 44.23% reported plans to develop training or information to educate their institution’s research communities about predatory publishing, and 2.88% planned to recruit a scholarly communications specialist. In interviews, all participants agreed that exchanging information with other institutions with more knowledge and services related to predatory publishing would be beneficial. Three interviewees saw a general role for the library in providing information on predatory publishing, and three others indicated that this should be a leadership role when working in conjunction with other departments. All participants saw a lack of knowledge about predatory publishing as one of the primary difficulties for academic libraries, and three reported that the survey itself had led them to recognize the importance of the library’s role in scholarly communication literacy and create plans for their library to assist researchers in regard to predatory publishing. Conclusion – Academic libraries in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America are not yet offering robust support for researchers concerning predatory publishing, but there is growing recognition of the issue, as well as interest in further developing expertise among librarians. Collaboration and exchanges of information with other institutions with more developed resources related to predatory publishing is viewed positively and may build upon existing knowledge of open access publishing.

AB  - To address the complexities researchers face during publication, and the potential communitywide benefits of wider adoption of clear data policies, the publisher Springer Nature has developed a standardized, common framework for the research data policies of all its journals. An expert working group was convened to audit and identify common features of research data policies of the journals published by Springer Nature, where policies were present. The group then consulted with approximately 30 editors, covering all research disciplines within the organisation. The group also consulted with academic editors, librarians and funders, which informed development of the framework and the creation of supporting resources. Four types of data policy were defined in recognition that some journals and research communities are more ready than others to adopt strong data policies. As of January 2017 more than 700 journals have adopted a standard policy and this number is growing weekly. To potentially enable standardization and harmonization of data policy across funders, institutions, repositories, societies and other publishers, the policy framework was made available under a Creative Commons license. However, the framework requires wider debate with these stakeholders and an Interest Group within the Research Data Alliance (RDA) has been formed to initiate this process.

AB  - Open access publishing has frequently been proposed as a solution to the serials crisis, which involved unsustainable budgetary pressures on libraries due to hyperinflation of subscription costs. The majority of open access articles are published in a minority of journals that levy article processing charges (APCs) paid by authors or their institutions upon acceptance. Increases in APCs is proceeding at a rate three times that which would be expected if APCs were indexed according to inflation. As increasingly ambitious funder mandates are proposed, such as Plan S, it is important to evaluate whether authors show signs of price sensitivity in journal selection by avoiding journals that introduce or increase their APCs. Examining journals that introduced an APC 4-5 years after launch or when flipping from a subscription model to immediate open access model showed no evidence that APC introduction reduced article volumes. Multilevel modelling of APC sensitivity across 319 journals published by the four largest APC-funded dedicated commercial open access publishers (BMC, Frontiers, MDPI, and Hindawi) revealed that from 2012 to 2018 higher APCs were actually associated with increased article volumes. These findings indicate that APC hyperinflation is not suppressed through market competition and author choice. Instead, demand for scholarly journal publications may be more similar to demand for necessities, or even prestige goods, which will support APC hyperinflation to the detriment of researchers, institutions, and funders.

AB  - Peer review is a necessary process with a long history of complaints, including over-solicitation of a small number of reviewers, delays, inadequate numbers of reviewers, and a lack of incentives to provide strong reviews or avoid reviews with little helpful information for the author. In the era of Web-based distribution of research, through working paper or project reports, anonymous peer reviews are much less likely. The Journal of Ocean and Coastal Economics will use signed peer reviews and an open communication process among authors, reviewers, and editors. This approach, to be developed over time, should lead to stronger communication of research results for the Journal's readers.

AB  - Les technologies d'édition numérique sont à l'origine des documents comme les articles ou les ouvrages, et elles constituent un exemple original d'objet nativement numérique. Dynamiques, modulables, protéiformes, plusieurs exemples récents de technologies tendent à interroger leur statut. Si notre point de départ est la comparaison entre les documents et les technologies d'édition numérique, nous les dissocierons en soulignant la dimension réflexive de ces technologies. Cet article présente trois exemples : Distill, une revue dont les articles sont gérés comme des programmes informatiques ; Quire, une chaîne de publication qui génère des livres multiformes ; Stylo, un éditeur de texte sémantique qui permet l'écriture dans un contexte d'édition scientifique. Notre méthodologie consiste en l'analyse de ces trois systèmes de publication, emblématiques des transformations numériques à l'œuvre, basée sur trois critères (structure, inscription et réflexivité). Ces trois initiatives rassemblent nombre des spécificités propres aux objets nativement numériques qui nous entourent désormais, alors que les technologies d'édition traditionnelles reposent principalement sur une chaîne d'impression. Digital publishing technologies are the mean of production of documents such as articles or books, these technologies are therefore original examples of born-digital object. Dynamic, modular, protean. Several recent examples of these technologies tend to question their status. Our starting point is the comparison between documents and digital publishing technologies. However, we will separate them by emphasizing the reflective dimension of these technologies. This paper presents three examples: Distill, a journal whose articles are managed as computer programs; Quire, a publishing framework that generates multiform books; Stylo, a semantic text editor that allows writing in a scholarly publishing context. Our methodology consists in the analysis of these three publication systems, emblematic of the digital transformations at work, based on three criteria (structure, registration and reflection). The main interest of these three initiatives is to bring together many of the specificities of born-digital objects that now surround us, whereas traditional editing technologies rely mainly on print workflow.

AB  - Through 2015 and into 2016, Canadian academic libraries’ collections budgets were severely strained due to the steady decline of the CAD/USD exchange rate. As most subscription fees for electronic resources (e-resources) are billed in US dollars, the&#x0D; falling value of the Canadian dollar significantly reduced libraries’ purchasing power. This study is based on a survey of the English-speaking member institutions of the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN), a Canadian collections consortium, carried out to determine the impact of the poor exchange rate on collections&#x0D; development and how libraries are coping with new budgetary pressures. Librarians from 33 universities provided survey responses. Of these, 22 participated in telephone interviews to further discuss concerns and ideas regarding the current crisis. The study finds that all participant libraries have taken actions to address the budgetary shortfall, including cancelling serial and database subscriptions, negotiating lower costs with vendors, purchasing fewer monographs, and soliciting additional funding from their&#x0D; institutions. While the financial strain resulting from exchange rate fluctuations is indeed a significant problem for which solutions should be sought, several respondents stressed that it only exacerbates the ongoing inflation of e-resource subscriptions. This deeper and enduring issue, which is expected to outlast the present exchange rate crisis, is enabled by an inherently flawed scholarly publishing system. Thus, librarians engaged in discussions with their wider academic communities concerning collections budgets should not focus exclusively on the exchange rate but should leverage the&#x0D; opportunity to explore alternatives to the current scholarly communication model. If solutions exist, they will likely only be achieved through the support of faculty and university administrators, as well as cooperation among post-secondary institutions and&#x0D; library consortia.&#x0D; &#x0D; Au cours de l’année 2015 et au début 2016, les budgets des collections des bibliothèques universitaires canadiennes ont connu d’importantes restrictions en partie causées par la baisse du dollar canadien face au dollar américain. La plupart des frais d’abonnements aux ressources électroniques sont en dollar américain ce qui signifie que le pouvoir d’achat des bibliothèques a été significativement réduit face à la dévalorisation du dollar canadien. Cette étude utilise un sondage auprès des établissements anglophones qui sont membres du Réseau canadien de documentation pour la recherche (RCDR), un consortium canadien pour les collections, afin de mieux connaître l’impact du faible taux de change sur le développement des collections et sur la façon dont les bibliothèques s’adaptent à de nouvelles pressions budgétaires. Des bibliothécaires de 33 universités ont répondu au sondage. Parmi ceux-ci, 22 ont participé à des entrevues téléphoniques pour discuter davantage de préoccupations et d’idées concernant la crise actuelle. L’étude montre que toutes les bibliothèques participantes ont pris des mesures pour contrer l’insuffisance budgétaire incluant l’annulation d’abonnements de périodiques et de bases de données, la négociation de coûts inférieurs avec les fournisseurs, l’achat de moins de livres ainsi que la sollicitation de financement additionnel auprès de leur institution. Quoique ce stress financier causé par les fluctuations du taux de change représente un sérieux problème pour lequel il faut trouver des solutions, plusieurs répondants ont réitéré que cette réalité ne fait qu’aggraver l’inflation continue des abonnements aux ressources électroniques. Cet enjeu sérieux et persistant, qui risque de perdurer au-delà la crise du taux d’échange actuel, est le résultat d’un système de communication savante défaillant. Les bibliothécaires qui discutent avec leur communauté universitaire au sujet des budgets de collections ne devraient pas se concentrer uniquement sur le taux de change mais devraient en profiter pour explorer des alternatives au modèle de communication savante actuel. Si des solutions existent, elles se réaliseront seulement avec l’appui des professeurs et des administrateurs ainsi qu’avec la coopération entre les établissements postsecondaires et les consortiums des bibliothèques.

AB  - Summary I describe a set of automated archives for electronic communication of research information that have been operational in many fields of physics, and some related and unrelated disciplines, starting from 1991. These archives now serve over 35,000 users worldwide from over 70 countries, and process more than 70,000 electronic transactions per day. In some fields of physics, they have already supplanted traditional research journals as conveyers of both topical and archival research information. Many of the lessons learned from these systems should carry over to other fields of scholarly publication, i.e., those wherein authors are writing not for direct financial remuneration in the form of royalties, but rather primarily to communicate information (for the advancement of knowledge, with attendant benefits to their careers and professional reputations). These archives have in addition proven equally indispensable to researchers in less-developed countries.

AB  - Reading abstracts is part of the usual routine for reference librarians, especially those employed in health sciences and academic settings. The importance of abstracts to knowledge transfer and to the library and information science field is overlooked and deserves review. This book is written to fill a void in recent English-language books on this important subject. Tibor Koltay is a library and information science professor in the Faculty of Applied and Professional Arts, Szent Istvan University, Jaszbereny, Hungary. Koltay approaches the topic of abstracts and abstracting as both a literary genre and a process. The author intends the book for an interdisciplinary audience: professional abstractors, researchers who publish in scholarly journals, linguists, and language arts teachers. Librarians would also benefit from this book, especially those serving scholarly writers, researchers, and the higher education community.Koltay discusses theoretical interdisciplinary underpinnings of abstracting along with chapters on the practical skill and knowledge needed to write good abstracts. Koltay theorizes that there are three types of abstracts: the frequently used informative abstract that summarizes important methods and findings contained in the article, the indicative abstract that describes the content but does not report data in the article, and abstracts that are both indicative and informative. Librarians who love to read theoretical discussions will find much here to keep them absorbed, but the theoretical chapters can be skipped or skimmed to focus on more practical discussions, such as what exactly an abstractor has to know and what the process of writing abstracts is. A discussion of the limitations of author abstracts (those written by the author of a manuscript) versus those of professional abstractors and the connection to information literacy and database searching are among the many useful discussions.Koltay seems familiar with the North American library scene, quoting information literacy standards of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), and the use of familiar databases such as EBSCOhost's Academic Search Premier. A chapter with examples and discussion is also provided.American readers will need to adjust to British spellings and didactic style, and forge ahead through acronyms that are not always explained or found in the index. After working through these limitations, readers will find that this book contains useful, well-documented knowledge that can be used to help authors write better abstracts and can be used in teaching the scholarly publishing process. The book can be used as a self-help guide to learn the abstracting process and could be used in library and information science courses, but the cost may be prohibitive. This book is recommended for academic libraries, especially those supporting graduate programs and researchers who publish, but is optional for the typical hospital and public library.

AB  - Jadranka Stojanovski discusses the evolution of library support for open science from a Croatian perspective. From her vantage point as (former) library director of the Ruđer Bošković Institute and associate professor at the department of information science of the University of Zadar, Stojanovski has been a pioneer in establishing services exploiting the possibilities offered by new information technologies since the 1990s. Many of her activities have been connected to broad European collaborative projects such as OpenAIRE, OASPA, and EOSC.&#x0D; The Croatian approach has been a very proactive one. Already in 1997, the CROSBI was launched, a combined national scientific bibliography and repository for Green Open Access documents. Although deposition of articles and other research documents is entirely voluntary, CROSBI now carries metadata on more than 725,000 documents, a large proportion of which are available in fulltext. Alongisde CROSBI, there are also several institutions running their own institutional repositories. There is now extensive collaboration between these services in the form of DABAR (‘beaver’ in English), aiming to enhance the interoperability and findability of documents stored in the various repositories. Stojanovski has also been involved in setting up an inventory on Who’s Who in Science in Croatia as well as a database on scientific equipment, Šestar (‘pair of compasses’).&#x0D; Set up in 2005, the HRČAK (‘hamster’) platform for Croatian scientific and professional journals has been a massive success. Less than twenty years after its inception, it now carries more than 500 scholarly journals and series of conference proceedings, nearly all of which are Diamond Open Access (i.e., free to the reader and with no author-facing publishing charges). Roughly 150 of these journals receive annual subsidies from the government, the rest are fully based on voluntary work from individual editors and the institutions or learned societies they represent. Only around 25 HRČAK journals charge Article Processing Charges. The Social Sciences and Humanities are particularly well represented on the platform, with many journals publishing in Croatian despite the lack of an official language policy in favor of Croatian as a scholarly language. The University Computing Centre in Zagreb (SRCE, ‘heart’) is responsible for the technical development of HRČAK, which is based on seamless interconnection between in-house developed software and open-source software for editorial processes, primarily Open Journal Systems.&#x0D; A national Research Data Policy or, better still, a general Open Science Policy is highly desirable, Stojanovski argues. Infrastructure is in place, but usage will undoubtedly rise significantly as soon as open science practices become mandatory.&#x0D; Alongside Dominic Tate (episode 43) and Pierre Mounier (episode 44), Jadranka was a keynote speaker at the 17th Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing. This interview was first published online on December 13, 2022.

AB  - The 2014 CrossRef annual meeting and workshops were held at the Royal Society in London from November 11 to 12.They were lively and international events with over 150 attendees from many countries, including Asian countries such as Korea, China, Japan, and India.On the first day, the CrossRef workshops were held.Two parallel sessions were organized in the morning.One was for people who were new to CrossRef and the other was for those who were familiar with the technical aspects of CrossRef.Since I was new to CrossRef, I attended the beginner's session titled "Boot camp: an introduction to CrossRef." Three speakers from Cross-Ref, Carol Meyer, Anna Tolwinska, and Susan Collins, gave presentations on the general introduction of CrossRef, current tools for small publishers, and CrossCheck plagiarism screening respectively.It was a good opportunity for beginners to learn about the CrossRef organization and its products.I thought it was quite impressive that such a small organization founded just 14 years ago had grown into a very important one leading technological innovations in scholarly publishing of the world (Fig. 1).In the other parallel session, on system update, Chuck Koscher, Patricia Feeney, Mike Yalter, and Patricia Feeney gave four successive presentations with the titles "System update: an indepth and technical look at CrossRef, " "Support update and multiple resolution overview, " "DOI co-access for books, " and "Reports and how to use them." This was a technical session mainly for practitioners of the CrossRef products.The multiple resolution is about assigning multiple URLs to a single digital object identifier (DOI).It seems to be important to develop efficient tools for including books into the information space.A plenary session titled "What's new at CrossRef " was held in the afternoon.Three speakers from CrossRef gave presentations.Geoffrey Bilder gave a talk on Text and Data Mining (TDM) application programming interface (API).TDM, a beta service of which was launched in 2014, was an important keyword in this year's CrossRef meeting.I thought this was a wonderful idea that could help researchers greatly.Bilder explained that to develop a TDM API, it was necessary to have an access to full texts and license information.Then he described the TDM workflow and showed a demo.I felt that this would grow to become an important and widely-used product in the near future.In the second talk of the plenary session, Kirsty Meddings gave a presentation on new developments in CrossMark.The CrossMark logo identifies a publisher-maintained copy of a piece of content and provides important publication record information.A new development was

AB  - As scientists' means of communication and information behaviors have evolved over the past several decades due to computing and networking developments, the field of library and information science (LIS) has responded by surveying their changing practices. This study continues this type of research but switches focus away from scientists' use of journal articles, the dominant means by which research libraries have supported their investigations, and instead concentrates on scientists' practices related to data. The view of scientists as increasingly energetic generators, managers, and users of large and growing electronic datasets has lately been recognized and promoted at the societal level by funding agencies, academic societies, and large research centers. The growth in data production and storage related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research has been attributed to the development and proliferation of enabling technologies and computer networks associated with cyberinfrastructure advancement, including sensors and sensor networks, high-throughput technologies and instrumentation, automated data acquisition, and computational modeling and simulation. (NSF, 2007) While the technical and societal forces encouraging scientists to produce this born-digital content continue unabated, attention to their resulting burden of managing this content for access and use has lagged behind. LIS-trained practitioners could contribute information management infrastructure to aid scientists but this infrastructure would have to be oriented to the variety of local, idiosyncratic, field-based approaches currently extant. (Borgman, 2007) A campus-wide census of data management practices at a Carnegie Classification Research II institution identifies what the variety of faculty data management practices is across the STEM departments. LIS researchers have studied scientists to understand their information behaviors in a changing scholarly publishing environment. For instance, Brown (1999) polled faculty in four disciplines, Astronomy, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics, at her home institution to gather comparative data about their use of and attitudes about electronic versus print journal articles in relation to the academic library. Tenopir and her colleagues (2005) have teased out differences in the rate and manner that scientists in particular disciplines consume online versus print journal articles to conduct their research via multiple, sampled surveys that target a large number of members of the field's dominant academic society, and then comparing the results to other similar studies. Zhang (2001) surveyed authors of articles published in eight scholarly journals covering the LIS field to determine how Internet-based electronic resources were considered during the preparation of their articles. To help get the most out of computer-based data resulting from the increasing amount of scientific investigation facilitated through cyberinfrastructure, funding agencies in both the U.S. and the U.K. are investing in projects that develop data preservation and management tools and skills. One such effort, the Science Data Literacy (SDL) project at the iSchool at Syracuse University, has been funded by the National Science Foundation to develop a course designed to prepare students with basic knowledge and skills in science data management. In a similar manner as the earlier surveys of scientist information behaviors, the SDL staff as an early part of the project prepared a survey vehicle and conducted a census of the relevant campus faculty. The project team took a pragmatic approach in crossing disciplinary boundaries in order to gather the variety of data management practices in STEM departments across the home institution. Departments were identified that reasonably fell within the rough boundaries provided by the STEM category amalgam; SDL staff erred on the side of including the most number of researchers likely to be accumulating and working with primary datasets. In consultation with iSchool faculty practiced at survey construction, SDL staff created a survey vehicle and pilot-tested it on members of the SDL project advisory board who matched the target population. Terminology had to be negotiated and definitions provided to orient concepts from information science to the scholars' research process. For example, we eliminated the word "metadata" from the questionnaire and added an inclusive definition of data from a National Science Board report (2005) in the introduction to the survey: "any information that can be stored in digital form, including text, numbers, images, video or movies, audio, software, algorithms, equations, animations, models, simulations, etc." Demographic questions particular to the discipline-focused and hierarchical environment of the academic community were taken from the Higher Education Research Institute's faculty performance survey (2004). As per Janes' (1999) helpful advice on survey construction, this demographic data-gathering section was placed at the end. The iterative process of question phrasing and grouping led to a refined instrument designed to capture data management practices. The four-part, web-based survey featured Likert-scale agreement questions related to attitudes, practices, and experience with research data. Two provocative questions about data management in the respondent's discipline were designed not only to motivate participants to express their views, but also to help establish the presupposition of the questionnaire that the respondent was a data producer (Martin, 2006). This rather brute force technique was designed to concentrate the mind of the respondent on their data management practices, but may have had unknown effects on the target population. An initial branching question may have been more effective at weeding out members of the STEM departments who, due to a teaching, practical, or theoretical orientation, did not manage data. In the meat of the survey, branching questions also would have allowed researchers to record more than one management or preservation practice, but the instrument provided for this purpose the ability for the participant to mark multiple options per response where appropriate to simplify the survey design. Textboxes and open-ended questions in each section were meant to elicit a range of practices with data as well as overall reactions provoked by the 25 questions. Syracuse University, in combination with the symbiotically connected campus of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, has over a thousand full-time faculty members; the SDL survey was administered to 362 faculty members from STEM departments at the two institutions. Respondents received a movie ticket coupon as consideration for their time. Possible participants were identified via information posted on school and department websites and then contacted via email solicitation, notification and up to two reminders. Faculty members were given the opportunity to opt out—many did citing current retirement status or lack of involvement in research. As it was a local census using a MySQL-based token response system, anonymity was not an option, so entries are being kept in confidence and analysis is ongoing. Of those who participated resulting in a 30.7 percent response rate, problems that might affect the census results include a lack of alignment of the respondent with data-producing aspects of STEM research pursuits, such as a solely theoretical orientation in physics and mathematics, or a social orientation in the case of geography and information science. Additionally, faculty who handle different types of data per research project, faculty organized in research groups, and faculty use of research assistants as day-to-day handlers of data are conditions that may have interfered with an accurate and complete perception of data management practices from the survey responses obtained. Table 1 indicates some of the variety encountered in data management practices throughout the STEM departments. A value closer to five indicates strong agreement that the researcher responding is a frequent data producer, used data prepared by another researcher, was aware that the digital data may be used by another researcher outside his or her own group, prepared metadata of some kind for the internally produced datasets, and found metadata entries helpful when obtaining data for use from external research groups. All entries could have been the respondent answering as a representative of his or her research group. Table 2 shows the relation in responses between those researchers who work with a certain size dataset and their perception of the effect of data management practices on their discipline's progress. Researchers who operate with larger datasets appear more confident about their discipline's data management practices. Table 3 relates actions routinely taken by researchers with their data and with their agreement on the negative impact that inadequate data preservation practices are having on their discipline. It appears that researchers involved in advanced data activity such as calculation and visualization may be slightly more sanquine about their discipline's preservation practices. Continuing analysis will show the variations in management and preservation practice, according to faculty affiliation and position. This will allow mapping of local institutional attitudes and behaviors regarding data to those encouraged by major research initiatives at the disciplinary and national level. It is anticipated that results from this survey will help the SDL project team, and the LIS field more generally, understand how to integrate SDL education with STEM departments actively working with science data, as well as develop educational materials at an appropriate level to assist meeting the need for personnel with the skills and interest in science data management and preservation to support effective community and disciplinary use of these digital resources. On a more basic level, it will help provide information on how science and technology researchers obtain and manage their data as part of knowledge production and science communication processes.

AB  - Increasing the role of libraries in academic journal publishing activities and journal hosting has become an important subject in the library world in the past few years. The purpose of this study is to present the role of the libraries at University of Stavanger (UiS) in the context of library-as-publisher. Within this category, open access (OA) journal publishing has been a popular service offered by libraries, rapidly attracting researchers' attention. The University Libraries at University of Stavanger (UiS) have a long history of promoting and supporting open access initiatives. The Libraries have established and continue to build, host and maintain an operative open access institutional repository (UiS Brage) for scientific works in full text.&#x0D; From 2018, UiS libraries started using a journal management system to facilitate the open access scholarly publishing and therefore support transferring and updating of established the existing journals and the lunching of new ones. The Open Journal Systems (OJS) from Public Knowledge Project (PKP) is used which is the most common journal management system being discussed frequently in literature.&#x0D; Currently, the UiS Libraries repository host four active open access journals, with some others under development. All these journals reside within the same OJS implementation with the same design and layout on top, however, at the individual journal level there are also options for some customization.&#x0D; UiS libraries initially support all the steps of the journal creation and development process but train the editors and the subsequent users to engage in some part of the process. The library IT-Engineer and Information Technology Department (IT) manage OJS server, maintain the OJS database and software, and performs the layout and design customization and development and initial technical configuration for the new journals.&#x0D; From the viewpoint of IT, there is a need for several technical skills such as web design skills to customize the style sheets and web layout, graphic design skills to produce banners, logos and cover pages whereas the editorial workflow process may require skills on copy-editing and proofreading of articles. OJS is a template-based platform but when it comes to front-end design, it has its limitation. There are certain limitations which make it difficult to get to the details of the article. For instance, when an article comes with a long abstract or number of references, the web-page becomes unfriendly. Another challenge is when PKP launches a new OJS update. Some features cannot be migrated, and you may lose them. Furthermore, users may find it hard to adapt to the new version. The biggest challenge to the OJS is the learning curve. There are some faculty members who have had some frustrations with the software.&#x0D; While it is a free and open source platform, the time, technical skills and programming abilities are still associated with the costs. In this poster we provide you with the challenges and lessons learned so far by the libraries at Stavanger University.

AB  - Trends within universities and scholarly publishers are converging to develop tools and services to maximize the societal impacts of research. The open research agenda underpins drives to improve accessibility to knowledge, while the academic community is increasingly tasked to generate “impact” on society. With obvious synergies between these agendas, it is increasingly important for collaboration across the research ecosystem to build on this complementarity. This article reflects on, and conjects a future for, academic-publisher collaborations to connect these agendas. Les tendances au sein des universités et des éditeurs savants convergent pour développer des outils et des services permettant de maximiser les impacts sociétaux de la recherche. L’agenda de la recherche de libre accès sous-tend les efforts visant à améliorer l’accessibilité aux connaissances, tandis que la communauté universitaire est de plus en plus chargée de générer un « impact » sur la société. Compte tenu des synergies évidentes entre ces agendas, il est de plus en plus important que la collaboration au sein de l’écosystème de la recherche s’appuie sur cette complémentarité. Cet article est le fruit d’une réflexion et d’une conjecture sur l’avenir des collaborations entre les universités et les éditeurs afin de relier ces agendas. Il est rédigé conjointement par un gestionnaire de l’impact de la recherche et un chercheur universitaire (Bayley), un praticien de la mobilisation des connaissances universitaire (Phipps) et des collègues d’Emerald Publishing (Roche et Lodge).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to explain the nature of the “e‐Science’ revolution in twenty‐first century scientific research and its consequences for the library community. Design/methodology/approach The concepts of e‐Science are illustrated by a discussion of the CombeChem, eBank and SmartTea projects. The issue of open access is then discussed with reference to arXiv, PubMed Central and EPrints. The challenges these trends present to the library community are discussed in the context of the TARDis project and the University of Southampton Research Repository. Findings Increasingly academics will need to collaborate in multidisciplinary teams distributed across several sites in order to address the next generation of scientific problems. In addition, new high‐throughput devices, high‐resolution surveys and sensor networks will result in an increase in scientific data collected by several orders of magnitude. To analyze, federate and mine this data will require collaboration between scientists and computer scientists; to organize, curate and preserve this data will require collaboration between scientists and librarians. A vital part of the developing research infrastructure will be digital repositories containing both publications and data. Originality/value The paper provides a synthesis of e‐Science concepts, the question of open access to the results of scientific research, and a changing attitude towards academic publishing and communication. The paper offers a new perspective on coming demands on the library and is of special interest to librarians with strategic tasks.

AB  - See video of the presentation.The present contribution concerns a case study of open access publishing in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Greece, its history and effect in helping the local researcher community transition from a print-only mode of work to online working environments and in rendering Greek publications and scholarship more relevant to the international scholarly community. The presentation provides Greek context in scholarly communication with an emphasis on HSS; it elaborates on the goals of the project and the challenges that were encountered and addressed during its implementation. One of the main reported successes of the project is the increased awareness among Greek researchers in HSS of the capabilities and potentials of modern scholarly communication systems and the creation of a demand originating from the corresponding research communities themselves for the continuation and expansion of similar activities in the future.The project, which started in 2007 with the transition of three print journals in the humanities to an online and print format and online working environment, culminates with the development of an online platform that provides access to content and services from a single point in the web, ePublishing.ekt.gr. As part of EKT’s services, we systematize and upgrade the journals’ policies according to international standards, provide an online working platform and training, digitize and release in open access academic articles (2,555 articles in established journals, published by small, non-profit, academic/scholarly society publishers, so far), gradually provide DOIs, and concentrate (apart from articles) on books and conference proceedings but in the future we’ll also include purely online books.In a nutshell, we have focused on providing publishers of journals in HSS a range of comprehensive services which are constantly updated and improved in the light of the developments in scholarly communication, and which foster the internationalization, visibility, and preservation of research in these fields. We have also concentrated on increasing the awareness of the Humanities and the Social Science communities on open access and electronic publishing. It is worth mentioning here that the aforementioned services constitute only one of our activities relating to HSS. Another major and relevant project concerns the Greek Reference Index for Publications in the HSS, a comprehensive registry of Greek peer-reviewed journals that registers metadata, provides access to content where this is possible, and measures a variety of indicators.We continue our efforts to provide a comprehensive digital framework for HSS research in Greece, and, given that we are aiming at further expansion in our range of services and further growth in our output, we are also exploring a variety of business models that will help us achieve our goals. Particular effort will be placed in further researching the financial implications of this endeavour and choosing the appropriate business models for the future, as well as promoting awareness about digital scholarship and OA to researchers. Future plans include the intensification of our efforts to publish more e-journals and the exciting new prospect of publishing OA monographs in HSS, in collaboration with institutions in Greece and abroad.

AB  - See video of the presentation.The present contribution concerns a case study of open access publishing in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Greece, its history and effect in helping the local researcher community transition from a print-only mode of work to online working environments and in rendering Greek publications and scholarship more relevant to the international scholarly community. The presentation provides Greek context in scholarly communication with an emphasis on HSS; it elaborates on the goals of the project and the challenges that were encountered and addressed during its implementation. One of the main reported successes of the project is the increased awareness among Greek researchers in HSS of the capabilities and potentials of modern scholarly communication systems and the creation of a demand originating from the corresponding research communities themselves for the continuation and expansion of similar activities in the future.The project, which started in 2007 with the transition of three print journals in the humanities to an online and print format and online working environment, culminates with the development of an online platform that provides access to content and services from a single point in the web, ePublishing.ekt.gr. As part of EKT’s services, we systematize and upgrade the journals’ policies according to international standards, provide an online working platform and training, digitize and release in open access academic articles (2,555 articles in established journals, published by small, non-profit, academic/scholarly society publishers, so far), gradually provide DOIs, and concentrate (apart from articles) on books and conference proceedings but in the future we’ll also include purely online books.In a nutshell, we have focused on providing publishers of journals in HSS a range of comprehensive services which are constantly updated and improved in the light of the developments in scholarly communication, and which foster the internationalization, visibility, and preservation of research in these fields. We have also concentrated on increasing the awareness of the Humanities and the Social Science communities on open access and electronic publishing. It is worth mentioning here that the aforementioned services constitute only one of our activities relating to HSS. Another major and relevant project concerns the Greek Reference Index for Publications in the HSS, a comprehensive registry of Greek peer-reviewed journals that registers metadata, provides access to content where this is possible, and measures a variety of indicators.We continue our efforts to provide a comprehensive digital framework for HSS research in Greece, and, given that we are aiming at further expansion in our range of services and further growth in our output, we are also exploring a variety of business models that will help us achieve our goals. Particular effort will be placed in further researching the financial implications of this endeavour and choosing the appropriate business models for the future, as well as promoting awareness about digital scholarship and OA to researchers. Future plans include the intensification of our efforts to publish more e-journals and the exciting new prospect of publishing OA monographs in HSS, in collaboration with institutions in Greece and abroad.

AB  - Free and open access to primary biodiversity data is essential for informed decision-making to achieve conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development. However, primary biodiversity data are neither easily accessible nor discoverable. Among several impediments, one is a lack of incentives to data publishers for publishing of their data resources. One such mechanism currently lacking is recognition through conventional scholarly publication of enriched metadata, which should ensure rapid discovery of 'fit-for-use' biodiversity data resources.We review the state of the art of data discovery options and the mechanisms in place for incentivizing data publishers efforts towards easy, efficient and enhanced publishing, dissemination, sharing and re-use of biodiversity data. We propose the establishment of the 'biodiversity data paper' as one possible mechanism to offer scholarly recognition for efforts and investment by data publishers in authoring rich metadata and publishing them as citable academic papers. While detailing the benefits to data publishers, we describe the objectives, work flow and outcomes of the pilot project commissioned by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility in collaboration with scholarly publishers and pioneered by Pensoft Publishers through its journals Zookeys, PhytoKeys, MycoKeys, BioRisk, NeoBiota, Nature Conservation and the forthcoming Biodiversity Data Journal. We then debate further enhancements of the data paper beyond the pilot project and attempt to forecast the future uptake of data papers as an incentivization mechanism by the stakeholder communities.We believe that in addition to recognition for those involved in the data publishing enterprise, data papers will also expedite publishing of fit-for-use biodiversity data resources. However, uptake and establishment of the data paper as a potential mechanism of scholarly recognition requires a high degree of commitment and investment by the cross-sectional stakeholder communities.

AB  - 現在海外では科学技術医学分野における主要学術雑誌の論文はほとんどPDFとともにHTMLでオンライン公開されている。これらは内部的には各種SGMLまたはXMLで編集されているが，外部に対しては，ほとんど米国医学図書館（National Library of Medicine: NLM）が策定したNLM DTD（NLM Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite）にしたがったXMLで流通している。しかし日英混在の書誌・抄録・引用文献情報を持つわが国の多くの学術論文は，英語世界で生まれたNLM DTDで適切にXMLで表記することができなかった。筆者らはこのNLM DTDを，日本語を含む多言語に対応できるよう拡張するためのワーキング・グループSPJ（Scholarly Publishing Japan）を結成し，米国のNLM DTDワーキング・グループと連携しながら検討・提案を行った。その結果は2011年3月にNISO（National Information Standards Organization）のJATS（Journal Article Tag Suite）0.4（NLM DTD 3.1が移行）における多言語機能として公開された。本稿では，学術論文におけるSGML，XMLなどマークアップ言語の利用の歴史を振り返るとともに，SPJの活動の経緯，実現したJATS 0.4の概要について述べる。

AB  - Abstract The development of the Internet as a scholarly communication tool and the subsequent (apparent) decline of the print journal are causing great changes in historical systems of scientific communication. Not all of these changes have been positive. The two‐decades long “serials crisis” in subscriptions costs, paired with the increasing recognition that copyright management is of vital importance to the flow of information, has prompted many in scholarly communication fields to call for a sea change in how scientists formally share information. At the same time, the Internet offers novel means of transforming scholarly communication beyond the idea of the traditional journal. We are experiencing the birth pangs of this transformation now. Scientists and libraries are faced with many questions surrounding legal, social, and political issues in the scholarly sphere. These include copyright, peer review, tenure and promotion practices, cost, access versus ownership, and archiving. Speakers will discuss those issues in light of projects and new journals being published in a variety of venues, particularly evolutionary ecology and computer science research.

Here we report that, as of March 2017, Sci-Hub’s database contains 68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and 85.1% of articles published in toll access journals. We find that coverage varies by discipline and publisher, and that Sci-Hub preferentially covers popular, paywalled content. For toll access articles, we find that Sci-Hub provides greater coverage than the University of Pennsylvania, a major research university in the United States. Green open access to toll access articles via licit services, on the other hand, remains quite limited. Our interactive browser at https://greenelab.github.io/scihub allows users to explore these findings in more detail. For the first time, nearly all scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone with an Internet connection, suggesting the toll access business model may become unsustainable.

AB  - The sociotechnical context for learning and education is dynamic and makes great demands on those trying to seize the opportunities presented by emerging technologies. The goal of this paper is to explore certain theories for our plans and actions in technology-enabled learning. Although presented as a successor to previous learning theories, connectivism alone is insufficient to inform learning and its support by technology in an internetworked world. However, because of its presence in massive open online courses (MOOCs), connectivism is influential in the practice of those who take these courses and who wish to apply it in teaching and learning. Thus connectivism is perceived as relevant by its practitioners but as lacking in rigour by its critics. Five scenarios of change are presented with frameworks of different theories to explore the variety of approaches educators can take in the contexts for change and their associated research/evaluation. I argue that the choice of which theories to use depends on the scope and purposes of the intervention, the funding available to resource the research/evaluation, and the experience and philosophical stances of the researchers/practitioners.

AB  - At Johns Hopkins University, the institutional repository (IR) is being developed as a component of an overall digital library architecture that will emphasize long-term preservation. The IR represents a set of services that will be developed to support the identified needs or requirements of faculty and students. Given the research-intensive environment at Johns Hopkins, one particular area of interest relates to data sets from a diversity of disciplines ranging from the humanities to the sciences. Essentially, the IR is being developed as a “gateway” to the underlying digital archive that will support data curation as part of an evolving cyberinfrastructure featuring open, modular components. In addition to this technological framework, Johns Hopkins is developing new roles and relationships between the library and the academic community, most notably through the development of “data scientists” or “data humanists.” These developments reflect the realization that the IR is the first step in a longer journey and that for institutional efforts to be successful, they must be integrated into a larger landscape of repositories that serve a distributed and diverse academic community.

AB  - Though online journals provide a convenient way to locate a desired article, they have not yet been firmly established in the scholarly communication system. The major reason is the uncertainty of pricing schemes. We must look beyond the phenomenon of flourishing online journals to recognize the crisis in scholarly communications which has been brought about mainly by highly priced journals and we must understand the entirety of this very complicated situation. “Aggregators” “Consortia” and “SPARC by ARL” are discussed as possible means for achieving a breakthrough in the problem.

AB  - Scientific progress is built on research that is reliable, accurate, and verifiable. The methods and evidentiary reasoning that underlie scientific claims must be available for scrutiny. Like other fields, the education sciences suffer from problems such as failure to replicate, validity and generalization issues, publication bias, and high costs of access to publications—all of which are symptoms of a nontransparent approach to research. Each aspect of the scientific cycle—research design, data collection, analysis, and publication—can and should be made more transparent and accessible. Open Education Science is a set of practices designed to increase the transparency of evidentiary reasoning and access to scientific research in a domain characterized by diverse disciplinary traditions and a commitment to impact in policy and practice. Transparency and accessibility are functional imperatives that come with many benefits for the individual researcher, scientific community, and society at large—Open Education Science is the way forward.

AB  - As with other issues, it often takes a question to the Editor for which I do not have an answer to draw my attention to a matter. This is the case for the topic of this Editor's Message on supplemental materials. The Journal first started publishing supplemental materials in 2009, and there has been a steady increase in the number of published manuscripts in the Journal with supplemental materials over the past 6 years from 4% in 2009 to 31% in 2014. This increase is consistent with other journals in environmental sciences. For example, Kenyon and Sprague (2014) reported that in 2011 between 22–65% of the published articles in a subset of journals focused on biology, forestry, or fisheries were accompanied by supplemental materials. Their review of supplemental materials showed that journals publishing new research had more supplementary materials than those that published mainly reviews or meta-analyses, and that studies using coarse methods like climate change modeling or land cover mapping had fewer supplemental materials than work based on fine-scale methods such as genetic analyses despite each being data intensive. Journals that focused on short communications or were established since 2000 also had relatively high numbers of supplementary materials. The Journal of Wildlife Management guidelines (Block et al. 2011) currently indicate that “Supplemental material is manuscript information that adds depth to the manuscript but is not essential to readers' understanding of the manuscript (e.g., spreadsheets, detailed equations, video or audio files, in-depth tables and figures).” They currently differ from appendices by not being directly part of the results and in being published separately and only on-line. Supplemental materials are available to the reviewers, reviewed by the editors, and content edited by the Journal staff, but they are not copyedited or typeset so they should be considered ready for publication when the final manuscript is submitted. Wiley Blackwell, our publisher, hosts supplemental materials associated with Journal articles in an open access format, requires a formal decision by the Editor-in-Chief for their uploading, and will not add them at a later stage after acceptance (exchanges.wiley.com/blog/2004/09/01/supplementary-material/, accessed 11 Jun 2015). In the supplementary documents we require authors to entitle them as “Supplemental Materials” and to provide a date, citation for the associated manuscript, and literature cited. Supplemental materials fall under the same copyright agreement as the main article and errors found in them should be corrected via an erratum in the Journal. Our guidelines are not inconsistent with other journals, but there is high variation. In a review of journals in environmental sciences, Kenyon and Sprague (2014) reported that journal guidelines ranged from a disclaimer that the publisher of a journal (e.g., Wiley Blackwell) was not responsible for the content or functionality of supplemental materials (pointing the readers to the author for questions) to indicating that supplementary materials are expected to be of the level of quality as the articles with reviewers formally being asked whether all the materials are necessary for the article. Some journals had strict limits (5–150 MB) and placed tight restrictions on formats, whereas others accepted a wide variety of formats and file types. Some journals required a readme file for metadata, descriptions by type of file extensions, and additional text as descriptive captions, whereas others required minimal information on content. Approaches to hosting materials across journals ranged from posting on author-maintained websites to being hosted by the publisher with either open or paid access. Digital publishing indeed has extended options for submitting materials to support published articles. On-line supplemental materials allow long tables and data sets, and other graphical material to be made available that would be expensive to publish otherwise. However, as with other issues in scholarly publishing, the growing use of supplemental materials poses challenges. In 2010, the Journal of Neuroscience announced they would no longer allow authors to include or host supplemental materials (Maunsell 2010). The Editor-in-Chief, John Maunsell, initially considered the information in supplemental materials cost-effective but viewed the fact that their growth far exceeded the growth of information in articles (measured in megabytes per article) as problematic; he concluded “the sheer volume of material is adversely affecting peer review.” He argued that most reviewers are overburdened with requests to review manuscripts (see Merrill and Cox 2014) and asking them to also review supplemental materials, which often can be as extensive as the article itself, detracted from the quality of the review of the article. It also led to an “arms race” where authors submit supplemental information that may “immunize them again the reviewer's concerns.” In the past when publishing was restricted by the printed page, all materials integral to the article were printed. With the advent of electronic media that could handle multi-media, data sets, details on methods, and computer code among others items, the risk of integral materials getting detached from the article arose. Maunsell (2010) argued this undermined the principle of a “self-contained research report by providing a place for critical material to get lost.” It remains to be seen what effect the increase in availability of data repositories and more emphasis on data journals (see Merrill 2014) will have on these trends. Concerns about the long-term maintenance and regular access to supplementary materials also have been expressed. Anderson et al. (2006) in assessing biomedical journals over the period 1998–2005, found links to supplemental data maintained on publishers' websites were active in only 74% of instances. When publications sponsored by societies change publishers, such as The Wildlife Society (TWS) did in moving from Allen Press to Wiley Blackwell in 2011, access can be become problematic. Thus far, TWS has preserved the integrity to supplemental materials across publishers because articles published before 2011 directed authors to a TWS server (i.e., Table S1 at www.wildlifejournals.org) that is linked to the current publisher's website. Williams (2013) in her interviews with soil scientists also reported difficulties with accessing data due to changing file formats. Supplementary materials easily can become unreadable when new software versions no longer support obsolete file formats. Further, García-Pérez (2015) argued that on-line supplementary materials were “black holes” for citations. Based on a randomly selected sample of articles published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013, he found that references only available in the on-line supplemental materials added an additional 10% to the references cited and, with rare exceptions, they were not incorporated into citation databases. Requesting authors to produce a single list of references from the main paper and supplemental materials and posting this in the on-line version of the article as is done for articles in Science may address this issue (Hanson et al. 2011). The disarray caused by the growth in supplemental materials also poses technical challenges for librarians, abstract and indexing services, and repository administrators. Their concerns resulted in a joint initiative by the National Federation of Advanced Information Services (NFAIS) and National Information Standards Organization (NISO) in the United States to make general and technical recommendations for best practices for on-line supplemental materials (NISO and NFAIS 2013). They emphasized the conceptual division of materials into those that are integral and those that are additional to the article. As long as journals remain in print or when page charges apply, the distinction between categories may remain blurred. In any case supplemental materials need to be justified by the authors. The Journal promotes peer review of supplemental materials but recognizes reviewer overload exists. Because reviewers are likely to put less effort into supplementary materials, Associate Editors, the content editor, and Editor-in-Chief need to play pivotal roles in safeguarding their relevance and redundancy. Future standardization and emphasis on metadata in supplemental materials may be required not only to facilitate review but to simplify linkages to other digital repositories as funding agencies require more detailed data management plans. Assignment of digital object identifiers (DOI) also may assist in long-term preservation. Societies working with their publishers can promote access and discoverability in citation indexing services, and find new approaches to facilitate linkages for readers to move easily back and forth between the article and supplemental materials. As the forms of digital publishing continues to morph, effective guidance to its authors, reviewers, and editors in addressing these challenges will be key for The Society to effectively meet its mission of providing science-based research to our professional members. —Evelyn Merrill Editor-in-Chief

AB  - Die Publikationsinfrastruktur für Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen stellt sich durch die Vernetzung verschiedener OA-Publikationsworkflows mit verschiedensten beteiligten Systemen aktuell als sehr heterogen dar. Dabei werden in der wissenschaftlichen Publikationslandschaft in deren unterschiedlichsten Bereichen des Publikationsprozesses eine Vielzahl existierender Standards, Normen sowie Spezifikationen verwendet. Das vorliegende Dokument stellt in einer ersten Version eine Übersicht zu den offenen Standards im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren dar. In einer umfangreichen Recherche wurde eine große Anzahl an Standards, Normen und Spezifikationen identifiziert. Um aus der großen Masse an Standards die wesentlichen herauszufiltern, entwickelte das Forscherteam eine spezifische Arbeitsdefinition des Begriffes Standard im Kontext von Open-Access-Publikationsprozessen: „ Ein offener Standard für wissenschaftliches Publizieren beschreibt eine einheitlich dokumentierte, weithin anerkannte, vielfach angewandte, offen zugängliche und erweiterbare Spezifikation, die bei der Erstellung, Beschreibung, Herstellung und Verbreitung wissenschaftlicher Publikationen angewandt wird“. Der Überblick über offene Standards im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren umfasst in dieser ersten Version 102 Standards, Normen und Spezifikationen, gegliedert in zehn Kategorien. Darüber hinaus enthalten alle aufgeführten Standards eine direkte Verlinkung zur jeweiligen technischen Dokumentation oder zu weiterführenden Informationen. Damit stellt die Übersicht eine Grundlage für die zukünftige Diskussion und Zusammenarbeit mit Stakeholdern und der Forschungscommunity dar. Im Rahmen des vom Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) geförderten Forschungsprojektes OPEN-ACCESS-Strukturierte-Kommunikation (OA-STRUKTKOMM) wird der Überblick über offene Standards im wissenschaftlichen Publizieren entwickelt. Ziel des Projektes ist es, notwendige Werkzeuge und Strategien für die flächendeckende Einführung eines bereits entwickelten State-of-the-Art-Workflows zur Herstellung und Verbreitung von OA-Monografien (DOI 10.33968/9783966270175-00 ) zu entwickeln. Dabei soll neben dem Wissenstransfer eine XML-basierte Kommunikationsstruktur entwickelt werden, welche den Datenaustausch zwischen den workflowbeteiligten Systemen robuster und kompatibel gestaltet, um damit eine leistungsfähigere Publikationsinfrastruktur zu etablieren, diese weitestgehend zu standardisieren und so Open Access durch eine vereinfachte Nutzung attraktiver zu machen. Weitere Informationen finden sich auf der Forschungswebsite: oa-struktkomm.htwk-leipzig.de Translated Abstract The publication infrastructure for Open Access publications is currently very heterogeneous due to the networking of various OA publication workflows with a wide range of systems involved. In the scientific publication landscape, a large number of existing standards and specifications are used in the various areas of the publication process. The first version of this document provides an overview of open standards in scientific publishing. In an extensive research a large number of standards and specifications were identified. In order to filter out the essential ones from the large mass of standards, the research team developed a specific working definition of the term standard in the context of open access publishing processes: "An open standard for scholarly publishing describes a uniformly documented, widely accepted, widely used, openly accessible, and extensible specification that is applied to the creation, description, production, and dissemination of scholarly publications." In this first version, the overview of open standards in scientific publishing includes 102 standards and specifications, organized into ten categories. In addition, all listed standards contain a direct link to the respective technical documentation or to further information. Thus, the overview provides a basis for future discussion and collaboration with stakeholders and the research community. Within the research project OPEN-ACCESS-Structured-Communication (OA-STRUKTKOMM) , funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the overview of open standards in scientific publishing is being developed. The aim of the project is to develop the necessary tools and strategies for the widespread introduction of an already developed state-of-the-art workflow for the production and dissemination of OA monographs (DOI 10.33968/9783966270175-00 ). In addition to knowledge transfer, a XML-based communication structure is to be developed that will make data exchange between the systems involved in the workflow more robust and compatible. The aim is to make the publication infrastructure more efficient, standardize it as far as possible and make Open Access more attractive by simplifying its use.

AB  - Much of the widespread poverty, environmental desecration, and waste of human life seen around the globe could be prevented by known (to humanity as a whole) technologies, many of which are simply not available to those that need it. This lack of access to critical information for sustainable development is directly responsible for a morally and ethically unacceptable level of human suffering and death. A solution to this general problem is the concept of open source appropriate technology or OSAT, which refers to technologies that provide for sustainable development while being designed in the same fashion as free and open source software. OSAT is made up of technologies that are easily and economically utilized from readily available resources by local communities to meet their needs and must meet the boundary conditions set by environmental, cultural, economic, and educational resource constraints of the local community. This paper explores both the open source and appropriate technology aspects of OSAT to create a paradigm, in which anyone can both learn how to make and use needed technologies free of intellectual property concerns. At the same time, anyone can also add to the collective open source knowledge ecosystem or knowledge commons by contributing ideas, designs, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It is argued that if OSAT continues to grow and takes hold globally creating a vibrant virtual community to share technology plans and experiences, a new technological revolution built on a dispersed network of innovators working together to create a just sustainable world is possible.

AB  - The difference between the advanced and developing countries in the matter of access to information for research has been continually increasing. The advent of the Internet and electronic sources of information has not only exacerbated the gap but also led to the exclusion of developing country researchers from taking part as equal partners in publishing, refereeing, and in international collaboration. If handled imaginatively, the very same technologies can help bridge the information gap between the rich and the poor countries and help improve research productivity worldwide. Many initiatives that are already in place are described and suggestions are given on steps to be taken by developing country researchers.

AB  - The role of librarians in the development and promotion of institutional repositories is discussed. It is presented as a continuation of their existing functions of acquiring, organising and making readily available the resources needed by academic staff and students. Library staff are collaborating with IT staff and academics to disseminate scholarly material and learning objects emanating from their institutions. The Open Archives Initiative and its Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, which provide the technical structure to support the repositories and enable their interoperability for searching purposes, are discussed. The benefits to institutions and their staffs are also reported. The skills needed by library staff are outlined, as well as the pitfalls and problems they may face in persuading academic staff of the virtues of institutional repositories.

AB  - The mechanisms used for scholarly publishing have remained largely unchanged over time, even as we’ve moved from a print-based world to a digital world. The scholarly communication ecosystem, however, is now undergoing a period of rapid transformation, including the introduction of new actors, new services, and increased pressure to improve the means of scholarly communication in order to meet the growing expectations of an information-rich world. Where to begin? The first question is to ask how scholarly publishing can provide the greatest benefit to global society in a sustainable way. Our two-day conversation about this question led us to the conclusion that the “black box,” monolithic model of scholarly publishing no longer serves most researchers. The most sustainable approach that best responds to the needs of authors and researchers today, and that may also pose the least amount of risk in completely disrupting the system, is disaggregated services—unbundling the products and services that publishers currently provide and letting market forces drive the development of, and demand for, a new and improved à la carte world of knowledge artifacts and knowledge management tools.OSI2016 Workshop QuestionWhat do we mean by publishing in today’s world? What should be the goals of scholarly publishing? What are the ideals to which scholarly publishing should aspire? What roles might scholarly publishers have in the future? What scenarios exist where publishers continue to play a vital role but information moves more freely? What impact might these reforms have on the health of publishers? Scholarly societies? Science research? Why?

AB  - Introduction Lewis G. Liu (bio) The scholarly publishing market plays a critical role in modern societies since it communicates research findings to researchers, businesses, and industries. Scientific research findings are expected to lead to innovations, inventions, and new products and services that are driving forces of countries' economic growth and development. Research findings in social sciences and business are expected to provide policy guidance for improving individuals' lives and organizational effectiveness and efficiency of businesses, nonprofit institutions, and government agencies. Academic libraries have always been part of the scholarly publishing market since they represent the demand side of the market equilibrium and play an important role in acquiring, maintaining, and delivering scholarly publications. The changes in the scholarly publishing market such as price increases for packaged journal subscriptions and ebooks can have an impact on academic libraries' budgets, and therefore affect their collections and acquisitions policies and decisions. While inflation is a factor in price increases, the oligopoly behavior of a few large commercial publishers can be a cause of price increases in journal and book prices. In fact, commercial publishers have been reshaping the scholarly publishing industry in recent decades and continue to expand their presence as a dominant force in today's scholarly publishing market, whereas the presence of noncommercial publishers, particularly the presence of university presses, has been diminishing, and some of them have been consolidated into library operations (Clement 2011) to achieve economies of scope. Commercial publishers control a larger share of scholarly information products, including print books, ebooks, open access journals, and research databases. The lack of competition in the scholarly publishing market can only lead to increased prices for these information products. It is not uncommon to see a few large corporations dominating an industry in the current global [End Page 183] economic system. They hire workers to make products, and then sell them to consumers who usually are not part of the production process. What is unique in the scholarly publishing market is that scholarly content creators are also consumers of their own products and their institutions have to buy back the very creations of their own research, in many cases at a higher price than they are willing and able to pay. In this Library Trends volume, we have gathered academic researchers, practicing librarians, and library administrators who have research expertise and working experiences in their respective subject areas to examine the role and impact of commercial and noncommercial publishers in scholarly publishing on academic libraries. Given the time constraint to complete this research project and maximum total pages allowed, we are not able to address as many topics as we would like. We, however, have covered some important issues related to the theme of this Library Trends volume. Scholarly publishing mainly consists of journal and book publishing. Although consumers, providers, and content creators of scholarly journals and books are more or less the same groups of individuals and organizations, journals and books are different types of information products. Journals are demanded in a more timely manner than are books. Researchers need the most recent research results from their fellow researchers to update their own research. Journals in general are more expensive than books partly because the timely demand for journals drives up their prices. Therefore, journals and books belong to separate information markets and will be discussed as such. The Scholarly Journal Publishing Market and Academic Libraries 1989 Studies and the Collapse of the Scholarly Journal Market The scholarly journal publishing market had been more or less in equilibrium until the late 1980s when many academic libraries' budgets could no longer keep up with escalating journal prices charged by commercial publishers and started canceling journal subscriptions. Nationwide complaints about escalating journal prices prompted the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) to investigate the issue. The ARL commissioned Economic Consulting Services, Inc. (1989) to conduct an economic cost analysis of journals published by a few major commercial publishers in the fields of science, technology, and medicine. The conclusion was that journal prices charged by these commercial publishers were much higher than their costs and inflation, revealing excessive profit made by commercial publishers. In the very same...

AB  - Scientific research activity is reaching a staggering growth rate, introducing new and compounding existing challenges regarding the quality of peer-review, rise of predatory journals, and larger issues involving academic integrity and fraud stemming from the increased pressure to publish. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is well-suited to address some of the challenges specific to scientific publishing. Companies including ARTiFACTS, Pluto, Orvium, and ScienceMatters-EUREKA, along with academic researchers, are exploring blockchain-based solutions to facilitate research data provenance and workflows, optimize the peer-review process, introduce better incentives, and even create new research journals and platforms utilizing blockchain. Building upon a review of these efforts, we propose a governance framework for scientific publishing based on a consortium blockchain model to create a more efficient means of navigating the publishing process. At the center of this framework is a model that adopts shared governance and validated inclusion via a Democratic Autonomous Organization (DAO). A DAO is an entity wherein the organizational rules are implemented and executed via smart contracts. The DAO will be comprised of participants of validated individuals and organizations who are publishers, editors, peer-reviewers, and citizen scientists to manage and oversee the framework. The framework also maps specifically to the publication workflow of submitting, handling, peer-review, and final editorial decision-making for scientific manuscripts. The goal of this framework is to increase transparency of scientific publishing, create a "pedigree" of a manuscript's research life cycle, and democratize the publication process while maintaining the accepted workflow common to scientific publishing by journals.

AB  - Abstract Web citations have been proposed as comparable to, even replacements for, bibliographic citations, notably in assessing the academic impact of work in promotion and tenure decisions. We compared bibliographic and Web citations to articles in 46 journals in library and information science. For most journals (57%), Web citations correlated significantly with both bibliographic citations listed in the Social Sciences Citation Index and the ISI's Journal Impact Factor. Many of the Web citations represented intellectual impact, coming from other papers posted on the Web (30%) or from class readings lists (12%). Web citation counts were typically higher than bibliographic citation counts for the same article. Journals with more Web citations tended to have Web sites that provided tables of contents on the Web, while less cited journals did not have such publicity. The number of Web citations to journal articles increased from 1992 to 1997.

AB  - Purpose The paper's purpose is to share the insights that the staff of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Libraries (Wallace Library, RIT Archives, and the Cary Collection) gained into the role of reference librarians in establishing and operating an institutional repository (IR). Design/methodology/approach The paper conducts a literature review on a range of published (1999‐2005) works to research the background of IRs and to incorporate it with the authors' own experiences. Findings The research findings, involving implementing IRs and specifically the effect on the role of the reference librarian in academic libraries, were found to be not as extensive as expected. Originality/value This paper is intended for those who are involved in developing and promoting IRs. The outcome of the paper is to stimulate thought and to contribute to the dialog on the topic of how IRs impact reference librarian roles and careers.

AB  - University libraries worldwide are reconceptualising the ways in which they support the research agenda in their respective institutions. This paper is based on a survey completed by member libraries of the Queensland University Libraries Office of Cooperation (QUL OC), the findings of which may be informative for other university libraries. After briefly examining major emerging trends in research support, the paper discusses the results of the survey specifically focussing on support for researchers and the research agenda in their institutions. All responding libraries offer a high level of research support, however, eResearch support, in general, and research data management support, in particular, have the highest variance among the libraries, and signal possible areas for growth. Areas for follow-up, benchmarking and development are suggested.

AB  - Web-based platforms play an increasingly important role in managing and sharing research data of all types and sizes. This article presents a case study of the data storage, sharing, and management platform Figshare. We argue that such platforms are displacing and reconfiguring the infrastructure of norms, technologies, and institutions that underlies traditional scholarly communication. Using a theoretical framework that combines infrastructure studies with platform studies, we show that Figshare leverages the platform logic of core and complementary components to re-integrate a presently splintered scholarly infrastructure. By means of this logic, platforms may provide the path to bring data inside a scholarly communication system still optimized mainly for text publications. Yet the platform strategy also risks turning over critical scientific functions to private firms whose longevity, openness, and corporate goals remain uncertain. It may amplify the existing trend of splintering infrastructures, with attendant effects on equity of service.

AB  - This paper describes the scholarly metadata collected and made available by Crossref, as well as its importance in the scholarly research ecosystem. Containing over 106 million records and expanding at an average rate of 11% a year, Crossref’s metadata has become one of the major sources of scholarly data for publishers, authors, librarians, funders, and researchers. The metadata set consists of 13 content types, including not only traditional types, such as journals and conference papers, but also data sets, reports, preprints, peer reviews, and grants. The metadata is not limited to basic publication metadata, but can also include abstracts and links to full text, funding and license information, citation links, and the information about corrections, updates, retractions, etc. This scale and breadth make Crossref a valuable source for research in scientometrics, including measuring the growth and impact of science and understanding new trends in scholarly communications. The metadata is available through a number of APIs, including REST API and OAI-PMH. In this paper, we describe the kind of metadata that Crossref provides and how it is collected and curated. We also look at Crossref’s role in the research ecosystem and trends in metadata curation over the years, including the evolution of its citation data provision. We summarize the research used in Crossref’s metadata and describe plans that will improve metadata quality and retrieval in the future.

AB  - Peer review is the formal means by which the scientific community assesses the originality, reproducibility, validity, and quality of a research study (Bakker and Traniello 2019). As such, peer review assures nonexperts that they can trust a study's findings (Jamieson et al. 2019). Despite the critical importance of peer review, graduate students, postdocs, and other early career researchers (ECRs) have limited resources for learning about this process (but see Nicholas and Gordon 2011 and Nature Communications 2021). A recent survey found that most reviewers have not received formal training on peer review and that reviewers of all career stages (77%), especially ECRs (89%), desire further training (Warne 2016). This reflects a need for guidance regarding when and how to engage in peer review, best practices for conducting a peer review, and how editors weigh peer reviews in their editorial decisions. In an effort to help new reviewers navigate this process, we (the Raelyn Cole Editorial Fellows) hosted an Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) webinar on peer review in September of 2021 (recording available: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utntl1VGy5g). The webinar had 329 registrants, including 198 students or postdocs, underscoring the desire for peer review resources. The webinar content was largely based on a survey of the associate editors (AEs) of ASLO's three peer-reviewed journals (n = 25 respondents), consisting of five open-ended questions about peer review. Here, we use insights from our survey and webinar to describe how ECRs can join the reviewer pool, provide guidance for writing a useful and time-efficient review, and discuss challenges and opportunities in the evolving landscape of peer review. Peer review begins when an AE sends invitations to potential reviewers. We asked the ASLO AEs how they select reviewers and most said they usually use one reviewer suggested by the authors. Other strategies include using the reviewer list within the ScholarOne submission website, conducting an internet search, selecting based on the AE's knowledge of experts in the field, and selecting a reviewer from the manuscript reference list. Many AEs also try to solicit diverse reviewers in terms of career stage, nationality, gender, etc. Many AEs noted the growing challenge of finding willing reviewers. Jeffrey Krause, AE for Limnology and Oceanography Letters, noted, "I typically don't have issues with finding people to request reviews from. However, getting them to accept is another challenge—my record is somewhere around 11 declines for a review for a single manuscript." This comment reflects a trend in scholarly publishing: the proportion of reviewer invitations leading to a submitted review is declining (Fox et al. 2017; Publons 2018; Bakker and Traniello 2019). Consequently, editors must send a growing number of reviewer invitations per manuscript, ultimately increasing the time to an editorial decision. This trend is often attributed to "reviewer fatigue" (reviewers now being asked to review more manuscripts) and may reflect faster growth in article submissions than growth of the reviewer pool. One way to address reviewer fatigue/shortage is to recruit more reviewers from the underutilized ECR pool. Some AEs already intentionally solicit reviews from ECRs. "PhD students might have insights on cutting-edge topics that are lost on senior scientists," wrote David Baker, AE for Limnology and Oceanography. Reviewing benefits ECRs: it broadens their knowledge, provides insights for improving their own manuscripts, is recognized as a form of service, and opens doors to other editorial opportunities (Schiermeier 2016; Poulson-Ellestad et al. 2020). However, some ECRs are unsure about their qualifications to review. One of the most common questions asked by webinar registrants was: "How do I know if I have the experience needed to review?" After the webinar, we sent a second survey to ASLO AEs, asking a single question: "What qualifies one to be a peer reviewer?" The most common answers indicated that reviewer selections are based on subject area expertise and publication record (Fig. 1a). Notably, holding a Ph.D. was only mentioned by three respondents, suggesting that editors welcome reviews from ECRs who have the necessary expertise and publication experience. So, how can ECRs get involved in peer review? One option is joint-peer-review, in which an ECR reviews a manuscript together with their mentor or advisor (Schiermeier 2016). All ASLO journals support this practice; invited reviewers simply notify the Editor in Chief (EIC) of their plan to conduct a joint-peer-review. This notification is critical given that confidentiality is always a top priority of peer review. Alternatively, senior scientists may provide names of ECRs as alternate reviewers when they cannot review a manuscript themselves. Finally, we encourage ECRs to contact editors of the journals for which they wish to review (via email or at a conference or other networking opportunity) and express their interest in reviewing. Any ECRs interested in reviewing for the ASLO journals may add their name to the association's ECR reviewer database (https://forms.gle/KvbmyTzrVgHKpw9x9). This database, updated periodically, is available to AEs on the dashboard from which they invite reviewers. Reviews are written both for editors and for authors: they help the former make sound editorial decisions and guide the latter on how to improve their manuscript. We asked AEs what makes a review useful, and their answers reflected these two purposes (Fig. 1b). The most common answer was that a useful review argues why a paper should be published or not, describing its strengths and weaknesses. The why argument is critical for editors and is important for both positive and negative reviews. For instance, many editors noted that they often side with the better-argued position when two reviewers disagree on their recommendation (e.g., one suggests a revision and the other suggests a rejection). This is consistent with recent work showing that AEs value the key issues identified by reviewers more than the reviewer's overall recommendation (Falkenberg and Soranno 2018). The second most common answer from AEs was that a useful review explains how the authors can improve their manuscript (Fig. 1b). "The review process should more often be about, 'how can this manuscript be improved' rather than 'how can this manuscript be taken down'," said David Antoine, AE for Limnology and Oceanography. AEs also said that useful reviews explain how the manuscript moves the field forward, describe any major issues or fatal flaws, include specific (not vague) comments, and use a polite tone. To the latter point, it may be useful to write your review, set it aside for a few days, and re-read it before submitting to ensure that your comments are appropriate and professional. Finally, it helps AEs when reviewers describe their own background and expertise. "It is a collegial approach to recognize the limits of knowledge as a reviewer," said George Waldbusser, AE for Limnology and Oceanography: Methods. Reviewers are not expected to be experts on all aspects of the manuscript and describing the limits of your expertise can help the AE weigh the review and/or reconcile conflicting reviews. Another important aspect of peer review is time efficiency. We asked webinar participants how long they typically spend reviewing a manuscript. The most common answer was 4–8 h, but some participants answered that they spend >12 h on a review. When asked how long to spend on a review, Paul Kemp (EIC of Limnology and Oceanography: Methods) said that reviewers should invest the time and effort needed to produce the type of review they themselves would like to receive—a truly helpful review. "Everyone has their own process for reviewing," Paul said, and one should spend whatever time it takes to produce a useful review. "But," he added, "with practice, you get faster!" Nevertheless, there are strategies to save time when reviewing manuscripts (Table 1). We suggest that reviewers use a two- or three-read strategy, in which a quick initial read is used to identify major problems (Nicholas and Gordon 2011). If the reviewer finds a fatal flaw or a major shortcoming after their first read, they can explain the problem, including strong justification for its severity, and need not provide a full review (Table 1). It is also appropriate to contact the AE at this stage if you realize you are not well-suited to review or if the manuscript is unintelligible. The latter includes problems with language and grammar that make it difficult to understand and evaluate the scientific content. If the manuscript is intelligible and publishable in principle, you should read it a second (and optionally, third) time for detail and draft your review. In this case, you can save time by making general comments about recurring problems (Table 1). "A few examples of consistent problems is enough to make your point. It's not your job to rewrite the paper," said Kelly Benoit-Bird, AE for Limnology and Oceanography. When commenting on grammar and linguistic precision, be aware of the disadvantages faced by non-native English-speaking authors (Clavero 2010; Ramírez-Castañeda 2020) and that being a native English speaker is not synonymous with being a good writer (Romero-Olivares 2019). The cost of professional English editing services can be a significant financial barrier for researchers from the Global South (Ramírez-Castañeda 2020). While many universities offer scientific writing assistance or graduate-student-led writing groups, assistance with English language editing often falls on favors from peers (Ramírez-Castañeda 2020). Kind and constructive feedback from a peer reviewer, such as pointing out sentences where the meaning is unclear, can be helpful; however, a reviewer's primary role is to assess scientific merit and not to fix grammatical errors. Ultimately, some researchers are calling for institutional changes to properly address linguistic injustice, such as modifying publication charges to redistribute the costs of professional English editing services so that all the financial burden does not fall on non-native English speakers (Clavero 2010; Ramírez-Castañeda 2020). Engaging more ECRs in peer review can address several current challenges in scientific publishing. ECRs can (1) expand the existing reviewer pool, (2) bring diverse perspectives to review, and (3) support positive peer review ethics. The high turnout for our webinar suggests that ECRs are interested in and motivated to participate in peer review, but many are unsure about whether they are qualified to contribute. Feedback from AEs suggests that ECRs can begin reviewing shortly after they begin to publish. We stress the importance of connecting AEs with this emerging pool of reviewers and the key role that senior scientists can play in training and advocating for ECR reviewers through joint-peer-review and suggesting ECRs as alternate reviewers. ASLO is an international society, and our peer review webinar was attended by participants from 29 countries, including 11 countries from the Global South. This global interest shows promise in diversifying the peer reviewer pool. Peer review activities are currently imbalanced across countries; for instance, researchers from the United States perform more peer reviews per article published than researchers from China (Warne 2016; Publons 2018). Furthermore, willingness to review appears higher among scholars from emerging research-output regions (such as China, Taiwan, Poland, and Brazil) than in those from established regions (such as the United States; Publons 2018). This high willingness to review persists despite language barriers for non-native English speakers, which can present challenges for authors and reviewers alike. While non-native English-speaking ECRs may be intimidated or feel unqualified to serve as peer reviewers (Ramírez-Castañeda 2020), it may be especially beneficial to their professional development to start reviewing early and often. In fact, a survey of ASLO editors showed that non-native English speakers tended to assume the role of AE after obtaining more peer review experience than their native English-speaking colleagues (Poulson-Ellestad et al. 2020). Attracting and training more reviewers from different countries can also grow the reviewer pool and bring new, diverse perspectives to reviews. Finally, we hope that efforts by ECRs to learn about the peer review process will instill positive peer review ethics. This means treating authors the way you would like to be treated (e.g., the 'golden rule'; McPeek et al. 2009) by responding as soon as possible after receiving a review request (so as to not delay the process), reviewing 2–3 manuscripts for every paper you submit as a first author, and maintaining a professional and respectful tone in your written review. Peer review is the backbone of scientific publication; thus, constructively engaging the next generation of peer reviewers is integral to the progression of science. We thank the AEs of the ASLO journals for their thoughtful responses to our survey. We also thank Jim Cloern, Anya Metcalfe, Rita Franco-Santos, Alejandra Sanchos-Rios, and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback on this editorial. Finally, we thank the ASLO EICs and our partners at Wiley, Fiona Sarne and Mia Ricci, for their help in orchestrating the webinar upon which some of this editorial is based.

AB  - Digital technologies, combined with library expertise in information management and bibliographic control, access, dissemination and preservation, have provided new opportunities for academic libraries to play a more active role in the publication of scholarly information. Over the past decade a number of Australian academic libraries, drawing on early initiatives in North American libraries, have established electronic presses in their institutions. This article examines the motivations behind these initiatives and their similarities and differences, and identifies some of the ways in which library-led e-publishing may change the scholarly communication environment.

AB  - Open access publishing is now an accepted method of scholarly communication. However, the greatest traction for open access publishing thus far has been in the sciences. Penetration of open access publishing has been much slower among the social sciences. This study surveys 309 authors from recent issues of open access journals in education to determine why they choose to publish in open access journals and to gain insight into the ways publishing practices within the discipline itself impact the willingness of authors to engage in open access publishing.

AB  - This article characterizes key weaknesses in the ability of current digital libraries to support scholarly inquiry, and as a way to address these, proposes computational services grounded in semiformal models of the naturalistic argumentation commonly found in research literatures. It is argued that a design priority is to balance formal expressiveness with usability, making it critical to coevolve the modeling scheme with appropriate user interfaces for argument construction and analysis. We specify the requirements for an argument modeling scheme for use by untrained researchers and describe the resulting ontology, contrasting it with other domain modeling and semantic web approaches, before discussing passive and intelligent user interfaces designed to support analysts in the construction, navigation, and analysis of scholarly argument structures in a Web-based environment. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We are an electronic resources librarian and a systems librarian, and in the course of our research on unaffiliated users and academic libraries, we continued to identify and be stymied by trends in vendor technologies, systems, sales models, and products that caused concern. We hope to share these concerns, summarize the landscape, and also provide some advice on possibilities for collective action as we move forward.

AB  - Consider for a moment the rate of advancement in the scientific understanding of DNA. It is formidable; from Fredrich Miescher’s nuclein extraction in the 1860s to Rosalind Franklin’s double helix X-ray in the 1950s to revolutionary next-generation sequencing in the late 2000s. Now consider the scientific paper, the medium used to describe and publish these advances. How is the scientific paper advancing to meet the needs of those who generate and use scientific information? We review four essential qualities for the scientific paper of the future: ( i) a robust source of trustworthy information that remains peer reviewed and is ( ii) communicated to diverse users in diverse ways, ( iii) open access, and ( iv) has a measurable impact beyond Impact Factor. Since its inception, scientific literature has proliferated. We discuss the continuation and expansion of practices already in place including: freely accessible data and analytical code, living research and reviews, changes to peer review to improve representation of under-represented groups, plain language summaries, preprint servers, evidence-informed decision-making, and altmetrics.

AB  - This article is based on a keynote address given at the ACM Digital Libraries '99 conference, held in Berkeley, CA, in August 1999. It is reprinted with slight modifications by the kind permission of the author and the publisher from D-Lib Magazine , v. 6, no. 1 (January 2000). "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" Alice asks the Cheshire Cat who is perched on the bough of a tree. "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," is the cat's saucy reply. Which way ought we to go in digital library research and development? This too depends on where we want to get to. But in this case who is we ? Where are we trying to get to? And how have we come to decide that this where (whatever it is) is where we ought to be? These are the millennial, the big picture questions I want to pose to the digital library community as the calendar turns. My hope, as the title of these remarks suggests, is to introduce and reflect on the problem of purpose in digital libraries. The term is due to Patrick Williams, who in The American Public Library and the Problem of Purpose [4], documents the various attempts of American public libraries over the past nearly 150 years to identify and solidify their purpose – to figure out where they were trying to get to. I'll start by reviewing the problem of purpose in American public libraries and American academic/research libraries before turning to digital libraries. The first American public library, in Boston, was inaugurated in 1854 with a strong statement of purpose: "Why should not this prosperous and liberal city extend some reasonable amount of aid to the foundation and support of a noble public library, to which the young people of both sexes, when they leave the schools, can resort for those works which pertain to general culture, or which are needful for research into any branch of knowledge? . . . We consider that a large public library is of the utmost importance as the means of completing our system of public education . . ." Other public libraries were soon created in this image; by 1875 nearly 200 public libraries had been established and even more were being planned. Their mission was clear: to serve as a new kind of educational institution, an adjunct to the public school, which would provide citizens with ongoing opportunities to learn after they had completed their formal schooling. There was just one problem with this noble purpose: patrons of the libraries seemed more interested in reading popular literature (mainly fiction) than the "serious" works (history, biography, science) that educators of the time thought would lead to moral and intellectual growth. Librarians comforted themselves by inventing a "taste-elevation theory." Even if patrons came to the library in search of fiction, they would eventually move on to works of greater merit. But by the 1890s the taste-elevation theory had been largely abandoned. People still wanted popular fiction, and there was no evidence that they were cultivating a taste for more cultured works. As the taste-elevation theory lost adherents, the debate grew about what to do: Exclude inferior fiction? Accept entertainment as having social value? Permit whatever the public wanted? It came to be accepted that public libraries should supply readers with what they wanted, entertainment mostly. But this meant that the original stated purpose of the public library, to be an educational institution on a par with the public schools, to provide "self-culture through books," would have to be abandoned. This was only the first in a series of discouragements as public libraries invented or discovered new purposes only to abandon them once they were found to be wrong or inadequate. Around the turn of the century, a time of rapidly changing social conditions, librarians re-envisioned themselves as "missionaries of literature," teaching the American way of life. Enlivened by "the library spirit," a faith in the transformative potential of reading, librarians set forth to "evangelize, reform, and save." The outbreak of World War I put an end to this vision. "Librarians cannot prevent the breakdown of civilization," one prominent librarian said in 1913. Other missions followed, some of them seeming like vaguely recycled versions of previous attempts: the public library as an all-purpose information center, as a community center, as a center for adult education, as the guardian of free speech – all with limited success. It wasn't until the 1980s, Williams claims, that public libraries finally began to come to terms with their more limited but realistic purpose: to be suppliers of books to the middle class and a symbol of culture in the community. Williams' book was published in 1988, however, too early to see that the Internet would once again challenge the public library's sense of purpose or to see libraries trying to fashion themselves into portals onto the information superhighway. For much of their history, by contrast, academic and research libraries have lived with a happier and more successful sense of purpose. The modern academic library, like the public library, was a product of the 19th century. But unlike the public library, it was lucky enough to inherit a purpose from the larger institution within which it was created. As Stanley Chodorow and Peter Lyman explain [2], the modern university defined itself as "an instrument for social progress," and scholarship as "the production of specialized publication." With this understanding, the university took upon itself an obligation "to collect and organize the information that its faculty and students needed for their work." A division of responsibility was worked out between faculty, academic presses and academic libraries. The faculty would be the producers and, along with students, the consumers of scholarly information. The academic presses would produce physical volumes – books and journals – while assuring the quality of the intellectual content. Academic libraries would take responsibility for purchasing, organizing, preserving and providing access to scholarly information. This worked reasonably well until, in the last decade or two, the cost of journal subscriptions offered by commercial publishers began to spiral out of control. In the face of rising prices, academic libraries began to prune their subscriptions, and in response to lost subscriptions, journal publishers raised their subscription prices even higher. At the same time, higher journal prices left libraries with less money to spend on monographs, so these collections began to suffer as well. The result was a crisis of purpose which still hasn't been resolved: How can academic and research libraries continue to fulfill their original purpose – to collect, organize and provide access to scholarly information – when they can't afford to acquire it? All this took place before the Internet exploded onto the scene. But now, in an increasingly wired world, it is possible that universities may be able to take back control of scholarly information. By working with scholarly societies to create their own online journals they may be able to cut commercial publishers out of the loop. While this holds out some hope for resolving the crisis in scholarly publishing, it doesn't necessarily help libraries, which also risk being cut out of the loop. Even worse, digital developments may challenge academic libraries even more fundamentally. What happens to the very idea of the university in an age in which distance learning is not only conceivable but seemingly practical? And what role is there, if any, for academic libraries when so much information is becoming available on the Web? As many observers have pointed out, the term digital library means different things to different people. For librarians, the word library conjures up an institution that manages one or more collections. For computer scientists, the institutional aspect plays a minor role, if any. Instead, this group is more likely to focus on the collections themselves – digital collections – and on the enabling technologies through which these collections are built and searched. Do digital libraries now, or will they eventually, suffer a problem of purpose? It might seem hard to imagine such a possibility, especially at a time of such enormous expansion and optimism in the digital realm. But I want to suggest that the problem of purpose deserves our further attention and that attending to it can actually help chart an expanded and more focused research agenda for digital libraries. At first, it might seem that purpose is simply irrelevant to digital libraries. Especially if we think of them as enabling technologies with which to create and manage collections of digital materials, then digital libraries would seem to be purpose-neutral. But this simply shifts the problem of purpose from the technologies, per se, to the collections and the institutions that manage them. We're still left needing to say something about the purpose(s) of these institutions and their collections. And if we should choose to argue that digital libraries can be all things to all people, we ought at least to pay attention to public libraries, which tried that route and failed. Purpose, however, clearly is relevant to digital libraries, in whatever way we conceive of them. Indeed, I would argue that researchers and funders currently have a shared purpose, a mission, which stretches from research and development through to the greater good of humankind and provides psychic energy and justification for the current research agenda. This mission, which might be called the digital library faith, is an almost evangelical belief that digital materials are right and good. I think it goes something like this: Why are we doing digital library research and development? To put digital materials online so they can be found and used. And why are we doing this? To make these materials more broadly, quickly and efficiently accessible. Why? Because information is good, so more information is better. Why? For the sake of democracy, education, the advancement of science and technology. Why? For the sake of the "good life": freedom, health, ethical conduct, wisdom, well-being. It would seem hard to argue with a statement of purpose as well-intentioned and self-evidently good as this. It has the aura of Mom and apple pie, truth and justice, and the American Way. Still, I think it has its difficulties and deserves to be debated and fine-tuned. Here are three directions for further exploration. First, although it is implicit in my formulation of the digital library faith, many members of the community believe that we are headed for, and should be headed for, an all-digital world. One has only to look at the current research agenda in the large to see a near total emphasis on managing all-digital collections. But "all-digital, all the time" is an article of faith. It may ultimately come to pass, but like the various apocalyptic prophesies which run wild at a time like ours, it simply isn't supported by the current facts. Ethnographic studies of actual workplaces reveal the diverse mix of materials, digital and otherwise, commonly in use and offer no suggestion that this diversity is diminishing. By hewing to an agenda enlivened by this faith, I believe we are missing some important research opportunities, such as integrating heterogeneous (digital and non-digital) collections and providing tools to organize and search them. Second, our almost religious belief in the power of information deserves to be examined. Is more information always better? Surely not. Just look at the growing concern over invasion of privacy as online services are collecting more and more information about consumers. Or the glut of junk mail and, now, spam. In such cases fixes can be envisioned, part technological, part social and political. But other criticisms of our current information focus may not be so easily addressed. Albert Borgmann, for example, a philosopher of technology, has been arguing that a steady diet of high tech information resources, of travels in cyberspace, risks distorting our relationship to reality, depriving us of other, much needed sources of wisdom (our bodies, our relationship to the earth, silence). "Information," he claims in his latest book, Holding On to Reality [1], "is about to overflow and suffocate reality." Surely, if more information isn't always better, then the link between information and the good life deserves closer attention. My third point has less to do with the particulars of the digital library faith than with the communities that have been shaping it. In her cultural and architectural history, Free to All: Carnegie Libraries and American Culture, 1890-1920 [3], Abigail Van Slyck argues that each public library funded through Andrew Carnegie's philanthropy was the product of interactions among multiple, local constituencies. "Carnegie libraries," she says, "stood on contested ground. Despite their strong family resemblance, they were not the unselfconscious expression of a unified American spirit. Instead, they were always cultural artifacts whose meanings varied with the intentions and experiences of a diverse group of users." Librarians, architects, the members of the town council (who were men) and the women of the community all brought different perspectives to bear. Under such circumstances of conflicting perspectives and objectives, even Carnegie's money wasn't powerful enough to determine how each library would be realized. Slyck's somewhat surprising conclusion is that "ultimately, Carnegie's importance lay in initiating substantive discussion about the role that culture should play in modern America." The current digital library agenda has largely been set by the computer science community and clearly bears the imprint of this community's interests and vision. But there are other constituencies whose voices need to be heard. We have an opportunity, as yet unrealized, to debate our purposes with a broader spectrum of the population whose lives will be affected by the work we do. Social scientists, for example, have much to say about the relationship between technological development and the societal benefits that might accrue from it. To date, however, the social science work within digital library R&D has largely been defined as, and confined to, evaluating prototypes developed by computer scientists. Then too, stronger participation from the traditional library community seems essential. And had it been available earlier, such participation might have helped us avoid the most glaring omission of the first decade of digital library research and development: the lack of attention to preservation. It is only in the last few years that the enormity of the preservation problem has begun to become generally known, and research that might help resolve it is still very much in its infancy. For roughly a decade we have been rushing to put materials online with no thought to (and no idea of how to) preserve them. One consequence is that, almost certainly, there will be a hole in history: the early history of the Web will have been missed. Surely, this must count as an illustration of how narrowness of vision can take its toll and how more explicit attention to societal purposes can help expand and tune a research agenda. Libraries, digital or otherwise, carry a strong symbolic charge. On the face of it, they are just one element in the larger circuit through which information travels from production to ultimate consumption. In this respect, they are on a par with the other elements in the circuit: authors, publishers, distributors and communities of users. But libraries have come to symbolize and to exemplify the values we impute to the entire circuit. What we say about digital libraries and how we understand them embodies and signals our attitude toward the place of information in our culture. To this extent, it is potentially of great consequence not only how we construct digital libraries but how we talk about them and whom we include in the conversation. "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" Alice asks the Cheshire Cat. "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," the Cat replies. "I don't much care where –" Alice says. "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," the Cat replies. "– so long as I get somewhere," Alice adds. "Oh, you're sure to do that," says the Cat, "if you only walk long enough." Here is where the parallel between Alice in Wonderland and digital libraries ends. For those of us involved in digital library research and development care very much about where we're trying to get to. Whether, or however, we articulate it, most of us are greatly concerned with the societal consequences of the work we do. It is my belief that more explicit attention to this direction – and a broader, more inclusive debate about it – will lead to a stronger and more focused research agenda.

AB  - Studies documenting the usage patterns of electronic journals have compared print and e-journal characteristics, surveyed faculty for their perceptions and expectations, and analyzed the impact on library practices. This study, a qualitative exploration of a wide array of issues related to the research and teaching habits of early adopters of e-journals in a research setting, was conducted in the spring of 2001 with faculty in the basic and health sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Open-ended questionnaires provided a framework to wide-ranging discussions of perceptions, expectations, and changing practices pertaining to e-journals and other electronic resources. The results were analyzed with a specific focus on shared behaviors and values, discipline-dependent variations, and changing research and teaching habits. Several challenges for library resources and services are identified and discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper examines changing research practices in the digital environment. A review of the literature and our own field research in Australia suggest that there is a new mode of knowledge production emerging, changing research practices and bringing new information access and dissemination needs. Adjustments will be required to accommodate these changes, but new opportunities are emerging for more cost‐effective and sustainable information access and dissemination. It will be necessary, however, to take an holistic approach and treat the creation, production and distribution of scholarly information, the management of information rights and access, systems of review and evaluation and the underlying infrastructure as parts of a single research information and scholarly communication system.

AB  - The internet is rapidly becoming the first place for researchers to publish documents, but at present they receive little support in searching, tracking, analysing or debating concepts in a literature from scholarly perspectives. This paper describes the design rationale and implementation of ScholOnto, an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse. It enables researchers to describe and debate via a semantic network the contributions a document makes, and its relationship to the literature. The paper discusses the computational services that an ontology-based server supports, alternative user interfaces to support interaction with a large semantic network, usability issues associated with knowledge formalisation, new work practices that could emerge, and related work.

AB  - Social media has become an integral part of our day-to-day lives. From the early days of chat rooms, MySpace, Friendster, and AOL Instant Messenger, to the countless modern apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram available today, social media has evolved from a basic way to chat with others of similar interests into a viable and effective tool to enhance communication at a professional level. This column will address social media and its use in scholarly publishing, starting with this first column, which will examine whether you and/or your organization want to amplify your group’s messages with one or more of today’s sophisticated social media tools. The first thing you should know about me is that I love my job. As the Managing Editor of The Plant Cell and Plant Physiology at the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB), I love every single thing about my role: overseeing production and peer review, working closely with our extremely capable vendors, figuring out tricky style questions, facilitating the day-to-day operations of our editorial boards, and so much more. However, there has been an unexpectedly delightful and rewarding aspect of my job that has become a passion of mine: social media and using it to promote our authors, our editors, our society, and the plant biology community. Also, social media has played a crucial role in building relationships with my scholarly publishing peers. The ways I use social media professionally continue to evolve and expand in ways I could never have envisioned when […]

AB  - Purpose This paper proposes describing how reference librarians in an academic library recruit content for its institutional repository, and how their roles have been changed in the process. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes the background on how institutional repositories have developed in response to the open access movement. The case of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Institutional Repository is described in detail, showing different strategies that reference librarians employed in recruiting content. The strategies include encouraging researchers to self‐archive papers, scanning web sites, capturing pre‐existing collections of grey literature, and downloading from open access sources. Findings The paper illustrates how the roles of reference librarians are changed in the process of building the institutional repository. There are extensions of existing roles in terms of system evaluation, advocacy and reference services. Brand new roles include content recruitment and interpreting publishers' policies. It also points out possible directions which can make the repository sustainable. Practical implications The paper provides a very useful case study to which other academic libraries may refer when they plan to develop their own institutional repositories. Originality/value This paper provides in‐depth descriptions on the changing roles of reference librarians not covered in previous literature. Discussions on policies, strategies, barriers and challenges will have reference value for academic libraries who want to embark on a similar project.

AB  - Abstract Institutional repositories are “digital collections that capture and preserve the intellectual output of universities” (Crow, 2002 ). While still in their initial stages of development, much attention has been paid to the technical and administrative components. This paper examines the usability of the interfaces of two of the most commonly used institutional repository systems: DSpace and Eprints. By using heuristic evaluation and usability testing, eighteen undergraduate students were tested using a between subjects experimental design. Measures included time for completing tasks, the number of errors, and users' satisfaction from post‐test questionnaires. Results of the study indicated that DSpace users spent less time completing tasks and made fewer errors than Eprints users. Overall satisfaction of DSpace was also higher than Eprints. Based on this analysis of problem areas, the study suggests guidelines for institutional repository interfaces.

AB  - What does it cost to make a high quality, digital monograph? What may sound like an obvious question turns out to be a very knotty one, driving to the heart of the essence of scholarly publishing today. It is particularly relevant in an environment where the potential of a sustainable open access (OA) business model for monographs is being explored. Two complementary studies funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2015 have explored this question to understand the costs involved in creating and disseminating scholarly books.

AB  - ABSTRACT Academic libraries should be considered research tools, co‐evolving with technology. The Internet has changed the way science is communicated and hence also the role of libraries. It has made it possible for researchers to provide open access (OA) (i.e. toll‐free, full‐text, online access, web‐wide) to their peer‐reviewed journal articles in two different ways: (i) by publishing in them in OA journals, and (ii) by publishing them in non‐OA journals but also self‐archiving them in their institutional OA archives. Librarians are researchers' best allies in both of these strategies. Examples of these strategies are described. We conclude that an official mandate for OA provision is necessary to accelerate its growth and thereby the growth of research usage and impact worldwide.

AB  - This year's theme of International Open Access Week was Open for Collaboration, and centered on the political and legal gains open access communities have made worldwide. Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition has been the major organizer of Open Access week since its beginnings in 2007. The world-wide participation of so many different communities in this event, which was celebrated on every continent except Antarctica, shows that the issue of open access, which a few years ago was mainly a concern of the U.S. academic community, now has international backing and is shaping how scientific research will be disseminated in the future.

AB  - As open access to research information grows and publisher business models adapt accordingly, knowledge infrastructure has become the new frontier for advocates of open science. This paper argues that the time has come for universities and other knowledge institutions to assume a larger role in mitigating the risks that arise from ongoing consolidation in research infrastructure, including the privatization of community platforms, commercial control of analytics solutions, and other market-driven trends in scientific and scholarly publishing.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the purpose, methods, and selected results of a study of faculty work practices, especially as they bear on the creation, location, and use of grey literature and the design and use of institutional repositories. Design/methodology/approach Based on a work‐practice study of faculty members and researchers at the University of Rochester. The methodology used videotaped interviews to record and analyze how participants accomplish such tasks as using web‐based research and writing tools, organizing books and papers, and staying current. Findings Reviews six key research findings related to the understandings and attitudes faculty members hold regarding institutional repositories and the role of librarians in developing institutional repository collections. Explains why librarians have found it difficult to attract faculty participation from the perspective of user needs and work practices. Research limitations/implications The study is based on field research with a small number of participants in six departments across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Access to faculty participants was limited. Practical implications Recommends new strategies for institutional repository design, recruitment of content, and outreach by librarians based on the six key research findings. Proposes an expanded role for librarians as liaisons to faculty who wish to share their work using the library's repository system. Originality/value The paper presents original research that addresses a current problem in the area of institutional repositories: why faculty members have not taken full advantage of new technologies that help them share their work. It lists the practical steps that librarians can take to improve faculty participation in repository projects and to increase access to grey literature for all scholars.

AB  - ABSTRACT ‘Communities’ has become a buzzword in the strategy departments of publishing companies. It is clear – and becoming clearer – that the Internet is not merely a potential information delivery route but a vehicle for bringing together communities. One of the problems, however, is that much of the scholarly activity on the Web is driven by people with a traditional information delivery role – writers, publishers, booksellers and subscription agents and librarians. Nobody questions the importance of these roles but community creation is different and requires skills which are frequently closer to caterers or advertising agencies or hoteliers. Time will tell how communities will develop. Whatever happens it is clear that the world of scholarly publishing is going to change beyond recognition in the next decade – and most of that change is for the better.

AB  - The Government of Ireland has set a target of achieving 100% open access to publicly funded scholarly publications by 2030. As a key element of achieving this objective, the PublishOA.ie project was established to evaluate the feasibility of establishing an all-island [Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland] digital publishing platform for Diamond Open Access journals and monographs designed to advance best practice and meet the needs of authors, readers, publishers, and research funding organisations in Irish scholarly publishing. It should be noted in this context that there is substantial ‘north–south’ cooperation between public bodies in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, some of whom operate on what is commonly termed an ‘all-island’ basis. The project commenced in November 2022 and will run until November 2024, with the submission of a Final Report. This article originated as an interim project report presented in September 2023 at the PubMet2023 conference in Zadar, Croatia. The project is unique in its mandate to report on the feasibility of a shared platform that will encompass scholarly publishing across the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, which are now, post-Brexit, inside and outside the European Union (EU): the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. The project is co-led by the Royal Irish Academy (RIA), Ireland’s leading body of experts in the Sciences and Humanities, and the Trinity Long Room Hub Arts &amp; Humanities Research Institute of Trinity College Dublin. There are sixteen partners and affiliates from universities and organisations from the island of Ireland. The feasibility study will be based on a review of the publishing practices in the island of Ireland, with gap analysis on standards, technology, processes, copyright practices, and funding models for Diamond OA, benchmarking against other national platforms, and specifications of the requirements, leading to the delivery of a pilot national publishing platform. A set of demonstrator journals and monographs will be published using the platform, which will be actively trialled by the partner publishers and authors. PublishOA.ie aims to deliver an evidence-based understanding of Irish scholarly publishing and of the requirements of publishers to transition in whole or in part to Diamond OA. This paper provides an interim report on progress on the project as of September 2023, ten months after its commencement.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Institutional repositories (IRs) provide colleges and universities a way to ensure stability of access to and dissemination of digital scholarly communications. Yet, many institutions report that faculty willingness to contribute to IRs is often limited. This study investigates faculty attitudes about IR contributions by tenure status and category of material. METHODS Two focus group interviews were conducted in the spring of 2009 among English department faculty at a large Midwestern university. One group consisted of tenured faculty and the other of tenure-track and adjunct faculty. RESULTS Both groups recognize the benefit of open access to research materials but expressed concern about their intellectual property rights. Untenured faculty spoke more about nonprint research. Both groups also shared concerns about contributing instructional materials, primarily in regard to plagiarism and outdated materials. In regard to faculty service, the tenured group discussed many items they would contribute, while the untenured faculty mentioned very little. DISCUSSION Some minor differences emerged related to experience and tenure status in regard to contributing research and instructional artifacts, but the major variation was the strong support tenured participants gave for contributing service items, compared to the untenured faculty, who did not view this category positively. Tenured faculty viewed the IR as a way to document their own service activities, investigate those of colleagues, and had fewer concerns about plagiarism or other negative effects in the service category. CONCLUSION Promoting faculty contribution of service-related items to an IR may be a way to encourage larger numbers to participate.

In fact, there is no standard document format.

AB  - Purpose Many open source software packages are available for organizations and individuals to create digital libraries (DLs). However, a simple to use instrument to evaluate these DL software packages does not exist. The objectives of the present work are to develop a checklist for DL evaluation and use this checklist on four DL software packages. Design/methodology/approach Features that characterized “good” open source DL software were determined from the literature. First identified were essential categories of features that DL software should possess. These categories were then decomposed into supporting features. From these, a checklist that covered all such features was developed. The checklist was then used to evaluate four popular open source DL software packages (CDSware, EPrints, Fedora, and Greenstone) for the purposes of assessing suitability for use in a DL project to be undertaken by the authors. Findings A checklist consisting of 12 categories of items was developed. Using this, Greenstone was found to be the best performer, followed by CDSware, Fedora and EPrints. Greenstone was the only software package that consistently fulfilled the majority of the criteria in many of the checklist categories. In contrast, EPrints was the worst performer due to its poor support for certain features deemed important in our checklist, and a total absence of functionality in other categories. Originality/value The present work attempts to develop a comprehensive checklist for assessing DLs. Its flexibility allows users to tailor it to accommodate new categories, items and weighting schemes to reflect the needs of different DL implementations.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Web has evolved as a hypertext environment whose value is derived from a simple ability to link resources together. The advanced linking features of some early hypertext systems might be implemented in the Web in various ways. The Semantic Web is one aspect of the continuing evolution of the Web which may be of value to the evolution of scholarly publishing and research, and may enable publishers to justify investment in the future. The key advantages are the ability to unlock value from the existing scholarly literature by enabling innovation in research tools; further encouraging the creation of a marketplace of services of value to the publishing industry; and ensuring that websites and content are well integrated into the Web as it exists now and in the future.

AB  - This paper summarizes the 18th Academic Publishing in Europe (APE) Conference: Berlin Re-Visited: Building Technological Support for Scholarship and Scientific Publishing, held as a hybrid event 10 and 11 January 2023, and organized by the Berlin Institute of Scholarly Publishing (BISP), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing publishers, researchers, funders, and policymakers together. This year’s conference theme “Out with the old, in with the new!” was discussed and presented in keynote speeches, the APE lecture, and several panel discussions. Current challenges within scholarly publishing, e.g., with research integrity, trust, and research assessment, have much to do with the old ways of doing things. To move science forward, new technologies and innovations, like the decentralized web, FAIR digital objects, and blockchain technology are needed to shape new paradigms. In many sessions it was stressed that not just new technologies are needed to move science forward, but human collaboration and partnerships as well. The changing role of the journal and the importance to recognize more diverse research outputs, beyond the journal article, was a topic of importance. Not only research assessment reforms and improved collaboration amongst different stakeholder groups are needed to address this, new publishing systems, better metadata, and open infrastructures as well. A session presenting different start-ups showcased how Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and software technology can be used to tackle problems in e.g., finding relevant funders and peer reviewers, and detecting image plagiarism. It was also discussed what publishers can do to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Collaboration, data transparency and sharing best practices amongst researchers, funders, and policy makers are key. Another important topic during this year’s APE was how publishers can support Early Career Researchers: establishing new workflows and infrastructures that enable publication of a wider range of research outputs, and broader recognition of these outputs, will incentivize ECRs. This year’s APE was concluded with the APE Award Ceremony. The winner - Vsevolod Solovyov from Prophy - has used AI to enhance the current peer review system and made a very important contribution to improving the scholarly communication system.

AB  - The AI hype cycle has come for scholarly publishing. This essay argues that the industry’s feverishーif mostly aspirationalーembrace of artificial intelligence should be read as the latest installment of an ongoing campaign. Led by Elsevier, commercial publishers have, for about a decade, layered a second business on top of their legacy publishing operations. That business is to mine and process scholars’ works and behavior into prediction products, sold back to universities and research agencies. This article focuses on an offshoot of the big firms’ surveillance-publishing businesses: the post-ChatGPT imperative to profit from troves of proprietary “training data,” to make new AI products andーthe essay predictsーto license academic papers and scholars’ tracked behavior to big technology companies. The article points to the potential knowledge effects of AI models in academia: Products and models are poised to serve as knowledge arbitrators, by picking winners and losers according to what they makevisible. I also cite potential knock-on effects, including incentives for publishers to roll back open access (OA) and new restrictions on researchers’ access to the open web. The article concludes with a call for a coordinated campaign of advocacy and consciousness-raising, paired with high-quality, in-depth studies of publisher data harvestingーbuilt on the premise that another scholarly-publishing world is possible. There are many good reasons to restore custody to the academy, the essay argues. The latest is to stop our work from fueling the publishers’ AI profits.

AB  - At first sight the “big (or all‐you‐can‐eat) deal” seems excellent value for libraries and their users, and represents the shining possibilities of the electronic age. A more thorough‐going evaluation, however, exposes dangers for universities, their funders and publishers. This paper examines the big deal in the light of fundamental market conditions and suggests alternative models for procuring electronic resources. The roles and strengths of the players in the information supply chain are defined and traditional hard‐copy procurement is analysed in terms of these roles and the concepts of authority, branding and monopoly. The fundamentals of procuring electronic resources and prevalent purchasing models are discussed in terms of the same roles and concepts. The advantages of the big deal are laid out ‐ access to resources, low unit costs etc. The dangers are also discussed. These arise mainly from the publishers’ position as monopolists. The possible long‐term effects, on library budgets and academic publishing, of dealing with monopoly suppliers are examined. Means of avoiding or minimising these dangers – consortia, alternative publishing methods, new economic models to promote competition – are examined.

AB  - Existing systems, which are based on peer review, formal publication and surrender of copyright and characterised by increases in volume and costs, and lack of competition, are an obstacle to scholarly communication. Through a joint approach by all participants in the communication process, it may be possible to find a solution to the problems. Such a solution will probably require a blend of co-operation and competition in order to remove the current monopoly power.

AB  - OAIster, at the University of Michigan, University Libraries, Digital Library Production Service (DLPS), is an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant‐funded project designed to test the feasibility of using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI‐PMH) to harvest digital object metadata from multiple and varied digital object repositories and develop a service to allow end‐users to access that metadata. This article describes in‐depth the development of our system to harvest, store, transform the metadata into Digital Library eXtension Service (DLXS) Bibliographic Class format, build indexes and make the metadata searchable through an interface using the XPAT search engine. Results of the testing of our service and statistics on usage are reported, as well as the issues that we have encountered during our harvesting and transformation operations. The article closes by discussing the future improvements and potential of OAIster and the OAI‐PMH protocol.

AB  - This opinion piece argues that the time finally seems right to truly embrace innovation in the academic publishing market and review the role of large commercial publishers therein.It argues that many innovations already exist but have thus far failed to truly disrupt the status quo due to the omission of due consideration being given to the broader role of scholarly communications within the wider research ecosystem and an inability to compete with the least tangible of publishers' value propositions: prestige.It does this by conducting two analyses: a stakeholder power/impact matrix to ascertain all who have an interest in the scholarly publishing process and their primary motivations, and an exploration of the value conferred by commercial publishers to the publication process.It concludes with a call to bring together all impacted stakeholders to issue a declaration on fair publishing and a commitment to change.A collective approach, united by a common purpose, can lead to real change for a better, more equitable future.

AB  - The wide application of digital technologies to scholarly communications has disrupted the model of academic library service that has been in place for the past century. Given the new Internet tools and the explosive growth of digital content available on the Web, it is now not entirely clear what an academic library should be. This article is an attempt to provide a strategy for academic libraries in what is left of the first quarter of the 21st century. There are five components of the model: 1) complete the migration from print to electronic collections; 2) retire legacy print collections; 3) redevelop library space; 4) reposition library and information tools, resources, and expertise; and 5) migrate the focus of collections from purchasing materials to curating content. Each of the components of the strategy and their interactions will be considered. It is hoped that the result will provide a useful roadmap for academic libraries and the campuses they serve.

AB  - In response to rising tuition, state disinvestment, and financial uncertainty over the years, open educational resources (OER) have been introduced as a solution to address the college affordability crisis (Colvard et al., 2018). The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) sees OER as not just a way to lift the financial burden of educational materials, but also as a path to improving teaching and learning, strengthening the economy, advancing societal goals, and breaking down barriers to education (SPARC, n.d.-b). State policymakers have created grant programs or other initiatives to incentivize the creation, use, or expansion of OER in an effort to decrease costs associated with postsecondary education. This raises the question of how state policy discourse defines the problem that then informs the solutions addressed in OER legislation and how introducing an equity discourse into OER policy making can strengthen efforts to remove barriers to higher education.

AB  - Objective – To identify and examine the factors of library publishing services that facilitate scholarly communication.&#x0D; &#x0D; Design – Analysis of library publishing service programs.&#x0D; &#x0D; Setting – North American research libraries.&#x0D; &#x0D; Subjects – Eight research libraries selected from the signatories for the Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity (COPE) Cornell University Library’s Center for Innovative Publishing; Dartmouth College Library’s Digital Publishing Program and Scholars Portal Project; MIT Libraries’ Office of Scholarly Publishing and Licensing; Columbia University Libraries’ Center for Digital Research and Scholarship; University of Michigan Library’s Scholarly Publishing Office; Duke University Library’s Office of Scholarly Communications; University of Calgary Libraries and Cultural Resources’ Centre for Scholarly Communication; and Simon Fraser University Library’s Scholarly Publishing.&#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – The authors used Roosendaal and Geurt’s (1997) four functions of scholarly communication to analyze and categorize library publishing services provided by libraries included in the study. The four functions of scholarly communication include registration, certification, awareness, and archiving.&#x0D; &#x0D; Main Results – Analysis of the registration functions provided by library publishing services in this study revealed three types of facilitating factors: intellectual property, licensing, and publishing. These include services such as repositories for digital scholarly work and research, ISBN/ISSN registration, and digital publishing. Analysis of archiving functions demonstrated that most programs in the study focus on repository-related services in support of digital content preservation of papers, datasets, technical reports, etc. Analysis of certification functions provided by these services exposed a focus on expert review and research support. These include services like professional assessment of information sources, consultation on appropriate literature and information-seeking tools, and writing or copyright advisory services. Analysis of awareness function showed search aids and knowledge-sharing platforms to be the main facilitating factors. These include services like metadata application, schema, and standards or scholarly portals enabling knowledge-sharing among scholars.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion – This study identified several services offered by these library publishing programs which can be categorized as facilitators under Roosendaal and Geurt’s (1997) four functions of scholarly communication. The majority of the libraries in the study treated library publishing services as part of broader scholarly communication units or initiatives. Digital publishing (registration function) was offered by all programs analyzed in the study, while traditional peer-review services (certification function) were not. Widely adopted among programs in the study were the use of social networking tools (awareness function) and self-publishing (archiving function). The authors recommend developing services that facilitate peer review and assert the need to provide a knowledge-sharing mechanism within the academic community that facilitates the scholarly communication process.

AB  - Key points Around 30% of campus‐based members of the Association of American University Presses now report to libraries, more than double the number 5 years ago. Beyond reporting relationships, physical collocation and joint strategic planning characterize the most integrated press/library partnerships. The main mutual advantages of deep press/library collaboration are economic efficiency, greater relevance to parent institutions, and an increased capacity to engage with the changing needs of authors in the digital age. There is emerging interest in collaboration at scale among libraries and presses that may extend the impact of press/library collaboration beyond single institutions.

AB  - This is a brief report on a pilot project funded by the European Commission TEMPUS programme concerned with the modernisation of the university libraries in Syria and the enhanced visibility of the research outputs of the Syrian academic community. As background, it outlines the current state of the country's electronic and scholarly publishing, and the development of national and university computer networks. It reviews the project's contribution to introduction of automated library management systems with online catalogues and institutional repositories, and the expansion of journal collections. The issues likely to impact on further developments are discussed. Aspects of current professional education, including a shortage of qualified librarians with contemporary professional knowledge and skills, inhibit development. Other major challenges are the lack of effective strategic planning and poor management systems.

AB  - L ibrary publishing programs have the potential to be a critical component of the community-controlled infrastructure pushing the scholarly publishing landscape toward more open and equitable practices. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that long-term preservation is particularly problematic for open access publications, 1 and the products of library publishing programs are unfortunately not immune. While preservation is a significant challenge for small publishing programs generally, in many ways library publishers are in a better position to meet it than their non-library-affiliated peers. Libraries have long been centers for preservation and have invested in individuals, tools, and partnerships that are at the forefront of the preservation effort. Yet the expertise available in libraries often seems disconnected from the library publishing practitioners who could benefit from it.

AB  - Abstract From a fledgling technology with no proven business models, electronic books (e-books) have grown in importance usurping traditional formats as an acquisitions budget line in many academic library contexts. Business models include purchase, subscription, and pay per use. In academic and research libraries, web based e-book delivery is the dominant platform involving desktop, Netbook and iPad user agents. E-books are the hot property of today’s academic library, forming the new wave in information services along with web scale discovery and institutional repositories. This paper reports the results of a preliminary analysis of transactional e-log data describing academic and student use of Ebook Library (EBL) titles at Edith Cowan University (ECU) Library, Perth, Western Australia. The data mined and analysed encompassing Semesters One and Two of the 2010 academic year. Analysis includes descriptive statistics and other metrics describing e-book usage patterns and user behaviour. The paper compares usage patterns observed with earlier studies and reports on the phenomenon of the ‘power user’.

AB  - L'accés obert (AO) en el sector de l'ensenyament superior a Austràlia ha experimentat una evolució ràpida. Aquest article revisa els avenços en dues àrees relacionades: l'AO a les publicacions de recerca científica, i a les dades obertes. D'una banda, l'AO pot esdevenir un suport als recursos educatius oberts (REO) en la mesura que proporciona accés a la recerca per a l'aprenentatge i l'ensenyament. D'altra banda, un ampli ventall d'actors (que inclou universitats, els seus principals òrgans, organismes públics de finançament de la recerca i altres organitzacions i xarxes que es concentren explícitament en l'AO) es mostren cada vegada més actius en aquests àmbits de diferents maneres. L'AO convida a canviar l' statu quo en tot el sector de l'ensenyament superior, i l'impuls i el dinamisme actuals en aquesta àrea suggereixen que es continuaran produint canvis ràpids i rellevants en el context de l'AO en un futur previsible. Aquest article identifica i analitza també les pràctiques generals, les polítiques i els canvis culturals i les infraestructures derivats de l'evolució de l'AO en l'ensenyament superior a Austràlia, i acaba plantejant diverses qüestions clau relatives al futur de les pràctiques i polítiques en matèria de dades obertes i de recerca d'AO a Austràlia en un marc de creixent interès per l'AO a escala internacional.

AB  - ABSTRACT Responses from almost 1,250 academic authors around the world were analysed to obtain their views on electronic publishing of learned journals. Currently, having a print version of journals is still more important to them than an electronic version. The issue of greatest importance to authors and readers is the continuing availability of back volumes, and there are strong concerns about pricing of electronic journals. The potential gains in publication speed through publishing electronically appear not to be a priority. Electronic preprint and reprint archives are used very little at present, with the exception of the physics and mathematics communities. Of all publisher‐mediated tasks, the peer‐review process is the most valued, followed by provision of citation‐linking. Respondents' views of future developments in electronic publishing are also explored.

AB  - Open infrastructure is foundational to the conduct of open research, and repositories are a key component of open research infrastructure, providing an avenue for the open dissemination of research outputs. Repositories also play a crucial role in increasing equity of access and supporting compliance with funder policies for open access. The U.S. Repository Network (USRN) seeks to support the nation’s open research repositories in cementing their position as an essential component of our national research infrastructure. In summer 2021, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) announced its partnership with the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) to catalyze a US repository network and its intention to hire a visiting program officer to lead that work. I was lucky enough to secure that role and began work in September 2021.

AB  - The rise of digital repositories is helping libraries reinvent themselves. The benefits to libraries and universities creating institutional repositories (IRs) are great as libraries restructure, pursue collaborations, and re-position themselves to become major digital publishers and broadcasters in the scholarly world. They will no longer be passive receivers of information but active disseminators of intellectual output for entire universities. This article explores the IR's role in overall library transformation and examines the organizational changes and internal partnerships necessary to strengthen IR programs. Specifically, the creation of digital library initiatives units as well as changes to other library units are discussed.

AB  - Article discussing how we pay for scholarly publishing. Since at least the late 1970s, when stresses in the market for scholarly literature began to show, there have been calls to redistribute how the production and dissemination of scholarly literature are paid for. The motivations are addressing the free rider problem of institutions without presses and, more recently, increasing overall access to the literature. In particular, the last few years have seen schemes such as SCOAP3 and Knowledge Unlatched and proposals from K | N Consultants and a joint task force of the Association of Research Libraries and the American Association of Universities. These plans to establish new business models are summarized.

AB  - In February, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) released a memo directing each US funding agency with over $100 million in annual research expenditure to develop a plan to support public access to the results of research funded by the federal government, including results published in scholarly journals. How has the OSTP memo impacted scholarly publishing so far? What exactly has been achieved so far, and what will it mean for the future of U.S.-published research? This interactive session features a panel of speakers who will be discussing the recent developments and emerging issues from the librarian, funder, researcher, and publisher perspectives. Among the questions to be addressed are:

AB  - In 2007, 65% of ARL members were reported to be either offering or developing publishing services (Hahn, 2008). A new survey, conducted by Purdue University, Georgia Tech, and University of Utah Libraries as part of an IMLS-funded research project, suggests that almost 80% of ARL members are now offering publishing services and that this is also an active area of interest in Oberlin Group (liberal arts college) and medium-sized institutions. It also provides a richer picture of an increasingly mature area of academic library service provision, well aligned with issues of emerging roles and new models of scholarly communication. This session reports on this important year-long research project surveying the state of "library publishing services" in 2011 and examines the challenges and opportunities library publishers face in the areas of technological infrastructure, skills and processes, and organization and sustainability. Attendees can expect to: learn about the opportunities of becoming involved in providing publishing services from within the library; get practical tips on growing existing programs from librarians active in this space; and receive some honest assessments of the challenges institutions involved in this area of new entrepreneurship have faced and how they have overcome them.

AB  - The African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development (AJFAND), is among the very few internationally renowned peer reviewed journals published in Africa. It was launched in August 2001, as the African Journal of Food and Nutritional Sciences (AJFNS) as a pilot project of the Rural Outreach Programme (ROP) by Hon Prof. Ruth Oniang’o. Its aim was to provide a platform, through which food and nutrition issues and information concerning Africa, and its unique problems could be effectively addressed and disseminated. A second objective of the journal was to provide a capacity building facility in scholarly publishing for budding African scholars. It became evident that these issues were also very closely linked to agriculture and human development in Africa. In recognition of this close linkage, the name of the journal was changed to African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development (AJFAND).

AB  - According to the policies of a number of indexing database agencies and the Principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly publishing 3rd version, archiving of scholarly journal articles is mandatory for editors and publishers.Furthermore, publishers in Korea have been required to deposit journal article files in the National Library of Korea since February 2016 by law.This study presents background information on archiving sites and how to deposit digital files in the Library's archive.Although some archiving sites for scholarly journals have been developed internationally, it may be burdensome for publishers in Korea (almost all of which are academic societies) to use those sites to deposit digital files because a deposit fee is required by some agencies.Furthermore, PubMed Central, maintained by the United States National Library of Medicine, accepts only English-language biomedical journals.In contrast, it is possible for publishers to deposit articles in the National Library of Korea by uploading files without any fees, regardless of the journal language.Furthermore, publishers can select the access policy of their journals.All journal publishers and editors in Korea are recommended to utilize the archiving site of the National Library of Korea to preserve their journal articles.

AB  - &lt;p class="3"&gt;This article provides an overview of the current state of repositories of open educational resources (ROER) in higher education at international level. It analyses a series of educational indicators to determine whether ROER can meet the specific needs of the education context, and to clarify understanding of the reuse of open educational resources (OER) provided by ROER. The aim of the study is to assess ROER by combining these two perspectives, and to form a basis for discussion among the universities that are responsible for these repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="3"&gt;The method was based on content analysis and consisted of two phases: an exploration of international sources, and an analysis of 110 ROER using the proposed set of indicators. The results focus on data from the analysis of ROER websites and some models of good practices. They are presented according to three core dimensions for evaluating ROER: general factors to establish types of ROER, a focus on drivers for OER reuse, and a focus on educational aspects. It was found that most of the ROER that included one or more of the proposed reuse indicators were created exclusively for educational resources. Educational aspects are not yet firmly embedded into ROER. The few repositories that seem to have successfully included them are those that provide other educational metadata and use educational standards.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - SUMMARY In dealing with the “serials crisis” over the years, librarians have often called upon faculty authors and editors in other disciplines to be more “responsible” in their publishing behaviors by, for example, not working with journals that routinely engage in sizable increases in subscription prices. The issuance of Declaring Independence: A Guide to Creating Community Controlled Science Journals by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) and the Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN) in 2001 provided Chaffin with a framework for comparison of journals in library and information science with those in other disciplines more commonly cited as culprits in producing the “serials crisis.” Comparisons of three years of data on annual subscription prices in journals, copyright policies, and use of alternate publishing models for library and information science, physics, and sociology revealed no significant differences in journals by disciplinary fields. The finding that librarians and information scientists behaved no better than those in field commonly cited for behaving “irresponsibly” prompted both the title of this workshop-inspired by Walt Kelley's Pogo comic strip-and much stimulating discussion within it.

AB  - Crowdsourcing has become the mot du jour when it comes to resolving any types of problems, online or offline, that require sustained human involvement. We see it applied in order to motivate employees to engage with less rewarding daily routines, to attract the best possible ideas and approaches to boost innovation, or to complete data processing tasks that computing technology has yet to master quickly and accurately.In this paper we look at its various forms and flavors, from gamification to human computation and grand challenges, and discuss how it could be used to turn conventional content management applications into social machines in which tasks are performed as optimal combinations of human and computational intelligence. We introduce a framework for the analysis of the most important building blocks of such systems, as well as design and participation best practices that should guide their development.

AB  - Abstract This commentary explores the challenges and opportunities associated with a possible transition of Water Resources Research to a publication model where all articles are freely available upon publication (“Gold” open access). It provides a review of the status of open access publishing models, a summary of community input, and a path forward for AGU leadership. The decision to convert to open access is framed by a mix of finances and values. On the one hand, the challenge is to define who pays, and how, and what we can do to improve the affordability of publishing. On the other hand, the challenge is to increase the extent to which science is open and accessible. The next steps for the community include an incisive analysis of the financial feasibility of different cost models, and weighing the financial burden for open access against the desire to further advance open science.

AB  - As a national library, the British Library aims to deliver valuable services to both individual researchers and other research institutions, including those recognised by UK Research and Innovation as ‘Independent Research Organisations’. The British Library’s Scholarly Communications Toolkit is a series of ‘quick start’ guides to important elements of scholarly communications, including open access, research data management, publishing, research impact, and copyright. While addressing internal needs, they have been developed to also meet the needs of external organisations that may not have in-house support for scholarly communications. Being openly licensed and published in multiple formats, they are easily adapted to different contexts of use. This poster outlines the British Library’s approach to supporting scholarly communications both internally and externally, and introduces the series of leaflets which will be publicly available by the date of the 2020 Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing.

AB  - BACKGROUND Students pursuing advanced degrees are increasingly expected to contribute to their discipline’s scholarly discourse during their tenure in graduate school. However, they are often unsure of how or where to begin the publishing process, and do not always feel comfortable asking for help from their faculty advisors or fellow students. Scholars, including librarians, have attempted to address these concerns by developing tools and services to meet the needs of future faculty. In recent years, university presses and research libraries have recognized their shared mission in furthering scholarship, with libraries themselves offering publishing education and expertise. PROJECT OVERVIEW During the 2012-2013 academic year, subject librarians and publishing professionals at the University of Michigan Library crafted a program to address students’ questions and concerns about the publishing lifecycle. This ongoing initiative includes a multi-semester workshop series developed in concert with faculty from departments throughout campus, as well as a supplementary online toolkit that takes into account the rapidly evolving nature of scholarly communication. LESSONS LEARNED Major takeaways from this program include: the value of student assessment in shaping publishing workshops; awareness of the discrepancies of registration numbers and actual attendance, highlighting the potential for enhanced promotion techniques; the importance of university press and faculty insight; and the benefits of collaboration among librarians, publishing professionals, and faculty members. NEXT STEPS Future iterations of this program will incorporate in-depth assessment of each program, a more interactive learning environment, and better scheduling and promotion of the workshop series.

AB  - This qualitative study examines perceptions of open access from focus groups including thirty-eight faculty who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). In responses, BIPOC faculty reflect on the culture and support of open access within their departments, institutions, and professional associations. It was at a time of increased discussion about knowledge equity, the impact of access to research during the 2020 pandemic, and a precursor to the 2022 U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy Memo to expand access to data and publications sponsored by all federal funding agencies. In general, BIPOC faculty face compounded risks with open access and inequities in scholarly publishing. However, participants believe open publishing processes allow more flexibility and connection to communities. The investigators use the grounded theory method for analysis, provide themes as well as direct quotes from the data, and discuss practical applications for supporting BIPOC scholars with engagement in open access.

AB  - The difference between the advanced and developing countries in the matter of access to information for research has been continually increasing. The advent of the Internet and electronic sources of information has not only exacerbated the gap but also led to the exclusion of developing country researchers from taking part as equal partners in publishing, refereeing, and in international collaboration. If handled imaginatively, the very same technologies can help bridge the information gap between the rich and the poor countries and help improve research productivity worldwide. Many initiatives that are already in place are described and suggestions are given on steps to be taken by developing country researchers.

AB  - Library-run institutional repositories face a crossroads: adapt or die. The “build it and they will come” proposition has been decisively proven wrong. Citation advantages and preservation have not attracted faculty participants, though current-generation software and services offer faculty little else. Academic librarianship has not supported repositories or their managers. Most libraries consistently under-resource and understaff repositories, further worsening the participation gap. Software and services have been wildly out of touch with faculty needs and the realities of repository management. These problems are not insoluble, especially in light of Harvard University arts and science faculty’s recent permissions mandate, but they demand serious reconsideration of repository missions, goals, and means if we are to be ready for Harvard imitators, and especially to be ready should those imitators not surface.

AB  - SUMMARY This paper is based on a presentation given by Ken Frazier in tandem with Loretta Ebert. The term "Big Deal" is used to describe licensing agreements that provide expanded or complete access to the e-journal content of major publishers. The author discusses the liabilities and opportunities created by a library collection development strategy that avoids buying into Big Deals and focuses instead on journal cost-effectiveness. Even the most cost-effective Big Deals are not financially sustainable and can, at best, provide a transition to a more open and affordable scholarly communication system.

AB  - Watch VIDEO. From 2004, a new incentives system for scholarly publishing was introduced in Norway. Part of the funding of the HE institutions has since been based on the amount of scholarly publishing produced per institution, as recorded in the Norwegian CRIS system, Cristin. And the incentives worked. Publishing increased more rapidly in Norway than in comparable countries, over the years following 2004 (Aagard et al. 2014). But the sheer number of journal articles, anthologies and monographs is not necessarily what best brings science forward. And now the Norwegian government has announced that the publishing count will be dropped from the funding scheme (Meld. St. 14). Thus, we suggest that the right move would be to instead direct the incentives to stimulate good, transparent open science research practice. The advantages of open science, both for further research advancement and the benefit to society, are well documented (Miedema 2022). This includes early and obstacle-free access to research output in terms of articles, peer review reports and commentaries, as well as access to the research processes with preregistration and registered reports, methods and protocols, as well as FAIR research data that enables reproducible research. So, what is needed is an incentive system that stimulates such research practices. We suggest an incentive system, through the funding schemes of the institutions. This should favour institutions that follow open science practices. The institutions will thus be incentivized to stimulate open science, and identify and remove possible bottlenecks in their organisations that may hamper execution of open science. As employers of researchers as well as support staff, the managers of the institutions will look for ways to optimize local incentives, and also how their organisation may be designed, to best live up to the ideals of open science practices. Based on the above, we suggest a systematic evaluation of each HE institution, to document how well they practice such openness in their research. To accomplish this a list of criteria that can be easily monitored and objectively evaluated is needed. Several of the open research output parameters should be easy to monitor and measure through a reporting system. The evaluation should also acknowledge that necessary limitations to open processes and outputs exists, and thus avoid biases between institutions due to the nature of their research. Incentives directed towards the institutional level to stimulate open research practices will motivate the management to stimulate their organisation in the desired direction.

AB  - The author reviews past work with Ibict and the global progress made by the Open Access Movement. He postulates a theory of open access being an example of a complex adaptive system created by Internet-based scholarly publishing. Open access could be the cause of a cascade of increasing complexity and opportunities that will reshape this system. He has chosen the pervasive and global “Connectedness” created by the internet and the content spaces it provides for open access collections as a “simple disruptive agent”. He discusses how connectedness influences infinite variety, creativity, work, change, knowledge, and the information economy. Case studies from the University of New Mexico Libraries are used where appropriate. Keywords Digital libraries. Open access. Open archives. Scholarly publishing. Institutional repositories. Complex adaptive systems. Connectedness. Complexity. Social software. Acesso aberto e conexidade: estimulando inovações inesperadas com o uso de arquivos abertos institucionais Resumo O autor revisa um trabalho passado feito com o Ibict e o progresso mundial do Movimento de Acesso Aberto. Ele apresenta e defende a teoria de que o acesso aberto é um sistema adaptativo complexo criado a partir da publicação acadêmica utilizando a Internet. O acesso aberto poderia ser a causa de uma cascata de complexidade crescente que leva a oportunidades que modificarão o sistema. Ele escolheu a conexidade global que se espalha, criada pela Internet e pelos espaços de conteúdo que ela proporciona para coleções abertas, como um ‘agente simples para quebras do status quo’. Ele discute a influência da conexidade nas infinitas variedades, na criatividade, no trabalho, na mudança, no conhecimento e na economia da informação. Estudos de caso das Bibliotecas da Universidade do Novo México são apresentados. Palavras-chave Bibliotecas digitais. Acesso aberto. Publicações acadêmicas. Repositórios institucionais.

AB  - Scholarly Communication Librarianship and Open Knowledge, edited by Maria Bonn, Josh Bolick, and Will Cross, is an openly licensed textbook, packed with foundational knowledge, as well as practical lessons in open data, open access, and open education; it also includes short case studies from those working in the field. Readers hear from nearly 80 scholarly communications (scholcomm) practitioners, offering a range of perspectives on everything from coordinating an OER program to supporting reproducible research through the curation of open data. The book, intended for MLIS students and those new to scholcomm, addresses several well-known curricular gaps in the profession's training—namely, in the areas of copyright, open data, open education, and scholarly publishing. Scholarly Communication Librarianship provides both the contextual information, and the practical skills and resources necessary for a deep, multi-faceted understanding of scholcomm and all it entails.

AB  - Creating a collection of metadata records from disparate and diverse sources often results in uneven, unreliable and variable quality subject metadata. Having uniform, consistent and enriched subject metadata allows users to more easily discover material, browse the collection, and limit keyword search results by subject. We demonstrate how statistical topic models are useful for subject metadata enrichment. We describe some of the challenges of metadata enrichment on a huge scale (10 million metadata records from 700 repositories in the OAIster Digital Library) when the metadata is highly heterogeneous (metadata about images and text, and both cultural heritage material and scientific literature). We show how to improve the quality of the enriched metadata, using both manual and statistical modeling techniques. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges of the production environment, and demonstrate the value of the enriched metadata in a prototype portal.

AB  - <p class="first" id="d8704047e61">OA metadata for books is essential for the transformation of the whole scholarly landscape, and one of its greatest advantages is full, immediate accessibility. The point of origin for the OA META project was the realization that available book metadata (i.e. ONIX/MARC records) was not primarily created for the usage of indexing within an electronic research environment. Consequently, both detail and focus of elements tagged in datasets are not necessarily selected to output solidified and persistent book records. The question was how to enrich or create metadata so that it can unfold its greatest impact in an e-context. <p id="d8704047e63">ScienceOpen has created a metadata hub with a free interface to create, maintain or enrich, and export available OA book metadata that allows publishers to create comprehensive, interoperable metadata readily integrable with persistent IDs and transferable between systems to connect to the infrastructure of the scholarly publishing landscape more easily to increase visibility, discoverability, and distribution of OA metadata for books and monographs—all openly licensed and easily accessible, in compliance with common standards and best practices.

AB  - SummaryThe Open Archives Initiative (OAI) is dedicated to solving problems of digital library interoperability. Its focus has been on defining simple protocols, most recently for the exchange of metadata from archives. The OAI evolved out of a need to increase access to scholarly publications by supporting the creation of interoperable digital libraries.As a first step towards such interoperability, a metadata harvesting protocol was developed to support the streaming of metadata from one repository to another, ultimately to a provider of user services such as browsing, searching, or annotation. This article provides an overview of the mission, philosophy, and technical framework of the OAI.

AB  - In the end, 2020—the year that lasted forever—will likely be an accelerant. The lasting changes to scientific publishing and communication will be those that have been simmering for a while, but only came to a boil because of this turbulent year. One of the clearest examples of this is the likely permanence of the remote workplace for information workers, such as those in scholarly publishing. A look through the CSE Annual Meeting report archive will find a decade’s worth of articles on how to support a remote team, but many organizations remained hesitant or only allowed staff to work a few days from home. Now with everyone forced out of offices for what will likely be at least a year, many of those office spaces may not reopen, or when they do, they’ll shift focus to meeting spaces and shared desks for staff to use as needed. The full implication of this move is unknown, but one certain positive of the remote workforce is the pool of applicants for any position expands from a few dozen locals to literally thousands of potentially talented individuals. That change will be important as organizations attempt to address inequities brought to light (again) during the racial reckoning of this summer. The Coalition for Diversity and Inclusion in Scholarly Communications (C4DISC)1 was created in 2018 to specifically raise the issue of the importance of diversity in the publishing community, and this year pushed many organizations and publishers to proclaim that they will be making systematic […]

AB  - The 2022 CSE Annual Meeting will take place May 1–3 in Phoenix, AZ, and we have the honor of serving as this year’s Program Committee Co-Chairs. Along with our dedicated Committee members, we are working diligently to carry on CSE’s tradition of outstanding educational content and networking opportunities. We’re thrilled to announce that the theme for this year’s meeting is “Phoenix Rising: Adapting, Collaborating, and Learning in Scholarly Publishing.” As the first in-person CSE Annual Meeting since 2019, this year’s conference will offer attendees the opportunity to meet new industry colleagues on site. As we have all learned during the past few years, both professionally and personally we must be willing to adapt to changing circumstances, imagine new ways to collaborate, and consider each other as vital sources for new learning. Breakout sessions presented by expert speakers at this year’s annual meeting will be a mix of tried-and-true topics with universal interest to editorial offices, journals, authors, and reviewers, and will include lessons learned during the pandemic. We are looking forward to 2 keynotes this year. First, undoubtedly, you’ve noticed a lot of activity in the mergers and acquisitions space, with publishers buying services companies and long-time service providers buying platforms and technology startups. The Program Committee was curious about how all of these developments would affect publishers, especially society publishers. Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe, Professor and Coordinator for Information Literacy Services at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Roger Schonfeld, Director, Libraries, Scholarly Communication and Museums at Ithaka, have […]

AB  - This practice paper describes an ongoing research project to test the effectiveness and relevance of the FAIR Data Principles. Simultaneously, it will analyse how easy it is for data archives to adhere to the principles. The research took place from November 2016 to January 2017, and will be underpinned with feedback from the repositories.&#x0D; The FAIR Data Principles feature 15 facets corresponding to the four letters of FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. These principles have already gained traction within the research world. The European Commission has recently expanded its demand for research to produce open data. The relevant guidelines1are explicitly written in the context of the FAIR Data Principles. Given an increasing number of researchers will have exposure to the guidelines, understanding their viability and suggesting where there may be room for modification and adjustment is of vital importance.&#x0D; This practice paper is connected to a dataset(Dunning et al.,2017) containing the original overview of the sample group statistics and graphs, in an Excel spreadsheet. Over the course of two months, the web-interfaces, help-pages and metadata-records of over 40 data repositories have been examined, to score the individual data repository against the FAIR principles and facets. The traffic-light rating system enables colour-coding according to compliance and vagueness. The statistical analysis provides overall, categorised, on the principles focussing, and on the facet focussing results.&#x0D; The analysis includes the statistical and descriptive evaluation, followed by elaborations on Elements of the FAIR Data Principles, the subject specific or repository specific differences, and subsequently what repositories can do to improve their information architecture.&#x0D; &#x0D; (1) H2020 Guidelines on FAIR Data Management:http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf&#x0D;

AB  - The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Manuscript Exchange Common Approach (MECA) project is a cross-organization industry initiative to develop a common approach to manuscript transfer that can be adopted across the scholarly publishing industry. MECA establishes a vocabulary set that includes transfer, review, and manifest models. These models are designed to work with different article XML schemas, including the latest NISO Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) standard (v1.2). In order to avoid conflicts between these project vocabularies and the JATS, we reviewed the MECA vocabularies against the NISO JATS Compatibility Meta Model (v0.7). This paper describes the review and analysis of the MECA schemas against the JATS Meta Model, how we documented the analysis, and the recommendations we made to resolve issues revealed by the analysis. It includes the documentation we produced to communicate the results of the analysis and what actions we took to move forward with the project, including both changes to the schemas and requests for changes in the JATS. We hope sharing our experiences with this process will help others who are trying to do the same.

AB  - The OA Book Usage Data Trust effort (www.oabookusage.org) is exploring how an International Data Space (IDS) could address issues of trust, data quality, and resource-burdens for OA usage data reporting and analytics. Currently individual libraries, publishers, and scholarly publishing platforms and services must normalize, curate, and aggregate their usage and impact metrics as provided from numerous platforms. While well-resourced organizations may have the time and expertise to curate and aggregate open and privileged usage data across provided COUNTER-compliant and non-COUNTER compliant reports; smaller presses, publishers, and innovative projects often lack the resources necessary to process incoming usage data and benefit from robust OA impact analytics. To address this disparity and improve the quality and interoperability of OA book usage data, OA book publishing stakeholders are exploring how to adopt the international data space (IDS) models and standards. Awarded 1.2Million USD by the Mellon Foundation, a team led by OPERAS, OpenAIRE, the University of North Texas, and Johns Hopkins University are hosting community consultations to determine what data stewardship and security practices are needed to achieve trusted direct usage data exchange at scale.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to review the trend in academic libraries toward including scholarly communication, and by extension, electronic publishing, as part of their core mission, using the Cornell University Library as an example. Design/methodology/approach The paper describes several manifestations of publishing activity organized under the Library's Center for Innovative Publishing, including the arXiv ( http://arxiv.org/ ), Project Euclid ( http://projecteuclid.org ), and DPubS ( http://DPubS.org ). Findings Libraries bring many competencies to the scholarly communications process, including expertise in digital initiatives, close connections with authors and readers, and a commitment to preservation. To add publishing to their responsibilities, they need to develop expertise in content acquisition, editorial management, contract negotiation, marketing, and subscription management. Originality/value Academic libraries are making formal and informal publishing a part of their core activity. A variety of models exist. The Cornell University Library has created a framework for supporting publishing called the Center for Innovative Publishing, and through it supports a successful open access repository (arXiv), a sustainable webhosting service for journals in math and statistics (Project Euclid) and a content management tool (DPubS) to enable other institutions (libraries, scholarly societies, presses) to engage in similar ventures to increase the dissemination of scholarship and to lower the barriers to its access.

AB  - More details on the financial model can be found in Section 3.6. Mission-Driven AlliancesUnderpinning our proposal is the belief that societies, colleges, universities, libraries, presses, and other scholarly institutions and organizations share a common mission to support the creation and distribution of research and scholarship to improve the lives of people and to help solve the world's most challenging problems.John Willinksy makes a particularly convincing case for OA along these lines in his book The Access Principle. 12Few question the societal benefit of providing wider access to research that could help citizens make informed decisions about their health care or enable a small business to innovate and help fuel the economy, but an equally compelling case can be made for providing access to political or policy research that improves the effectiveness of an NGO working in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or literary criticism on the works of Alice Munro or Edwidge Danticat that inspires students at an under-resourced high school.Restricting access to research benefits no one and runs counter to the stated mission of educational and not-forprofit institutions.While our proposed model admittedly challenges the traditional focus, work processes, and financial operations of our institutions, it also enables them to more fully achieve their mission.

The past 18 months, however, have taught us the value of being flexible and creative, not only in scholarly publishing, but in life. Many associations have had to alter standard work protocols to accommodate a virtual workplace and, for some, that has meant adjusting the existing workflow. Now, with vaccinations readily available and offices reopening, it is a good time to revisit best practices for implementing an efficient and effective workflow and figuring out what will work and what to avoid. This session examined different approaches for the development of publishing guidelines, workflow, best practices, and the challenges around implementation from three perspectives: a small-to-midsize society (American Meteorological Society), a large umbrella society (American Heart Association), and a large society that has been very involved in promoting common approaches across multiple societies (American Geophysical Union). Moderator Michael A Friedman, Sr Manager for Publishing Operations at the American Meteorological Society (AMS), a small-to-midsize society located in Boston, approaches this topic considering all the constituencies they serve—academia, the public, the private […]

AB  - This study explores how ICTs and the Internet are influencing, and being influenced by, the evolution of institutions, organizations and workflows that play a role in scholarly work. Based on a literature review and a structured analysis of 8 carefully selected web sites, this study explores: (i) the evolving business models of scientific journals; (ii) the new competitive dynamics triggered by open access and article-level metrics; (iii) the traditional and emerging forms of peer review; and (iv) the emerging ICT-enabled changes in research workflows. The findings depict a highly complex and dynamic scenario, in which different scholarly communities, with their respective institutional and organizational environments, are experimenting different ICT-based arrangements and solutions, which are dramatically widening the range of possible activity systems through which scientific knowledge is created, exchanged, evaluated and leveraged.

AB  - Preregistration and registered reports are two promising open science practices for increasing transparency in the scientific process. In particular, they create transparency around one of the most consequential distinctions in research design: the data analytics decisions made before data collection and post-hoc decisions made afterwards. Preregistration involves publishing a time-stamped record of a study design before data collection or analysis. Registered reports are a publishing approach that facilitates the evaluation of research without regard for the direction or magnitude of findings. In this article, I evaluate opportunities and challenges for these open science methods, offer initial guidelines for their use, explore relevant tensions around new practices, and illustrate examples from educational psychology and social science.

AB  - The authors analyzed the holdings, circulations, and interlibrary loan (ILL) borrowing requests of the English-language monograph collection at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Data for each area were mapped to conspectus subject areas, using Library of Congress Classifications, and then compared. The resulting data and subject distributions were analyzed by overall holdings, transactions per item, percentage of collection circulated, and a ratio of ILL holdings to requests. The method of analysis used in this study could be fruitfully applied to other research collections to assist with remote storage, preservation, and collection development decisions.

Results and conclusions: I focused on highlighting the key elements of the reviewed documents and initiatives, highlighting the directions for managing and opening of research data they set and the implications they might have for Polish and European science. I also sketched the possible inconsisten­cies between the European and Polish policies related to research data and scholarly communication.Research limitations: The documents investigated for the purpose of this paper were either Polish or provided by the European Union (EU). I have not analyzed the national documents issued by the individual member states of the EU other than Poland. Hence, it is probable that some solutions on research data management and opening already taken on the level of individual member states have not been included in this paper.Practical implications: This paper may encourage a reflection on the relationship between the regulations issued at the European (EU) or at the national (in this case, Polish), and the practices and requirements of scholarly communication which often contradict those regulations.Originality/Value: This is the first analysis of the latest Polish and European documents and initiatives as related to data management and open data (open science).

AB  - Crossref is a not-for-profit membership organization for scholarly publishing working to make content easy to find, cite, link, and assess. Crossref provides services for the publishing community such as Content Registration with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and funding data, Cited-by linking, Similarity Check for editorial originality and Crossmark for updates and retractions. Crossref has continued to grow since it was founded in 2000, and now works with over 7,000 members around the world. From these members, Crossref has indexed 87 million metadata records, and makes them available through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and search services, so that the content that Crossref members publish can be discovered and linked to as widely as possible. Along with the development of these services, Crossref has been working with the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) to help organizations who use OJS deposit DOIs and ORCID iDs and participate in other services like Similarity Check. Crossref and PKP aim to continue this collaboration in 2017 to develop the OJS / Crossref plugin so that it can support more Crossref services such as reference linking, funding data, Cited-by linking and Crossmark. This will benefit Crossref members, but also the wider research community including researchers, funders, libraries and service providers who use Crossref metadata to find content. This proposal will cover an update on Crossref services, the OJS / Crossref plugin and the planned developments to the Crossref members plugin. DOI: 10.18225/SISPUBISISPUB.23

AB  - Pierre Mounier presents OPERAS, the European research infrastructure dedicated to open scholarly communication in the social sciences and humanities. With 10 core and a further 40+ member institutions from 16 different countries, its aim is to share knowledge between stakeholders across Europe. As a distributed infrastructure, OPERAS consists of a number of multinational Special Interest Groups that work on specific topics with the aim of developing services and conducting projects at a European level. Ranging from technical service providers and libraries through university presses and learned societies to entire research institutes and universities, OPERAS brings together a variety of stakeholders that work collectively to promote open dissemination of research-based knowledge about society and culture. All interest groups are convened twice a year for an "assembly of the commons"; further coordinating and strategic tasks are taken care of by an Executive Committee and a General Assembly. All member organisations are required to work for open access. Individuals that want to contribute are encouraged to check whether there are any member institutions in their country; in case not, they can always contact one of the coordinators (Pierre Mounier or Suzanne Dumouchel) or another member of the Executive Committee directly. Recording made in conjunction with the 17th Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing. First published online: December 27, 2022.

AB  - In recent years, Latin America has been one of the world's fastest growing areas for Internet connectivity. While numerous studies have examined the factors contributing to this communications explosion, this article concentrates upon one of its effects—the proliferation of freely available, scholarly, peer-reviewed electronic journals in the fields of literary, cultural and area studies. This article argues that in the field of Latin American studies, the majority of e-journals are being produced in Latin American countries, rather than in the US or the UK for example. It is Latin American academics, rather than their US and UK counterparts, who are embracing new technologies and the opportunities facilitated for effective dissemination of research. In order to understand this marked move towards electronic scholarly journals, this article outlines the state of Internet connectivity in the region, the financial and material constraints and other restrictions placed upon academic publication, and the lack of international visibility of Latin American scholarly print journals. While questions need to be addressed as to the future sustainability and preservation of these free journals, many of them managed by individual academics and funded by their universities, this article argues that electronic publishing offers Latin American academics an unprecedented opportunity to disseminate their research. Furthermore, this model gives international academics immediate, free access to important research that is emerging from the continent, which is the subject of study. Such access has the potential to revolutionize the way that international academics approach Latin American studies and to encourage a greater degree of international academic debate.

AB  - The scholarly publishing ecosystem is being forced to adapt following changes in funding, scholarly review, and distribution. Taken alone, each changemaker could markedly influence the entire chain of research consumption. Combining these change forces together has the potential for a complete upheaval in the biome. During the 2019 Charleston Library conference, a panel of stakeholders representing researchers, funders, librarians, publishers, digital security experts, and content aggregators addressed such questions as what essential components constitute scholarly literature and who should shepherd them. The 70-minute open dialogue with audience participation invited a range of opinions and viewpoints on the care, feeding, and safekeeping of peer-reviewed scholarly research. The panelists were: James King, Branch Chief &amp; Information Architect at the NIH; Sharon Mattern Büttiker, Director of Content Management at Reprints Desk; Crane Hassold, Senior Director of Threat Research at Agari; and Susie Winter, Director of Communications and Engagement, Springer Nature. The panel was moderated by Beth Bernhardt, Consortia Account Manager at Oxford University Press. Beth posed questions to the panel and each panelist replied from their vantage point. The lively discussion touched on ideas and solutions not yet discussed in an open forum. Such collaborative approaches are now more essential than ever for shaping the progress of the scientific research community. In attendance were librarians, editorial staff, business development managers, data handlers, library collection managers, content aggregators, security experts and CEOs.

AB  - A constant question I see come up for anything related to scholarly publishing—or really anything related to life in general—is: “How do I get started?” And now that I have entered the “halftime” of my life, as my husband so lovingly calls it, I see the hardest part of really any project is just figuring out how to get going. (Side note: Jonathan Schultz, our beloved Editor-in-Chief, is nodding his head knowingly as he reads this wee-bit-late column that I promised him would be early this month. We are all guilty of not knowing where to start.) Publishing used to be so much simpler. I copyedited an article and saved it on a floppy disk. I marked up paper page proofs with my purple editing pen using old school copyediting marks. I had a pica ruler and a hardcover dictionary along with paper style guides. I even used to hand code articles with XML for overtime. I will always love those overtime opportunities both for the XML knowledge and the Christmas gifts they bought my kids. Articles were published and then largely forgotten as we moved on to the next ones. Glossy journals piled up in stacks and collected dust as the same cycle repeated itself again and again. Thank you for indulging my walk down memory lane, but I am here to tell you that the way we do things today is so much better. Looking back, I think of all of those amazing articles that readers missed out […]

AB  - Librarians with faculty status are expected to do research and publish just as their teaching colleagues do. But unlike teaching faculty, most librarians have neither flexible work schedules nor nine-month contracts that are conducive to ongoing research and publication. This means that the requirement to publish in order to be a successful academic often competes with the requirement to perform daily work in order to be a successful librarian. One of the reasons the authors undertook this study was to examine whether the pressure to publish on most academic librarians has an impact on the quality of the literature appearing in library journals. Authors and editors of twenty-two library journals were surveyed to see how both sides of the publishing equation feel about the quality of their end product. This study reveals interesting findings about both editors and authors of library literature, and concludes with suggestions for improving the publishing process.

AB  - To assess the amount, relevance, content, and suppressibility of academic electronic spam invitations to attend conferences or submit manuscripts. Prospective cohort study. Email accounts of participating academics. Five intrepid academics and a great many publishers, editors, and conference organisers. Unsubscribing from sender's distribution lists. Number of spam invitations received before, immediately after, and one year after unsubscribing from senders' distribution lists. The proportion of duplicate invitations was also assessed and the relevance of each invitation graded to the recipient's research interests. A qualitative assessment of the content of spam invitations was conducted. At baseline, recipients received an average of 312 spam invitations each month. Unsubscribing reduced the frequency of the invitations by 39% after one month but by only 19% after one year. Overall, 16% of spam invitations were duplicates and 83% had little or no relevance to the recipients' research interests. Spam invitations were characterised by inventive language, flattery, and exuberance, and they were sometimes baffling and amusing. Academic spam is common, repetitive, often irrelevant, and difficult to avoid or prevent.

AB  - Not since the age of Gutenberg has an information upheaval so thoroughly disrupted the processes of scholarly knowledge creation, management and preservation as the digital revolution currently under way. Academic libraries have traditionally been structured to effectively facilitate the access, use and storage of mostly static, print-based research collections. In the midst of sweeping change university libraries are attempting to re-imagine services, embrace emerging technologies, reallocate resources and provide proactive leadership in a new digital knowledge society. This article provides both historical perspective and a forward-looking examination into how academic libraries are transforming themselves to both cope with, and help shape, unprecedented transitions in scholarly research and communication.

AB  - The scarcity of literature in educational institutions is a serious problem in different parts of the world, particularly in developing countries where there is a real need for better access to information. It is vitally important that the technological gap between developing and developed countries is narrowed, and scientific journals have a key role to play in ensuring that this takes place. This paper aims to assess and evaluate Digital Publishing (Open Access Publishing and Open Source Models) as a proposed solution to avoid restrictions on accessing scientific knowledge, particularly in the developing countries. More importantly, the paper outlines opportunities and challenges of open-access publishing for the developing countries. However, oftentimes there are mismatches between what the 'donor' countries can reasonably offer and what the developing countries can implement.

AB  - This paper summarizes the 17th Academic Publishing in Europe (APE) Conference: The Future of the Permanent Record, held online from 11 until 13 January, 2022, and organized by the Berlin Institute of Scholarly Publishing (BISP), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing publishers, researchers, funders and policymakers together. The conference consisted of keynote speeches, presentations, and panel discussions on a variety of scholarly communication topics. Main themes were the value of the Version of Record and how to preserve quality and trust in the scholarly record. Collaboration across all stakeholders and high-quality metadata are key, especially when looking at the future where a “record of versions” could exist, connecting all research outputs. Other conference topics involved the threat of paper mills, research integrity and the importance of digital preservation. To ensure trustworthy and high-quality publications, knowledge exchange and cooperation are crucial. Effective partnerships and a multi-perspective approach are key in fostering inclusion, diversity and equity in scholarly communication too. Several speakers stressed the important role publishers play in moving towards an inclusive and trusted Open Science ecosystem, in which data sharing is accelerated and quality assurance and control are implemented across the entire research cycle. To achieve this, new ways of working and new business models need to be developed, and entrepreneurship and innovation encouraged. The 17th APE ended with a session in which five startups showcased their innovative products to advance science.

AB  - Scholarly publishing in the fields of science and engineering plays an important role in developing and disseminating knowledge. In this context, bibliometric analysis is used as a method and tool to understand trends, patterns, and impact of scientific publications. The main objective of this research is to carry out bibliometric analysis of articles published by Semarak Ilmu Publishing. Information about productivity, collaboration, and impact of publications based on the keyword “Semarak Ilmu Publishing” as publisher was explored to provide better insight into their potential contribution to improving understanding and development in the fields of science and engineering. Based on the analysis, the number of articles that were published in 2019 - 2024 reached more than 40 articles with the number of articles per year being 45 articles in 2019, 75 articles in 2020, 50 articles in 2021, 79 articles in 2022, 66 articles in 2023, and 17 articles in 2024. For the case of 2024, since it is still at the beginning of the year, the number of publications is still low. Apart from that, each article has been widely cited by other authors with an average citation per year of 263.53 citations. This research becomes an initial basis for further evaluation of Semarak Ilmu Publishing and its contribution to supporting the scientific ecosystem.

AB  - This article discusses the future of quality control in an academic publication system that will be largely based on electronic publishing. Information and communication technologies both challenge traditional ways and open remedies for existent problems of present gate-keeping. New forms of ex-ante and of ex-post quality control may partly replace and partly amend peer review, citation indices and quality filters based on the reputation of the publisher. Open peer review, online commenting, rating, access counts and use tracking are evaluated and put in perspective. Refuting the common argument that e-publishing leads to less quality, this paper puts forward scenarios of the future quality control system. Most likely, we shall see mixed systems, combining old and new elements, of different shapes in the different research fields.

AB  - Academic institutions around the United States are facing pressure to reduce tuition and fees in order to keep higher education accessible. Open Education Resource (OER) is one attempt by academic institutions to provide high quality education resources at a lower cost to students, by replacing traditional textbooks with freely available or low cost materials. Libraries as information experts play an active role in the implementation of OER. This article looks at the current state of OER and what potential impacts OER will have on libraries.

AB  - Building on the 2019 ACRL/SPARC Forum on Collective Reinvestment in Open Infrastructure, this program will explore how libraries can make different commitments to fund content created by open infrastructures. Library collections increasingly promote and reflect such open content and many have chosen to contribute to funding those products. There is not one formula or roadmap to underwrite the publishing and distribution costs of these open resources. There are many variables and considerations as some open content corresponds to serials and others are books or monographs. Open access content is increasingly found in nearly all subject areas, as scholarly publishing models have evolved. Open access does not come without a price to create, maintain and preserve the outputs. Libraries are reconsidering whether they want to commit so much to purchase materials or subscription-based products, when it is unclear what the anticipated use of any materials will be over time. Planning and opportunities for new and more flexible decisions concerning adjustments to and expenditures of the materials budget are under exploration by libraries. There are many options to invest in creating more content to be released as open access. Such options include contributing financially from the Library collections or materials budget to subsidizing or covering APCs, engaging in a more “library as publisher” model hosting journals, publishing books, creating OERs, and offsetting other expenses that ultimately drive a more intensive open infrastructure. Library leaders and partners will share their ideas about trying different approaches to contribute to more open publishing initiatives and explore whether efforts in deploying current book and serial costs to offset opportunities to build a wider and more open infrastructure is on the horizon. This analysis should incorporate the costs of analytical tools necessary to the use of such content in today’s research. Questions will be solicited ahead of time to reflect audience’s interest in such a rethinking of the library collections budget. Please email Julia Gelfand at with your questions.

AB  - The DAEDALUS project is funded under the Joint Information Systems Committee, Focus on Access to Institutional Resources Programme for three years until June 2005. The project is based at the University of Glasgow and is developing online institutional repositories for the university, while at the same time encouraging debate and discussion about scholarly communications issues and is made up of two complementary strands: advocacy and service development. This paper sets out the achievements of the project to date and details some of the advocacy strategies that have been used to engage academic staff and researchers with the aims and objectives of the project. Also discussed are some of the barriers which have been faced in obtaining content for the repositories.

AB  - In August 2017, a short paper, “The 2.5% Commitment,” was distributed on several email lists.1 The paper proposed that every academic library should commit to invest 2.5% of its total budget to support the common infrastructure needed to create the open scholarly commons. Somewhat to our surprise, the paper and the ideas it contained have generated widespread discussions and interest.

AB  - The Retraction Watch Database (RWDB) is widely used to retrieve retraction data. However, its lack of affiliation normalization hinders the retrieval efficiency of retraction data for specific research-performing organizations. A query for a university name in the RWDB may yield retraction data entries for other universities with similar names, giving rise to the issue of affiliation naming proximity. This study assessed the impact of this issue on the retrieval efficiency of retraction records for 2,692 Chinese university names in English. The analysis revealed that the retrieval efficiency of retraction records for 206 Chinese university names can be influenced by 408 university names. As of 2022, the retrieval efficiency of retraction records for 96 Chinese university names was compromised by the involvement of 402 university names, resulting in an overall retraction inflation rate of 37.9% and an average rate of 45.0%. The findings highlight the importance of curating retraction data through affiliation-specific queries in the RWDB, adhering to the official English names of Chinese universities for scholarly publishing, and adopting the Research Organization Registry system for affiliation disambiguation. Given the significance of this issue concerning the English names of universities in non-English-speaking countries, the identified causes of the problem and proposed solutions can offer valuable insights for improving the retrieval of retraction records for non-Chinese universities in the RWDB.

AB  - The Web, with its explosive growth, is becoming an efficient resource for up-todate information for the scientific researcher.Informal online archives are repositories for technical reports.Proceedings are more and more commonly published on the Web.The collection of online journals is growing.Indeed, a good number of online journals are "born digital".Many researchers simply put their papers up on their own web site.The large volume of online material makes it quite desirable to be able to access cited documents immediately from the citing paper.Implementing this direct access is called "reference linking".Some reference linking services exist today.A number of commercial publishers, recognizing the significant value-added nature of reference linking, have banded together to form the CrossRef organization.The CrossRef publishers share their metadata, which enables them to interlink their journals.This metadata is not, however, available without a fee to organizations or individuals outside of CrossRef.The vast majority of online scholarly literature is accompanied by little or no metadata.Since it is desirable to link up this literature as well, the problem of automatically reference linking online scholarly literature in the absence of metadata and author intervention is a problem very much worth considering.This paper explores this problem in detail, and presents some algorithms for extracting metadata from online texts and linking full-text documents together.The extent to which reference linking of the online literature can be done automatically is therefore the main topic of this paper.

AB  - Libraries have provided services to researchers for many years. Changes in technology and new publishing models provide opportunities for libraries to be more involved in the research enterprise. Within this article, the author reviews traditional library services, briefly describes the eScience and publishing landscape as it relates to libraries, and explores possible library programs in support of research. Many of the new opportunities require new partnerships, both within the institution and externally.

AB  - To date, the Berkeley OA fund has ensured that 43 articles are free to be read immediately upon publication and 44 additional articles are now in the pipeline. The full scope of OA publishing during this period was significantly larger, at least by a factor of four. The OA fund allocation will continue to be carefully managed over the coming years. We are tracking our potential liability assuming the OA landscape grows with additional publishers and OA options. The amount predicted as necessary to maintain the fund based on the initial 18-month uptake data is US$45,000. This is less than 1% of the US$6.2 million the library invests in subscribing to closed-access digital journals. We are paying attention in particular to the attempts by the California Digital Library, which negotiates major journal publisher licenses on behalf of the UC campuses, to include terms within the licenses that enable UC authors to take advantage of publishers'hybrid OA options [16]. And it comes with far less of the myriad overhead costs associated with those closed-access subscriptions because that subscription price doesn't tell the full story of the actual cost of maintaining the subscription. Those subscriptions involve staff-intensive license negotiations. Institutions develop and maintain systems architectures in order to ensure that only authorized users have access and respond to challenges from publishers of the content when actual or potential breaches of the licenses are identified (publishers invest hugely in monitoring use of their content in order to ensure the license terms are not breached and are quite willing to contact the institutional subscriber when any untoward activity appears on their logs). They must, in certain instances, maintain the confidentiality of certain clauses in the licenses and increasingly respond to freedom of information, public records act requests related to the investments of public resources in those contracts. The need to experiment is particularly heightened during this economic crisis when investments in subscriptions are increasingly difficult to justify, particularly given the alternate forms of open access to content and decreasing ability for libraries to reliably distinguish OA and non-OA content within the journal. We believe that institutions (and the sub-institutional units that manage collection funds) should be open to exploring alternative funding models for scholarly communication. Institutions should highly value funding models that promote universal access to their research output. And during an economic crisis, these institutions should question the extensive financial and human resource investments required by the subscription model, a model that both excludes nonauthorized users and entails large-scale and complex licensing and legal obligations. The time is now for broad-scale adoption of institutional OA funds.

AB  - ABSTRACT Scholarly Communications is in a state of unprecedented change, with publishers, scholarly societies, scientists and other scholars, librarians and legislators engaged in strategies of various kinds to push change in directions that favor their individual goals. The strategies fall into broad categories: changing the publishing market, changing the academy and changing public policy. Each set of strategies is examined in terms of desired changes and opposing forces. Trends that will likely impact the scholarly publications market are identified, as are threats.

AB  - Omnia uno tempore erant agenda (All things were to be done at one time) — Julius Caesar on how to deal with the challenges of multiple and complex operations. —Thorne 2007. The universe of scholarly publishing includes more than 30,000 peer-reviewed journals in the sciences and humanities (Ware and Mabe 2015), approximately 250 of which cover the aquatic sciences. Establishing a new journal within this large universe poses considerable challenges and risks, but also provides valuable opportunities for scientific societies. The leaders of the Association for the Sciences of Limnology & Oceanography (ASLO) took a risk in 2014 by founding a new journal, Limnology & Oceanography Letters (L&O Letters). The first article was published in 2016, and, as of 2020, early signs indicate that this risk is paying off—the journal's debut impact factor was 5.2 (Fig. 1), ranking #1 in Limnology and #2 in Oceanography in 2019. Other indicators of early success include trends of increasing article downloads and citations (Fig. 2), articles receiving exceptional Altmetric Attention Scores (e.g., a score of 968 for Hotaling 2020), and many early-career researchers embracing the journal as both authors and reviewers. Many new journals fail, so how was L&O Letters conceived and what were the keys to its early success? We address these questions with two purposes, first to share personal retrospectives on the journal's early history, including its conception and launch, from ASLO Executive Director Teresa Curto, past ASLO President John Downing, and Founding Editor-in-Chief Pat Soranno. Second, we use the early L&O Letters story to highlight ingredients that appear essential for the successful launch of a new journal. Launching a new journal is a substantial effort and scientific publishing has a legacy of publications that failed because they did not fill a unique niche or void. Most new journals are Open Access and strive for rapid peer review, so they must offer something beyond these expected features and they must develop and succeed quickly to be self-sustaining. Without subscription revenue to help “seed,” fund, and sustain operating expenses, new journals must attract authors who are willing to invest in the article processing charges of open-access publication. Early success also requires authors to take a risk by submitting to a journal that has no Impact Factor for at least 3.5 yr and may never receive one. Established journals receive content at a healthy pace, but start-up journals have an uphill battle that requires significant effort to attract submissions. Like Kevin Costner's Field of Dreams, you build it and hope they (authors and readers) will come. “a platform for communication of the most innovative and trend-setting research in the aquatic sciences. Manuscripts should present high impact, cutting-edge results, discoveries or conceptual developments in any area of limnology and oceanography or its integration. Manuscripts will be selected based on their broad interest to the field; the strength of their empirical and conceptual foundations; their insightful, succinct and elegant conclusions; and their potential to advance knowledge in the aquatic sciences. Submissions must be short-format articles that are concise, highly focused analyses, with few display items.” Most scientific societies depend on publication revenue (Downing 2020), and library subscriptions to L&O were slipping in ca. 2010 when the publication environment became increasingly competitive (Downing 2013). As a step to ensure stability in finance and governance, the ASLO Board created an ad hoc committee to produce a forward-looking evaluation of ASLO's publications portfolio and operations. This committee recommended the hiring of an Executive Director (ED) to evaluate publication strategies and for ASLO to seek a commercial publishing partner to strengthen its market share of aquatic science publications. Teresa Curto accepted the ED position and began working with ASLO in February 2014. Meanwhile, following discussions with the ad hoc committee, I proposed three new journals to the Board of Directors, including L&O Letters, at the 2013 ASLO meeting. In my President's report, I wrote: “These could address empty market niches (such as) L&O Letters (LOL!) - Publishing fast-breaking, high-profile aquatic science” (These) “should be profit-making enterprises that charge competitive free-access charges to authors.” My proposal was roundly rebuffed as “competing with ourselves” in a limited market. Undaunted, I proposed these journals a second time in 2014, emphasizing the particular need for a Letters-type journal. With guidance from the new ED and committee members, the Board approved the launch of L&O Letters in August 2014. Also, in 2014, the ASLO Publications Committee (PC) interviewed several publishers to partner with to publish its portfolio, including the not-yet launched L&O Letters. Wiley, the selected partner, was enthusiastic about L&O Letters and made it part of their bid for the ASLO contract. The scope of L&O Letters was formulated by the PC and approved as described above. It is important that scientific societies avoid creating publications that compete with themselves. Prior to ratification of this scope, the PC Chair and I discussed it with the L&O Editor-in-Chief to ensure that it did not overlap with his and the Board's visions for the society's flagship journal. The PC's search for an L&O Letters Editor-in-Chief began in February 2015 and interviews took place in April. Pat Soranno was recommended enthusiastically by the PC because of her vision to create an author-centric journal that leverages the latest publishing technology and developments to create a new platform for communication among aquatic scientists. The first letters article was published in August 2016 (Saros et al. 2016). It should be noted that ASLO had previously attempted the creation of new publications: Limnology and Oceanography Fluids and Environments (2011–2014); Limnology and Oceanography eBooks (2010–2014); and Limnology and Oceanography eLectures (2009–2018). All were valiant attempts that required immense energy but were not sustainable. Some lessons from these experiences were that professional publication management (e.g., an Executive Director and a publishing partner) is a necessity for success, that new publication products need to fill large markets that are underserved by current offerings, and that authors need to be given sufficient confidence in the future of the product before entrusting their work. Upon reflection, 2014 was momentous for ASLO: we built a new governance structure, hired an Executive Director, engaged a professional publishing partner, consolidated our publications portfolio, enabled an expertise-driven PC, and founded a new publication. Julius Caesar, when fighting battles in several places and his armies were challenged on all sides, said that it is the usus (experience), the scientia (knowledge), and good foresight on the part of leadership that allows the creation of simultaneous solutions (Thorne 2007). L&O Letters' first Editor-in-Chief also faced the need to rise to simultaneous multiple challenges. When John Downing described the L&O Letters idea to me, I saw a rare opportunity to build a journal from the ground up, with a good chance of success given the strong relationship with Wiley, ASLO's publishing partner, and the need for the journal in the aquatic sciences. However, to see this vision through, we needed to build an editorial board from the ground up that would help to develop the culture and practices for the journal, who would serve as ambassadors for the journal to the many aquatic science research communities, and who would set the standards for rigor, impact, and quality that we were striving for. As the founding Editor-in-Chief, I am indebted to those scientists that agreed to join a fledgling journal to help shape and grow it. The journal could not exist without this superb group of individuals donating their time and energy to this effort, many of who are still serving, and one of which, Jim Cloern, who agreed to take the helm while I took leave and who is continuing to strengthen and build the journal. The early development of the journal was guided by two principles. The first is open science. However, not all aquatic scientists had fully embraced or had experience with open science practices such as data sharing. Therefore, an important early focus was to facilitate data sharing by providing authors resources to lower the barriers of adoption, such as detailed author guidelines for sharing data, an easy-to-use metadata template that ensures their data are well-described, and a short article describing the steps for sharing data (Soranno 2019). The second principle is related to the culture of science, particularly related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The scientific enterprise has much work ahead to create a culture that welcomes those who are marginalized or underrepresented, as well as those with less power, such as early-career researchers. These groups are typically not “at the table” making important decisions, and too often their members do not feel like they belong. Although I am not from a marginalized group, as a woman in science I have experienced the feelings of not belonging, of being an outsider or imposter, of not being listened to, and having anger directed at me for actions that, coming from a man in my position, would be applauded. I saw the position of Editor-in-Chief as an opportunity to think strategically about equity and inclusion throughout all decisions needed to build and run a journal. For example, I eliminated the “confidential comments to editors” box for reviewers as a step toward transparency in editorial decisions. I monitored reviewer comments so that inappropriate and personal attacks were not passed on to authors or considered in editorial decisions. I also sought exciting research from a wide range of scholars—early to late career, small to large research institutions, and across the globe. I hope this is an area where the journal can continue to grow and expand its impact. Finally, I developed a program to formally include early-career researchers in the publishing enterprise, the Raelyn Cole Editorial Fellowship (RCEF), which is supported from a fund established by a generous donation from the family of Raelyn Cole, Managing Editor of ASLO's flagship journal, Limnology and Oceanography, from 1965 to 1996. The RCEF was designed to give early-career researchers experiences in publishing and editing earlier rather than later in their careers and to provide them “a seat at the table” in high level discussions of the journal and publishing so that they could contribute their important perspective. In fact, the development of the RCEF was one of the more rewarding aspects of my time as Editor. Our first two cohorts of RCEF fellows have contributed to the journal and to ASLO in many important ways, including their articles about publishing that target early-career researchers and beyond (Falkenberg and Soranno 2017; Deemer et al. 2020; Hotaling 2020; Poulson-Ellestad et al. 2020), blog posts sharing their experiences, workshops on writing and publishing, contributions during joint ASLO-Wiley strategy meetings, and becoming valued collaborators and colleagues. I am particularly indebted to all our RCEF fellows because there was no model for editorial fellowships when we launched this program, and they were critical in its co-development. Laura Falkenberg deserves special mention as the first fellow who was willing to take on a new, minimally defined opportunity and not only run with it, but set an exceptionally high bar that all subsequent fellows have more than met! In thinking about how to sustain and grow a new journal after its successful launch, I think L&O Letters must not only focus on attracting and publishing the most impactful research written for scientists in all subfields in the aquatic sciences, but it must also continue to be author-centered, focused on inclusion, equity, and diversity, and always be at the cutting-edge of open science. Because we are amid major shifts in scientific publishing, and even science itself, L&O Letters will stay strong by adapting to the changing needs of all scientists. None declared. It should not be forgotten that the launch of a successful journal demands the volunteer dedication of many people. We therefore thank the many who made this possible. The 2008 strategic planning committee (Debbie Bronk, Paty Matrai, Carlos Duarte, & JAD) launched ASLO's guiding principles. The ACE Committee sought professional expertise to launch a forward-looking evaluation of ASLO's publications portfolio and overall operations (Paul del Giorgio, Debbie Bronk, Howard Browman, Lisa Campbell, JAD, and Paty Matrai). The executive director search committee (Karen Barch, JAD, Jim Elser, Wally Fulweiler, Pete Jumars, Roxane Maranger, and Helen Schneider) brought us the ED we needed to make this happen. The 2014 PC chaired by Paul del Giorgio searched for and recommended a new publishing partner. The 2015 PC (chaired by Wally Fulweiler with JAD, Mike Leonard, Miguel-Angel Mateo, Mike Pace) formulated the scope of L&O Letters, interviewed EiC candidates, and recommended Pat Soranno to the Board. The late Val H. Smith eloquently expressed his vision for a rejuvenated L&O thereby amplifying the Board's vision for L&O Letters. Joe Ackerman, Robin Anderson, and Jennifer Cherrier poured immense energy into promising publication ideas, helping the ASLO Board understand how much effort and production expertise new publications demand. Many others volunteered their time to serve on ASLO's Board at this time, playing critical roles in the evolution and vetting of ASLO's future, including: Lihini Aluwihare, Claudia Benitez-Nelson, Tom Bianchi, Amy Burgess, Jim Cotner, Alli Fong, Deidre Gibson, Paul Kemp, Peter Leavitt, Susanne Menden-Deuer, Liz Minor, Uta Passow, Gillian Stewart, Phil Taylor, Lars Tranvik, Anya Waite, Kim Wickland, Grace Wilkinson, and Michelle Wood. They should be recognized for their science leadership because this could not have happened without them. We owe a huge thanks to the founding editorial board of L&O Letters who played a major role in launching, implementing, and refining the journal vision through their editorial service and guidance to the journal Editor-in-Chief and ASLO: Mark Altabet, John Anderson, Meryem Beklioglu, Jill Baron, Claudia Benitez-Nelson, Alberto Borges, Kristen Buck, Carla Caceres, Kendra Cheruvelil, Jim Cloern, Jonathan Cole, Daniel Conley, Henrietta Dulai, Carlos Duarte, Rana El-Sabaawi, Peter Franks, Anna Gardmark, Patricia Glibert, Elise Granek, James Heffernan, Iris Hendriks, Dag Hessen, Jeffrey Krause, Peter Leavitt, Catherine Lovelock, Margaret Mulholland, Jordan Read, Jennifer Rehage, Barbara Robson, Michael Roman, Mark Scheuerell, Emily Stanley, Jennifer Tank, Lars Tranvik, Gesa Weyhenmeyer, Angelique White, and Monika Winder. Special thanks to Jim Cloern who has been Editor-in-Chief since August 2019 and who is continuing to push the journal in important directions. We also thank the Raelyn Cole Editorial Fellows Laura Falkenberg, Kelsey Poulson-Ellestad, Scott Hotaling, and Bridget Deemer who have contributed valuable ideas, perspective, and energy. We also thank Wiley as a valued and major contributing partner at all stages. We especially thank Hannah Smith in the early stages, and later Fiona Sarne who provided superb leadership, vision, and support to this emerging journal. Finally, a heartfelt thanks to those early authors who trusted us with their finest work. It has been an honor to work with you to get your work published and we are thrilled that you joined us on the journey to build the journal.

AB  - The shift towards the use of electronic media in scholarly communication appears to be an inescapable imperative.However, these shifts are uneven, both with respect to field and with respect to the form of communication.Different scientific fields have developed and use distinctly different communicative forums, both in the paper and electronic arenas, and these forums play different communicative roles within the field.One common claim is that we are in the early stages of an electronic revolution, that it is only a matter of time before other fields catch up with the early adopters, and that all fields converge on a stable set of electronic forums.A social shaping of technology (SST) perspective helps us to identify important social forces -centered around disciplinary constructions of trust and of legitimate communication -that pull against convergence.This analysis concludes that communicative plurality and communicative heterogeneity are durable features of the scholarly landscape, and that we are likely to see field differences in the use of and meaning ascribed to communications forums persist, even as overall use of electronic communications technologies both in science and in society as a whole increases.

AB  - ABSTRACT “Open data” is a popular phrase in research practice and science policy. While stakeholders agree on some aspects of this concept, many others remain hotly debated. As a means to identify the main themes and arguments surrounding open data, we analyzed highly cited publications from the last 10 years that address data sharing or open access to research data. We identify and synthesize eight components of open data that vary among policies, studies, and initiatives, and present problematic arguments worthy of further investigation.

AB  - A number of initiatives exist in European countries to support open scholarly communication in humanities and social sciences. This article looks at the work of Open Access in the European Research Area through Scholarly Communication (OPERAS), a consortium of 36 partners from all over Europe, including many university presses, that is working to build a future European infrastructure to address the challenges in open access publishing. Their initial study, OPERAS‐D, revealed a variety of models among the partners influenced by national cultures. Although the partners’ activities were found to be fragmented, they also reflect the ‘bibliodiversity’ that exists in European societies. To address the challenge of fragmentation, it is argued that, by following a cooperative model, European actors can benefit by sharing expertise, resources, and costs of development for the good of all. As a future infrastructure to support open scholarly communication across Europe, OPERAS aims to coordinate a range of publishers and service providers to offer researchers and societies a fully functional web of services to cover the entire research lifecycle.

AB  - Open access promotion methods are generally divided into the ‘gold road’ and the ‘green road.’ Asian countries most commonly focus on the gold road while others focus on the green road. According to data from the Directory of Open Access Journal and the Directory of Open Access Repositories, Indonesia has the largest number of open access journals in the world, while Japan has the third largest number of institutional repositories. In contrast, in Korea, the extensible markup language services of the original text of journal articles are more popular than other Asian countries. In this article, the current status of open access in Asian countries is investigated, and typical open access journal service platforms in Asian countries are reviewed.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine recent trends that have affected university presses (UPs). The increased reliance on digital resources and fiscal constraints within higher education has forced UPs to re-evaluate their position with the scholarly communication system. Responses include an increased focus on partnerships, new forms of publication, changing business models and better meeting customers’ needs. Design/methodology/approach – The authors have reviewed publications on UPs from the past five years and added their viewpoints on current and future trends. Findings – UPs must adapt to resource scarcity and current trends in scholarly communication to remain viable. Practical implications – Both UPs and academic libraries may gain insights on how to meet the needs of researchers and scholars within a changing environment. Originality/value – This paper summarizes and evaluates a broad spectrum of research on UPs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Articles in open access (OA) journals can be published on a rolling basis, as they become ready, or in complete, discrete issues. This study examines the prevalence of and reasons for rolling volumes vs. discrete issues among scholarly OA library and information science (LIS) journals based in the United States. METHODS A survey was distributed to journal editors, asking them about their publication model and their reasons for and satisfaction with that model. RESULTS Of the 21 responding journals, 12 publish in discrete issues, eight publish in rolling volumes, and one publishes in rolling volumes with an occasional special issue. Almost all editors, regardless of model, cited ease of workflow as a justification for their chosen publication model, suggesting that there is no single best workflow for all journals. However, while all rolling-volume editors reported being satisfied with their model, satisfaction was less universal among discrete-issue editors. DISCUSSION The unexpectedly high number of rolling-volume journals suggests that LIS journal editors are making forward-looking choices about publication models even though the topic has not been much addressed in the library literature. Further research is warranted; possibilities include expanding the study’s geographic scope, broadening the study to other disciplines, and investigating publication model trends across the entire scholarly OA universe. CONCLUSION Both because satisfaction is high among editors of rolling-volume journals and because readers and authors appreciate quick publication times, the rolling-volume model will likely become even more prevalent in coming years.

AB  - The present contribution concerns a case study of open access scholarly publishing in Greece, its history and effect in helping the local researcher community transition from a print-only mode of work to online working environments and in rendering Greek publications and scholarship more relevant to the international scholarly community.The paper elaborates on the goals of the project and the challenges that were encountered and addressed during its implementation.The project, which started in 2007 with the transition of three print journals in the humanities to an online and print format and online working environment, culminated in the development of an online platform that provides access to content and services from a single point in the web, ePublishing.ekt.gr.As part of the National Documentation Centre (EKT)'s services, we systematize and upgrade the journals' policies according to international standards, provide an online working platform and training, digitize and release in open access academic articles (more than 3,500 articles in established journals, published by small, non-profit, academic/scholarly society publishers, so far), provide DOIs, as well as concentrate on electronic books and conference proceedings -also to include purely online books in the future, starting with a born-digital monograph in a Humanities subject (onlineBook).In a nutshell, we have focused on providing publishers of scientific journals a range of comprehensive services which are constantly updated and improved in the light of the developments in scholarly communication, and which foster the internationalization, visibility, and preservation of research in these fields.

The term open science has been applied to improving the transparency of knowledge generation, but open science also has the potential to address many of the problems of inequity, inaccuracy, and misconduct that plague research, as well as to build public trust.1Besançon L Peiffer-Smadja N Segalas C et al.Open science saves lives: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.BMC Med Res Methodol. 2021; 21: 117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar The UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science2UNESCOUNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949Date: 2021Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar depicts a world where all science is available, accessible, and usable in all languages, by all who need it; where all actors are transparent about the people and processes used in generating and communicating knowledge; and where knowledge generation, access, and use in academia is not hampered by inequalities or issues of inappropriate credit. Achieving this ideal is a huge task. Here we focus primarily on open research because if research is not open, the rest of the vision set out in the UNESCO Recommendation cannot be achieved. Scientific knowledge in recent centuries has been defined by, and has emanated from, high-income countries (HICs). The world's oldest scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, was first published in England in 1665, by and for men of European origin,3Lyons HG The officers of the Society (1662–1860).Notes Rec R Soc Lond. 1940; 3: 116-140Crossref Google Scholar a tradition followed by The Lancet when it was launched in 1823. As the number of scientific journals increased after World War 2, the expectations of authorship, descriptions of methods, presentation of data, and extent of reference citation changed. These changes were driven not only by growth in science but also by the profitability of scholarly publishing for large publishing companies and scholarly societies.4Buranyi S Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?. The Guardian, June 27, 2017https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-scienceDate accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar By the last decades of the 20th century many libraries found they could not pay for the ever-increasing numbers of journals published at premium prices. Simultaneously, the citation impact factor (IF) commodified journal prestige as the route to academic funding and success.5Roberts R Bibliometrics: an obituary for the impact factor.Nature. 2017; 546: 600Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar The resulting perverse incentives to publish in journals with a high IF contributed to many of the problems of reproducibility and trust6ScienceInnovation and Technology CommitteeUK ParliamentReproducibility and research integrity.https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmsctech/101/report.htmlDate: May 10, 2023Date accessed: July 2, 2023Google Scholar that now plague academic publishing.7American Society for Cell BiologySan Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. DORA.https://sfdora.org/read/Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar The end of the 20th century and birth of the internet saw the emergence of lower cost, open access publishers and databases in not only HICs but also countries in Africa (African Journals Online, AJOL) and South America (Scientific Electronic Library Online, SciELO). Unfortunately, academic institutions worldwide embraced the IF as a key measure of academic value, rather than supporting open access regional journals for disseminating research and supporting academic scholarship in their own countries.8Abritis A McCook A Cash bonuses for peer-reviewed papers go global.Science. 2017; 357: 541Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar Success in science now typically equates with publishing as many research papers as possible, in the highest IF journals possible, which often have subscription paywalls or high article-processing charges (APCs). Researchers usually peer review the content of these journals gratis. The adoption of these perverse incentives means large investments to publish papers in high IF journals without achieving a complete description of research, or open data, methods, software, or other outputs. Such publish or perish incentives have also encouraged predatory journals, papermills, and plagiarism, falsification, and fabrication.9InterAcademy PartnershipCombatting predatory academic journals and conferences.https://www.interacademies.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/1.%20Full%20report%20-%20English%20FINAL.pdfDate: March, 2020Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar In the past decade, open science has emerged to help address some of these issues. Researchers can now use open platforms and repositories (eg, Open Science Framework and GitHub) to transparently report their work from conception through protocol development, to data collection and analysis, and ultimately to publication.1Besançon L Peiffer-Smadja N Segalas C et al.Open science saves lives: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.BMC Med Res Methodol. 2021; 21: 117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar When protocols are posted before data collection (eg, protocols.io), methodology cannot be revised post hoc to suit the results obtained.10Center for Open ScienceRegistered reports: peer review before results are known to align scientific values and practices.https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reportsDate accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar Open peer reviews increase transparency of the strengths and limitations of research and journals' decision-making processes.11Wolfram D Wang P Hembree A et al.Open peer review: promoting transparency in open science.Scientometrics. 2020; 125: 1033-1051Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar When preprints are available, all willing readers can peer review before final publication.12Sever R Eisen M Inglis J Plan U: universal access to scientific and medical research via funder preprint mandates.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000273Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar Many funders and journals now require data underlying the study to be available, and some institutions incentivise data sharing.13Moher D Bouter L Kleinert S et al.The Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers: fostering research integrity.PLoS Biol. 2020; 18e3000737Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar Researchers in some low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) settings have successfully adopted elements of open science.14Mwangi KW Mainye N Ouso DO et al.Open science in Kenya: where are we?.Front Res Metr Anal. 2021; 6669675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar However, barriers to universal adoption of open science persist. Despite calls for incentives to reward open practices,13Moher D Bouter L Kleinert S et al.The Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers: fostering research integrity.PLoS Biol. 2020; 18e3000737Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar academia and funders have been slow to change so that researchers continue to respond to the old incentives applied to their promotion, tenure, and funding decisions. Some LMICs mimic the worst HIC practices by incentivising publication in high IF journals, even paying researchers to do so.15Buguzi S Tanzania's researchers offered US$22,000 to publish in international journals.Nature. 2023; 618: 446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar No universally available infrastructure monitors adoption of open science, or uses open science to discourage misconduct or questionable research practices. Furthermore, LMICs are rarely given co-leadership in open science discussions, limiting the global applicability of resulting outputs. Given a history of appropriation of their countries' resources and exploitation of their countries' people,16Keikelame MJ Schwartz L Decolonising research methodologies: lessons from a qualitative research project, Cape Town, South Africa.Glob Health Action. 2019; 121561175Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Binagwaho A Allotey P Sangano E Ekström AM Martin K A call to action to reform academic global health partnerships.BMJ. 2021; 375n2658PubMed Google Scholar struggling with practical issues, such as unreliable electricity or internet and language and literacy barriers to publication, and challenges in obtaining funding and visas to attend international conferences and meetings,18Velin L Lartigue JW Johnson SA et al.Conference equity in global health: a systematic review of factors impacting LMIC representation at global health conferences.BMJ Glob Health. 2021; 6e003455Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar many LMIC researchers question why they should do additional work to make their hard-earned work freely available to anyone.19Boyes B Open access to scholarly knowledge in the digital era (chapter 1.1): the alienation of African knowledge—open access as a pharmakon.

We propose four steps to address the issues around incentives, deterrents, supporting infrastructure, and equitable leadership that can support the global adoption of open science. First, as described in the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA),7American Society for Cell BiologySan Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. DORA.https://sfdora.org/read/Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar system-wide change is needed to shift incentives across the research ecosystem. Researchers' promotion and tenure are determined by universities, which are themselves dependent on their institutional ranking to receive funding, with each having their own unique key performance indicators (KPI). Without addressing these KPIs, change in the research ecosystem is unlikely to occur. These incentives depend on where, not what, research is published. Researchers who serve as reviewers receive no promotion and tenure credit for their reviews. Instead, promotion and tenure and institutional ranking should depend on the degree to which the researcher and institution produce research that is open, transparent, reproducible, and useful. Peer reviewers similarly should receive academic credit for open reviews, as well as when their didactic points about problems found commonly in research are reused by other reviewers. Global groups such as the UNESCO Global Open Science Partnership can gather together key stakeholders, including institutions, funders (including governments), researchers, journals, and the public, to create the global standards for open, transparent, reproducible, and useful research. They can start with existing resources, including what is open,2UNESCOUNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949Date: 2021Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar transparency definitions, and tools such as the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship20Wilkinson M Dumontier M Aalbersberg I et al.The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship.Sci Data. 2016; 3160018Crossref PubMed Scopus (6729) Google Scholar and Transparency and Openness Promotion in Journal Practices and Policies (TOP) guidelines.21Open Science FrameworkGuidelines for Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) in journal policies and practices "The TOP Guidelines". Version 1.0.1.https://osf.io/9f6gx/wiki/GuidelinesDate accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar Tools such as CRediT authorship attribution, ORCID author identity verification, peer-review taxonomy (ie, terms and definitions used in peer-review practices),22Jones L van Rossum J Mehmani B et al.A standard taxonomy for peer review.

The National Academies Press, Washington, DC2019Google Scholar are also important for transparency. Usefulness is measured by research reuse and value to society, defined by key stakeholders at regional or local levels. Collaborative pilot studies that include funders, researchers, and journals could help test and refine the standards for open, transparent, reproducible, and useful research in the real world. Such pilot studies could help ensure that change is properly incentivised at each layer, and gather evidence as to whether the approach improves transparency and quality. The studies could be used to develop a change management plan to scale up the approach to the wider research ecosystem. Second, with open methods and data, institutions, funders, and governments might more easily uncover research misconduct. Misconduct that has different meanings in different cultures, such as plagiarism,24Ison DC An empirical analysis of differences in plagiarism among world cultures.J Higher Educ Policy Manage. 2018; 40: 291-304Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar should have a global definition. Organisations such as the Committee on Publication Ethics and the World Conferences on Research Integrity can help foster such discussions. Then, bodies related to, but independent from, existing stakeholders could investigate and coordinate a standardised and timely response for different levels of misconduct.6ScienceInnovation and Technology CommitteeUK ParliamentReproducibility and research integrity.https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmsctech/101/report.htmlDate: May 10, 2023Date accessed: July 2, 2023Google Scholar The independent bodies could help address issues such as who administers sanctions for misconduct and who protects whistleblowers.25Rhodes R Strain JJ Whistleblowing in academic medicine.J Med Ethics. 2004; 30: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar The approach to investigation should be transparent, consistent, and timely. Third, a global consensus on open science practices and tagging structures and the infrastructure tools to implement them is essential to support attribution and measurement of open science, transparency, and reuse.26Lawrence R Why interoperability matters for open research—and more than ever. Scholarly Kitchen.https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/Date: April 6, 2023Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar The infrastructure tools must be freely available to enable global implementation while sanctioning misconduct. Global tagging and open integrated infrastructure alone could help combat fraud and misappropriation. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools should be explored in all areas of reporting and monitoring open science. Effective tools could help efficiently measure publication, reuse, and attribution of methodology, data, results, and peer review, thus facilitating the new incentive structure. Finally, equity must be at the core of open science, with recommendations and pathways developed with researchers, institutions, funders, and governments to address the long-standing needs and concerns of LMICs.27Mwelwa J Boulton G Wafula JM Cheikh L Developing open science in Africa: barriers, solutions and opportunities.Data Sci J. 2020; 19: 31Crossref Google Scholar Recognising the heterogeneity across different LMICs, there is rarely a one size fits all solution. For example, APCs remain out of reach for many researchers in LMICs: waivers do not apply to many LMICs,28Druelinger D Ma L Missing a golden opportunity? An analysis of publication trends by income level in the Directory of Open Access Journals 1987–2020.Learned Publishing. 2023; 36: 348-358Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar or can be seen as unwanted charity. Thus, active co-leadership is crucial, lest the power imbalance that favours HIC researchers and institutions yields efforts that are not truly equitable. By co-leading efforts with research from LMICs in defining and performing research that is open, LMIC researchers' work can get visibility, credit, and future funding. By applying local and regional definitions of valuable research and rewarding reuse, researchers would be incentivised to undertake research beneficial to their communities. Offering credit for peer reviews and reuse of key didactic review points would incentivise peer reviewers. Language and accessibility barriers must be overcome if science equity is to be achieved;29Al-Janabi A Publish in English or perish. Chemistry World, April 28, 2022https://www.chemistryworld.com/careers/publish-in-english-or-perish/4014820.articleDate accessed: July 2, 2023Google Scholar, 30Brinn S Kasdorf B Making research accessible: the arXiv accessibility forum moved the action upstream. Scholarly Kitchen.https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/06/28/__trashed-4/Date: June 28, 2023Date accessed: July 5, 2023Google Scholar AI could help scale those challenges if implemented equitably (figure). These initiatives will require coordination, cooperation, and investment, and sharing decision-making power to develop solutions that accomplish these goals and are acceptable to all. Investment can be achieved by shifting incentives away from high IF publishing4Buranyi S Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?. The Guardian, June 27, 2017https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-scienceDate accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar to global open science and independent bodies. Willingness to incorporate LMIC concerns, priorities, and cultures in global open science is likely to be challenging, but the goal of making science more accessible, equitable, and reliable is well worth the effort. Everyone with a stake in open science—which includes, literally, everyone—must be willing to work together to develop a detailed, actionable, agreed-upon blueprint for global open science with effective incentives and safeguards. This global cooperation and collaboration between countries that may be at odds politically and financially has few precedents. However, the reward for these efforts will be scientific knowledge that is transparent, accessible, generated fairly, and fully accessible and available to improve society and save lives. We urge all those working on disparate parts of this enterprise to coordinate efforts to achieve an open research enterprise for the benefit of all.

AB  - INTRODUCTION The video abstract has emerged in recent years as a new way of communicating the results of scholarly enquiry. For library-based journal publishers who want to support multimodal scholarship, it is useful to understand the potential benefit and impact of incorporating video abstracts into their publications. This paper provides an overview of the growth of video abstracts in science scholarship, and presents a single journal case study that compares the use and potential impact of video abstracts hosted on both YouTube and on a journal’s own website. METHODS For the case study, video abstract usage data for the New Journal of Physics (NJP) was gathered from both YouTube and the NJP native platform and then correlated using a Spearman rank correlation coefficient test to analyze viewing usage. Viewership data from both platforms was also correlated with article usage counts using Spearman to study the relationship between article usage and corresponding video abstract usage. RESULTS Users predominantly accessed the journal’s hosted video abstracts instead of the abstracts posted on YouTube. However, there was a moderate positive correlation comparing view counts of the same video abstracts across both platforms, suggesting proportionate use of both platforms. In addition, the top 25 and 100 read articles had a significantly higher presence of video abstracts than articles overall in the data set, although a specific reason for that relationship cannot be identified. DISCUSSION &amp;amp; CONCLUSION Video abstracts are a natural evolution of science communication into multimodal environments. Publishing trends will likely continue to grow gradually, with appreciation for non-traditional scholarship (multimodal scholarship) and new measures for assessing impact (altmetrics) potentially encouraging greater adoption. Librarybased journal publishers should consider investing in software that offers dynamic media integration, offering the video abstract option to their authors, and leveraging YouTube to further raise the visibility of their authors’ research articles and publication. Library-based publishers should have some expectation that the video abstracts will be viewed relatively proportionally across platforms (i.e. a video abstract that receives a higher or lower view count on the journal’s website is moderately more likely to also receive a higher or lower view count on YouTube), with the majority of total views (for all videos) coming from the journal’s website. Subject and media librarians should become more aware of these emerging practices to support the video abstract publication and creation needs of their research communities.

AB  - Together with many other universities worldwide, the University of Göttingen has aimed to unlock the full potential of networked digital scientific communication by strengthening open access as early as the late 1990s. Open science policies at the institutional level consequently followed and have been with us for over a decade. However, for several reasons, their adoption often is still far from complete when it comes to the practices of researchers or research groups. To improve this situation at our university, there is dedicated support at the infrastructural level: the university library collaborates with several campus units in developing and running services, activities and projects in support of open access and open science. This article outlines our main activity areas and aligns them with the overall rationale to reach higher uptake and acceptance of open science practice at the university. The mentioned examples of our activities highlight how we seek to advance open science along the needs and perspectives of diverse audiences and by running it as a multi-stakeholder endeavor. Therefore, our activities involve library colleagues with diverse backgrounds, faculty and early career researchers, research managers, as well as project and infrastructure staff. We conclude with a summary of achievements and challenges to be faced.

AB  - In recent years, the landscape of collection management has been radically transformed by the explosion of digital content, the importance of collaborative initiatives for content acquisition and shared print management, new licensing and acquisition models, the dramatic shift in facilitating access versus ownership, and a crowded field of providers and platforms. The academic library itself has been utterly changed in the past two decades. What does this mean for the ways in which we teach the next generation of librarians about the activities, goals, and issues involved in collection management? I have taught a collection management course three times, from 2010 to 2012, at the School of Information Studies at the University of Ottawa-Canada. The Master of Information Studies program was established in 2007, and the school is very proud to have received full accreditation from ALA in 2014. A few challenges Expectations of collections work are rapidly changing. As Peggy Johnson has noted, “User expectations about the services, collections, and access that libraries should provide are profoundly affecting collection development and management.” 1 LIS students need to be aware of business practices around e-resources licensing, vendor relations, and consortial dynamics and goals. Moreover, they have to become attuned to the bewildering variety of acquisition models for ebooks and preservation strategies for both ebooks and print books (and other materials), and to understand why these issues are so visceral for libraries. It is also essential for students to understand the impact of networked resources, scholarly publishing and the ever-evolving ecosystem of players in the supply chain, and budget constraints that are becoming tighter each year. With all of this knowledge, however, they need to learn how to stay close to the pulse of their patrons’ needs and expectations. Therefore liaison work and partnership are central to success. The challenge for anyone teaching collection management to LIS students is to articulate the paradigm shift from local collections to a networked and collaborative model, 2

AB  - Welcome to Volcanica's first issue! Our community of editors and Volcanica supporters are excited to present you with our inaugural issue of peer-reviewed volcano research. This editorial accompanies the first issue of Volcanica so that we can provide you with some background to the Volcanica initiative, explain some of the evidence-based motivation for starting a new journal, and explore ways in which we can improve universal access to published research. We discuss our model of "diamond open access", which is entirely free for authors to publish and free for everyone to read. We will explain how this model is possible and state explicitly the challenges related to how this project can be sustainable and scalable. Finally, we will signpost the information you may need to publish with Volcanica as we continue to grow.

AB  - For more than 110 years, the raison d’etre of The Electrochemical Society has been the broad and effective dissemination of technical and scientific information through technical meetings and publications. Specifically, archival publications make available, to current and future generations, peer-reviewed advances in scientific and engineering fields within the scope of ECS. Many of these entities can benefit greatly from this content via online publication. Our intent is to provide the best quality and widest dissemination possible to our members and to the scientific/technological community at large. The radical changes in scholarly publishing venues made possible by the Internet, and recent advances in electronics technology, greatly expand the potential for wide availability of the content covered by ECS. Of immediate interest in this regard is the unrestricted access to scholarly work via the Internet referred to as Open Access (OA). Because professional societies serve authors, readers, and developers of scientific and technological content, we feel that ECS and other societies should lead the way in the establishment of low cost, effective, and efficient OA approaches. Toward that end, ECS has embarked on a quest to ultimately offer full OA (no charge to authors, readers, libraries, or institutional members) for our four peerreviewed journals. The first step toward this goal is the implementation of our Author Choice Open Access program, which began early this year. As the name implies, authors now have the choice of having their accepted papers published as Open Access articles. Because this intent represents a new paradigm for ECS, we must determine the appropriate business model to realize our goal. Details of the various possibilities are described in other articles in the spring 2014 issue of Interface (http://www.electrochem.org/dl/ interface/spr/spr14/if_spr14.htm) and on the ECS website (http:// www.electrochem.org/oa/).

Michael Casp, Director of Business Development and Production Services Coordinator at J&J Editorial, began the session with a definition of extensible markup language (XML) and gave basic visual examples of how it is both a human-readable and machine-readable language. This mark-up language is everywhere—even in Microsoft Word. His boiled-down definition was “XML is labels.” He went on to explain various versions of XML document type definitions (DTDs) and various ways to organize them, such as NLM, JATS, and custom DTDs for content management systems. Journal article tag suite (JATS) is the most commonly used DTD for scholarly journal content; it has become the de facto XML standard in the scholarly publishing industry. Casp also discussed how peer review systems such as Editorial Manager collect metadata from authors and editorial staff and then convert them to XML files for transmittal. Afterward, a manuscript document is tagged either before or after copyediting, mostly via automation with human review, to create a new XML file of the text, tables, and metadata; as he noted, almost every item relevant to the […]

AB  - ABSTRACT This article is the fourth in a series of six emanating from the UK JISC‐funded RoMEO Project (Rights Metadata for Open archiving). It describes an analysis of 80 scholarly journal publishers' copyright agreements with a particular view to their effect on author self‐archiving: 90% of agreements asked for copyright transfer and 69% asked for it prior to refereeing the paper; 75% asked authors to warrant that their work had not been previously published although only two explicitly stated that they viewed self‐archiving as prior publication; 28.5% of agreements provided authors with no usage rights over their own paper. Although 42.5% allowed self‐archiving in some format, there was no consensus on the conditions under which self‐archiving could take place. The article concludes that author–publisher copyright agreements should be reconsidered by a working party representing the needs of both parties.

AB  - In 2012, Harvard University said it could no longer afford the high cost of academic journal subscriptions. The aim of this paper is to discuss the pressures, opportunities and costs facing research library acquisitions budgets in Australia. It seeks to understand how libraries are coping with resource issues and what strategies they are deploying to overcome their fiscal challenges. The findings are presented of a study into the pressures, opportunities, and costs facing research library budgets in Australia. A qualitative research methodology was used to undertake the study. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with representatives involved at the highest level of library resource allocation from their respective universities. The study provides discussion on how libraries are coping with resource issues and what strategies they are deploying to overcome their fiscal challenges.

AB  - Open access combined with Web 2.0 networking tools is fast changing the traditional journal’s functions and framework and the publisher’s role. As content is more and more available online in digital repositories and on the web, an integrated, interconnected, multidisciplinary information environment is evolving and Oldenburg’s model disintegrates: the journal is no longer the main referring unit for scholarly output, as it used to be, for Scientific, Technical, and Medical disciplines, but scholars’ attention is now more focused on the article level. New journals models are thus evolving. The first part of this paper discusses these new experimental journal models, i.e. overlay journals, interjournals and different levels journals. The second part directs readers’ attention to the role commercial publishers could play in this digital seamless writing arena. The authors consider that publishers should concentrate much more on value-added services for authors, readers and libraries, such as navigational services, discovery services, archiving and evaluation services.

AB  - Flexible learning increases access to higher education, particularly for traditionally undeserved students. First-time entrants, who may lack the cultural capital to be successful, may also be more likely to participate in flexible learning than traditional students, and particularly in online and blended courses. We posit that success for all students enrolling in flexible forms of learning can be achieved through course design and responsive pedagogies. For these efforts to be successful, competency frameworks must be developed, and initial and ongoing training provided for teaching staff. This paper discusses a theory-based and practice-informed framework for the scalable expansion of flexible learning, which in our case, encompassed online learning, blended learning, competency-based education, and open educational resources. We provide a context for the framework, introduce the framework, discuss the steps for developing and implementing it, and share initial findings and implications.

AB  - This article describes a half-day preconference that focused on the library as publisher. It examined how the movement from print to online publication has impacted the roles of libraries and their ability to take on new roles as publishers. The session explored the benefits of libraries becoming publishers, and discussed Open Access, what it is and is not and its importance to libraries and scholarly communication. A detailed case study of the publishing operations of the University Library System at the University of Pittsburgh was presented as an example of a successful library publishing program. The session provided an opportunity for participants to discover ways that libraries can be involved in publishing.

AB  - With the emergence of the National Science Foundation requirement for data management plans, academic librarians have increasingly aided researchers in developing these plans and disseminating research data. To determine the overall quality of data management plans at Wayne State University, the Library System’s Research Data Services team evaluated the content of 119 plans from National Science Foundation grant proposals submitted between 2012 and 2014. The results of our content analysis indicate that, while most researchers understand the need to share data, many data management plans fail to adequately describe the data generated by the project, how data will be managed during the project, or how data will be preserved and shared after the completion of the project. Our results also show that data management plan deficiencies vary across academic units, suggesting the need for differentiated outreach services to improve the strength of data management plans in future National Science Foundation grant proposals.

AB  - Little is known about open access publishing in educational technology journals that employ a hybrid model which charges authors only if they wish to publish via gold open access. In this study we sought to address this gap in the scholarly understanding of open access publishing in hybrid journals that publish research into the intersection of education and technology. We analysed three categories of article access types: gold, green, and limited access, and collected data on their prevalence in the seven-year period from 2010-2017 across 29 journals. Data was gathered from Scopus, Unpaywall, Sherpa RoMEO, and via manual searches of the journal websites, resulting in a dataset comprising the metadata of 8,479 articles. Our findings highlight that most research remains locked behind paywalls, that open access publishing through legal means is a minority activity for the scholars involved, and that the complexity and costs of legal open access publishing in these journals may be inhibiting the accessibility of research to readers.

AB  - In the pursuit to change scholarly communication, libraries have undertaken a number of initiatives. These may include establishing a formal program, creating a committee, or taking other concerted actions at their institutions. While librarians have been engaged in targeted activities for some time, there has been no attempt to describe what constitutes a successful program. This paper proposes that five stages that are experienced in organized attempts to change scholarly communication, arguing that the use of stages provides a practical approach to addressing a nearly intractable problem. The author defines these stages, offers illustrative examples, provides measures of success, and details strategies that support the efforts toward change.

AB  - In the rapidly changing scholarly communications landscape, article processing charges (APCs) have emerged as a complex issue with many implications for libraries. This article explores the role of library consortia in relation to article processing charges (APCs) based on the results of a survey of international library consortia. The issues, challenges, and risks identified by respondents are discussed, as well as some of the potential larger implications of libraries’ and library consortia's involvement in this area.

In the face of a changing context, the structures supporting the publication of academic books have been stable. There may be potential benefits in separating the functions of the journal in a decoupled model. Separating functions could also be applied to long‐form scholarly works, with potential benefits that are worth exploring.

AB  - Abstract A study of Thomson‐Scientific ISI ranked Library and Information Science (LIS) journals ( n = 52) is reported. The study examined the stances of publishers as expressed in the Copyright Transfer Agreements (CTAs) of the journals toward self‐archiving, the practice of depositing digital copies of one's works in an Open Archives Initiative (OAI)‐compliant open access repository. Sixty‐two percent (32) do not make their CTAs available on the open Web; 38% (20) do. Of the 38% that do make CTAs available, two are open access journals. Of the 62% that do not have a publicly available CTA, 40% are silent about self‐archiving. Even among the 20 journal CTAs publicly available there is a high level of ambiguity. Closer examination augmented by publisher policy documents on copyright, self‐archiving, and instructions to authors reveals that only five, 10% of the ISI‐ranked LIS journals in the study, actually prohibit self‐archiving by publisher rule. Copyright is a moving target, but publishers appear to be acknowledging that copyright and open access can co‐exist in scholarly journal publishing. The ambivalence of LIS journal publishers provides unique opportunities to members of the community. Authors can self‐archive in open access archives. A society‐led, global scholarly communication consortium can engage in the strategic building of the LIS information commons. Aggregating OAI‐compliant archives and developing disciplinary‐specific library services for an LIS commons has the potential to increase the field's research impact and visibility. It may also ameliorate its own scholarly communication and publishing systems and serve as a model for others.

AB  - Though women outnumber men at a ratio of approximately 4:1 in the library and information science (LIS) field as a whole and 3:1 in academic librarianship, past studies suggest that maleauthored LIS print journal articles outnumber female-authored articles both in number and in citations received.The amount of citations received can serve as an indication of status within the LIS profession and can affect chances for professional advancement.This study uses citation analysis to measure patterns of gender, authorship and citation within the LIS e-journals LIBRES and Information Research, and compares these results to Håkanson's (2005) citation analysis of gender and citation patterns in three core LIS print journals.Results of this study suggest gendered affinity in citation and reference behavior.Findings include that from 1995-2007 more men than women published articles in LIBRES and Information Research; that both men and women referenced more male-authored articles; that men referenced male-authored articles at a greater rate than women referenced female-authored articles; that articles by women received more citations overall; and that men cited articles by men at a greater rate than they cited articles by women.Though female authorship was proportionately higher in the two LIS e-journals than in the three core LIS print journals, the imbalance in citation and reference patterns suggests that gender influences both male and female authors' choice of references, as well as the amount of citations that authors receive.

AB  - In this episode, a true Nestor of Open Science, Pierre Mounier talks us through the origins and growth of various French infrastructures for open research, especially in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Based at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS), he has been instrumental in transforming revues.org into OpenEdition, a national publishing infrastructure for open-access journals and books in the SSH disciplines. Mounier also discusses whether political ambitions concerning the rayonnement (‘radiance’, i.e. diffusion) of French as an international language has been a factor in acquiring governmental support for a service like OpenEdition. When negotiating with private publishing houses, the situation of the SSH disciplines contrasts to the domain of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine (STEM). In the latter domain, the formation of COSO (Comité pour la science ouverte) has proved extremely important when negotiating read-and-publish deals with major publishers. Regarding the SSH, Mounier argues for a more soft and dialogic approach, since the private companies publishing French books and journals are usually small and far less profit-oriented. The multidisciplinary CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) is a driver for open access and open research in general. For example, when physicists wanted to have a French repository mirroring the preprint server arXiv.org, this initiative grew organically into the all-encompassing HAL repository, thanks to collaboration between various disciplines facilitated by the CNRS. As for research data repositories, the set-up is slightly different. There now exists both a fallback national repository for researchers that lack an institutional or disciplinary service for their data and a federated service connecting the various institutional and disciplinary repositories across the country. One such disciplinary service is the Huma-Num, which runs a repository designated for Digital Humanities (Humanités numeriques). This podcast recording was made in conjunction with the Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing. First published online December 8, 2022.

AB  - Libraries need to move beyond traditional roles of purchasing and distributing scholarly literature, librarians need to strategically position themselves and take ownership of improving access. As a direct result of Covid-19, there is a new level of urgency to transform the scholarly communication process and there are enormous opportunities for an expanded and inclusive library publishing service which addresses access to knowledge and literature. This rich discussion will stimulate the drive to make library publishing a mainstream service within Irish libraries. The purpose of this study is to provide a vision for how academic libraries can assume a more central role in a future where open access (OA) publishing has become the predominant model for disseminating scholarly research. This work will analyse existing trends related to Open Access policies and publishing with an emphasis on the development of repositories managed by libraries to publish and disseminate articles. These trends, coupled with emerging economic realities, will create an environment where libraries’ will assume a major role in the Open Access publishing environment. This paper will provide an insight for academic libraries and their institutions to consider a dramatic shift in the deployment of subscription financial resources from a largely closed scholarly communication system to one that provides open, unrestricted access to research. Given the importance of scholarly publishing, a number of Irish Third level libraries have launched library publishing services including the establishment and management of high quality library published peer-reviewed open access journals and Open Educational Resources to support formal and informal scholarly communication. Librarians are also upskilling in the area of library publishing. A number of Irish Librarians have completed the Library Publishing Coalition's Library Publishing Curriculum. There is also the Library Publishing Group as part of the Library Association of Ireland. This work aims to identify and examine the factors of library publishing services that facilitate scholarly communication. The clear message from this discussion is that libraries need to include publishing in their services, advocate for open access and serve their communities and societies.

AB  - Editor's note: This article is the second part of a series on scholarly communications and serials prices. This paper analyzes the present serials acquisitions crisis as the latest manifestation of the instability of the economic system supporting scholarly communication, which places an increasingly intolerable burden on the research library. It reviews various solutions that have been proposed to solve this crisis, arguing that none is achievable as long as the present economic system continues. It proposes a resolution to this dilemma, drawing upon the capabilities of new electronic technology, through which the economic burden on the research library will be reduced or even eliminated, and the system of scholarly communication improved.

AB  - Abstract Research data management (RDM) is needed to assist experimental advances and data collection in the chemical sciences. Many funders require RDM because experiments are often paid for by taxpayers and the resulting data should be deposited sustainably for posterity. However, paper notebooks are still common in laboratories and research data is often stored in proprietary and/or dead‐end file formats without experimental context. Data must mature beyond a mere supplement to a research paper. Electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and laboratory information management systems (LIMS) allow researchers to manage data better and they simplify research and publication. Thus, an agreement is needed on minimum information standards for data handling to support structured approaches to data reporting. As digitalization becomes part of curricular teaching, future generations of digital native chemists will embrace RDM and ELN as an organic part of their research.

AB  - In the earlier years of the Web, libraries focused on moving services online and building digital collections, but in recent years, libraries have emerged as key players in the world of digital publishing. Librarians possess all of the necessary skills to act as digital publishers; they join the ranks of many others who have discovered the barriers around digital publishing are lower than ever. Library-based digital publishing solutions have matured to a point that the act of digital publishing could—and should—become a new core competency for the library profession. To explore this hypothesis, the researchers offer a working definition of digital publishing and assess the key roles that traditional publishers have historically offered over time. They find that librarians already possess the requisite skills to become digital publishers, and the collaborative culture of the library profession is a strength for this new role. Examples of digital publishing from two libraries at the University of California-Berkeley offer a proof of concept. Services at these libraries include the conceptualization of overall Web site strategies, a content plan that emphasizes distinctive and original material, and special projects that promote digital publishing at the local level, even as they take advantage of campus- or system-level services. Researchers find that offering library-based Web publishing services can reinforce overall information management programs and also advance the status of libraries within their respective host organizations. The comparative ease of digital publishing has opened an opportunity for librarians to follow the user as they use the Web in creative ways.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the reasons for the high costs of scholarly journals. Design/methodology/approach A brief review of the literature on journal publishing costs is carried out. The paper focuses on the economics of scholarly English language journals published mainly in the USA and Europe, but which are sold worldwide, largely to academic and research libraries. Findings Journal literature has long played a prominent role in the scholarly communication chain. In recent decades, however, the scholarly communication system has been facing a crisis due to the ever‐escalating costs of journals. Two of the features of the journal publishing industry cited a decade ago and still valid today are a lack of competition and perverse incentives. “First‐copy cost” is reported to be the main reason for high journal prices both in print and electronic publishing. Originality/value The paper provides a useful overview to researchers and document supply librarians, enabling them to achieve quickly a clear picture of journal publishing industry costs.

AB  - Abstract Abstract The rise of the World Wide Web represents one of the most significant transitions in communications since the printing press or even since the origins of writing. To Open Access and Open Data advocates, the web offers great opportunity for expanding the accessibility, scale, diversity and quality of archaeological communications. Nevertheless, Open Access and Open Data face steep adoption barriers. Critics wrongly see Open Access as a threat to peer review. Others see data transparency as naively technocratic and lacking in an appreciation of archaeology's social and professional incentive structure. However, as argued in this paper, the Open Access and Open Data movements do not gloss over sustainability, quality and professional incentive concerns. Rather, these reform movements offer much needed and trenchant critiques of the academy's many dysfunctions. These dysfunctions, ranging from the expectations of tenure and review committees to the structure of the academic publishing industry, go largely unknown and unremarked by most archaeologists. At a time of cutting fiscal austerity, Open Access and Open Data offer desperately needed ways to expand research opportunities, reduce costs and expand the equity and effectiveness of archaeological communication. Keywords: Open AccessOpen Datascholarly communicationsdata sharingdata preservationinformation architecturesethicscareer paths Acknowledgements My experiences working on various Open Access and Open Data initiatives informed this discussion. These efforts focus on Open Context (http://opencontext.org), a data publication venue managed by the nonprofit Alexandria Archive Institute (http://alexandriaarchive.org) and archived by the University of California, California Digital Library (CDL). Over the years, Open Context has benefited from funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, Institute for Museum and Library Services, the Joukowsky Family Foundation and, most recently, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. I gratefully acknowledge current financial support for Open Context data publication projects from the American Council for Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities (Award: HK-50037-12) and the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org). While I want to thank my colleagues at CDL for their support and insights in digital libraries, data preservation and scholarly communications, the views and perspectives presented in this paper are my own.

Notes For NSF, see http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/bcs/arch/senior.jsp; for NEH, see: http://www.neh.gov/files/grants/data_management_plans_2012.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free http://www.earlham.edu/∼peters/fos/overview.htm Smith et al. (2011 Schiff, L. 2012. Data publishing–the first 500 years. Data Pub, Available at: http://datapub.cdlib.org/?p=67 (accessed 5 April 2012) [Google Scholar]) note that, even if libraries keep their own local copies of content, licensing restrictions, metadata ownership questions and lack of supporting software make preservation and access of such content difficult and expensive. Bartman authored a follow-up editorial as a ‘clarification’ of the AIA's position; see http://www.archaeological.org/news/aianews/10349. This later editorial has a less confrontational tone, though it still communicates a belief that open access is not financially feasible for AIA publications. Like all forms of scholarly communication, Open Access is not immune to abuse. Some archaeologists receive email ‘spam’ soliciting articles for Open Access publication paid for by hefty processing fees. Other, ‘closed access’ presses make similar solicitations as do organizers of some high-commercialized conferences. As in all publication decisions, archaeologists should be judicious in selecting an Open Access venue. http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/ http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/reports/2012/value-and-benefits-of-text-mining.aspx A search for ‘ethics copyright archaeology’ in Google Scholar quickly returns snippets of articles about archaeological ethics, but those snippets are publisher copyright assertions. See signatories to the Association of American Publishers letter opposing FRPAA: http://www.publishers.org/_attachments/docs/library/aap%20-%20dc%20principles%20letter%20frpaa%20senate.pdf See: http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2009/10/alphabetical-list-of-open-access.html See Thomson Reuters rankings for archaeology: http://www.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/11/jun12-11_1D/ See Bethany Nowinskie's definition of ‘alternative academics’: http://nowviskie.org/2010/alt-ac/ See: http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/ See: http://opendefinition.org/okd/ See: http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/advice/termsOfUseAndAccess See: http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/ See: http://pleiades.stoa.org/ See: http://ark.lparchaeology.com/ http://opencontext.org/about/intellectual-property See: http://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/ See also the AIA and AAA responses to a recent White House ‘Request for Information’ for public access to scholarly publications: the letters from AIA and AAA on the White House RFI (Public Comments submitted to RFI for Public Access to Scholarly Publications): http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/library/publicaccess See: http://scoap3.org/ The SAA depends less on publication revenues and has lower publication costs, perhaps because it emphasizes serial publications unlike the monograph-heavy AIA. In that sense, the SAA is less heavily tied to the current toll-access status quo. The weblog ‘Doug's Archaeology’ has aggregated financial data for US nonprofit scholarly societies, detailing publication finances; see links http://dougsarchaeology.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/society-for-american-archaeology-990-form/, and http://dougsarchaeology.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/would-you-pay-4-84-per-page-to-read-a-journal/. Experiments with Open Access monographs have yielded mixed results in terms of financial sustainability, despite demonstrated positive impacts in terms of wider dissemination and longer-lasting scholarly attention; see Hadro (2010 Hadro, J. 2010. At SPARC-ACRL Forum: reality check on open access monographs. Library Journal, 21 January Available at: http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6715759.html [Google Scholar]). University presses in general face sustainability challenges with monograph publication, even without adopting Open Access models. Elizabeth Bartman's clarification of her editorial attacking Open Access (http://www.archaeological.org/news/aianews/10349) makes a similar point in that publication expenses rarely see direct support from granting agencies. However, most academic archaeologists do see less direct public support, either though employment at public universities or employment at nonprofit institutions that benefit from public subsidies and tax exemptions.

AB  - ABSTRACT The landscape of scholarly communication is complicated by multiple versions of the same documents, available from different sources. What happens if changes need to be made to published documents when scholars tap so many sources? How can important changes be communicated to readers so that they do not rely on outdated or, worse, repudiated research? This article explores the issues and describes the CrossMark service as a possible solution.

AB  - The digitization of journal content and its availability online has revolutionized journal publishing in recent years, resulting in both opportunities and challenges for traditional journal publishers. The explosion of data and the emergence of new players such as Google, new business models like Open Access, and new content consumers and producers, for example, China are significantly changing the face of journal publishing. It is not yet clear what the impact of these changes will be but by continuing to collaborate with our existing stakeholders and building partnerships with these newcomers, as well as by maintaining and promoting the quality of our content, we can ensure our future growth and success.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the reasons for the high costs of scholarly journals. Design/methodology/approach A brief review of the literature on journal publishing costs is carried out. The paper focuses on the economics of scholarly English language journals published mainly in the USA and Europe, but which are sold worldwide, largely to academic and research libraries. Findings Journal literature has long played a prominent role in the scholarly communication chain. In recent decades, however, the scholarly communication system has been facing a crisis due to the ever‐escalating costs of journals. Two of the features of the journal publishing industry cited a decade ago and still valid today are a lack of competition and perverse incentives. “First‐copy cost” is reported to be the main reason for high journal prices both in print and electronic publishing. Originality/value The paper provides a useful overview to researchers and document supply librarians, enabling them to achieve quickly a clear picture of journal publishing industry costs.

AB  - As technology has advanced, scholarly communication has evolved, creating new opportunities for academic libraries to serve researchers. This article examines the current state and potential future of academic library-based publishing. The review of the literature explores the scholarly communication ecosystem as it pertains to new publishing paradigms supported by academic libraries, including the complexity of nontraditional publishing models. These models and their implications, as well as how they may be implemented, are then explored in the academic library environment. Next, survey data from nineteen academic librarians collected at the American Library Association Midwinter Meeting in January 2015 is presented. Based on the literature and the survey data, this article argues that the principle concerns for academic library-based publishing going forward include 1) the need for the dedicated and/or sustained financial models for library-based publishing initiatives and 2) the cultural and financial capital to support librarians as they further expand their knowledge and expertise to support additional publishing-related functionalities in support of these new models. Both of these concerns ultimately tie to the persistent question of perceived quality, and by extension, reputation, of library-based publishing and open access publishing more broadly.

Results from this study demonstrate both the importance and the feasibility of the use of multiple citation data sources in citation analysis studies of scholarly communication, and provide evidence for a developing “two tier” scholarly communication system.

AB  - As the costs of scholarly and educational publications skyrocket, open educational resources (OER) are becoming an important way to provide content and enhance the teaching and learning experience. Librarians have a key role to play in developing, advocating, and managing OER. For many librarians, however, championing OERs means adding an additional responsibility to their already heavy workloads, which may be overwhelming. This article describes how a grassroots group of academic librarians in British Columbia, Canada joined together as a community of practice to learn and to share ideas, strategies, and tools to support the use of OER. The BCOER Librarians focus on the education and professional development of librarians to help facilitate the use and development of OERs and to create authoritative and sustainable resources to support librarians in OER-related interactions with faculty.

AB  - This paper explores relationships between knowledge production and academic publication and shows that the current political economy of mainstream academic publishing has resulted from a complex interplay between large academic publishers, academics, and hacker-activists. The process of publishing is a form of 'social production' that takes place across the economy, politics and culture, all of which are in turn accommodating both old and new technology in our postdigital age. Technologies such as software cannot be separated from human labour, academic centres cannot be looked at in isolation from their margins, and the necessity of transdisciplinary approaches does not imply the disappearance of traditional disciplines. In the postdigital age, the concept of the margins has not disappeared, but it has become somewhat marginal in its own right. We need to develop a new language of describing what we mean by 'marginal voices' in the social relations between knowledge production and academic publication. Universities require new strategies for cohabitation of, and collaboration between, various socio-technological actors, and new postdigital politics and practice of knowledge production and academic publishing.

AB  - Print books and ebook devices now co-exist in a reading eco-system. The ways in which readers understand and describe their experience of reading on ebook devices is shaped by long-established cultural expectations about the abstract as well as the physical affordances of the print book. Ebook devices cannot help but challenge those expectations. A review of readers' reactions to the emergence of ebook devices offers a glimpse into the complex cultural position of both the idea and the experience of reading.

AB  - The library technical services units at the Ohio State University Libraries are heavily involved in the operation of the institutional repository. A literature review revealed that the majority of articles addressing the impact of institutional repositories on library operations emphasize the role of public services. In an effort to determine if the Ohio State experience was unusual, a survey was sent to 123 Association of Research Libraries libraries through the Association of Research Libraries directors' listserv. The survey was designed to determine how the management and workload associated with institutional repositories is distributed across the library including whether institutional repository responsibilities are fulfilled in technical services and whether there has been reorganization of technical services to handle the institutional repository. Twenty-one percent of the libraries returned the survey. Most of the institutions indicated that the operation and management of the institutional repository is distributed across multiple units of the library. Most also reported heavy technical services involvement. The fact that 86% of the technical services positions involved in the institutional repository are not new indicates that, in general, technical services units have not been reorganized. Overall, there are many similarities between Ohio State and the institutions responding to our survey. The services for the institutional repository are widely distributed across multiple units of libraries and the institutions in this study reported heavy technical services involvement. However, the involvement of technical services at Ohio State is among the strongest.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to document Hong Kong University of Science and Technology's (HKUST's) experiences in developing its Institutional Repository and to highlight its programming developments in full‐text linking and indexing, and cross institutional searching. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes how HKUST Library planned and set up its institutional repository, how it acquired and processed the scholarly output, and what procedures and guidelines were established. It also discusses some new developments in systems, including the implementation of OpenURL linking from the pre‐published version in the repository to the published sources; the partnership with Scirus to enable full‐text searching; and the development of a cross‐searching platform for institutional repositories in Hong Kong. Findings The paper reveals what and why some policy issues should be adopted, including paper versioning, authority control, and withdrawal of items. It notes what proactive approaches should be adopted to harvest research output. It also shows how programming work can be done to provide usage data, facilitate searching and publicize the repository so that scholarly output can be more accessible to the research community. Practical implications The paper provides a very useful case study for other academic libraries who want to develop their own institutional repositories. Originality/value HKUST is an early implementer of institutional repositories in Asia and its unique experience in policy issues, harvesting contents, standardization, software customization, and measures adopted in enhancing global access will be useful to similar institutions.

AB  - This article will describe how permissionless metadata blockchains could be created to overcome two significant limitations in current cataloging practices: centralization and a lack of traceability. The process would start by creating public and private keys, which could be managed using digital wallet software. After creating a genesis block, nodes would submit either a new record or modifications to a single record for validation. Validation would rely on a Federated Byzantine Agreement consensus algorithm because it offers the most flexibility for institutions to select authoritative peers. Only the top tier nodes would be required to store a copy of the entire blockchain thereby allowing other institutions to decide whether they prefer to use the abridged version or the full version.

AB  - A library’s Web site can provide a powerful forum for communicating with users about changes occurring in local collecting practices and their relationship to larger issues of scholarly communication. This survey of SPARC member Web sites examines how information on collection changes and scholarly communication issues is presented. Although a few institutions use their Web sites to inform users and connect the local and the global, most present little or no informationon these topics. When collections information is present, it usually appears on either dedicated collections pages or faculty services pages. Typically, collections pages focus on largely static information describing services and policies. Information on changes in collection building is uncommon. Scholarly communication information is even scarcer and is rarely linked to information on local collection development or management.

AB  - Academic publishing is in an unstable period of transition. There is a growing degree of anger, especially from early-career academics in a time of austerity, at perceived publisher extortion. The current models of open access do not address all these problems, especially with regard to library budgets. While some of this anger is misplaced, publishers must either self-discipline their practices or find themselves displaced by alternate models. Libraries, likewise, face a dangerous time in which the threat of third-party tender for their services brings extinction ever closer. This article begins to outline a system dubbed the 'Research Output Team' (ROT) that moves publishing in-house to institutional libraries, thereby safeguarding publishing jobs and expertise while defeating the problematic aspects of the existing set-up.

AB  - ABSTRACT Library‐led publishing is one of the new approaches to journal publishing and open access that has grown tremendously in the last few years. A 2010 IMLS‐funded survey found that 55% of respondents – from US academic libraries of all different types and sizes – were already implementing or developing a publishing program. Library‐led publishing has garnered such momentum because, by offering low‐ or no‐cost publishing to university scholars, it addresses needs that traditional publishing has not been able to meet. This article presents a series of small case studies to illustrate different journals that have benefited from the library‐publishing model: (i) a journal that struggled to find an affordable publisher in its emerging field; (ii) a small society journal that could no longer afford to support itself in print; (iii) society publications that go beyond the traditional journal format; and (iv) a student journal with a revolving editorial board.

AB  - While librarians, researchers, and the general public have embraced the concept of Open Access (OA), librarians still have a difficult time managing OA resources. To find out why, Bulock and Hosburgh surveyed librarians about their experiences managing OA resources and the strengths and weaknesses of management systems. At this session, they shared survey results, reflected on OA workflows at their own libraries, and updated audience members on relevant standards and initiatives. Survey respondents reported challenges related to hybrid OA, inaccurate metadata, and inconsistent communication along the serials supply chain. Recommended solutions included the creation of consistent, centralized article-level metadata and the development of OA collection development principles for libraries.

AB  - ABSTRACT In spring 1997, a questionnaire was mailed to 95 major academic libraries in the United States to explore how serials librarians are responding to the boom of electronic journals (e‐journals). Fifty librarians (52.6%) answered the survey with one follow‐up. The study found that over 70% of the libraries that returned the survey had participated in e‐journal‐related activities. Questions relating to ‘access’ were consistently ranked high in explaining why librarians in major academic libraries think e‐journals are valuable, yet ‘cost’ seems to be a critical factor in determining e‐journal adoption. For most of the libraries surveyed, the figure for e‐journals appears modest, although some institutions claimed to have more than 1,100 titles in their e‐journal collections.

AB  - In order to create a transparent and sound academic communication ecosystem centered on researchers, we developed a system that applied blockchain technology to an open peer review system. In this study, an open peer review system was developed based on Hyperledger Fabric, which is a private blockchain. The system can be operated in connection with the reviewer recommendation module of the existing submission management system. In the reviewer recommendation module, reviewers are recommended by excluding co-authors and colleagues after an expertise test. The blockchain system performs an open peer review process based on smart contracts, while the submission management system selects reviewers for peer review. A service broker intervenes between these two systems for data interchange. The system developed herein is expected to be used as a researcher-centered scholarly communication model in the open science era, in which the intervention of publishers is minimized, and authors and reviewers (as researchers) are centered.

AB  - AbstractWith the growing number of scholarly journals in electronic format, long-term preservation of scholarly electronic journals has become one of the most important issues in digital libraries. Accessibility of scholarly journals on the Internet and electronic publishing in general is causing a shift in the responsibility for archiving journals from libraries to agreements between libraries and publishers. The author focuses on some of the important issues surrounding preservation of digital resources, especially scholarly electronic journals and presents a study on the archiving policies of the following publishers: Elsevier, Springer, Taylor & Francis, Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, and IEEE. AcknowledgementThe author gratefully acknowledges Professor Connie Foster, Editor, Serials Review, Head, Department of Library Technical Services, Western Kentucky University Libraries, for help in editing this paper and Ms. Karen Hunter, Elsevier Senior Vice President, for providing information about the Generic Standard Agreement.

AB  - OAK was founded in 2011 by a former academic publishing executive and a business software developer who encountered first-hand the challenges facing universities and authors with the growth of open access publishing – both Green and Gold. They set about creating a system that dramatically reduced administration and overcame inefficient workflows for all involved.With the establishment of the 'author pays' scholarly publishing model and the increasing trend for open access mandates from research funders, have infrastructure and resources developed sufficiently to support the additional financial and time pressures that participants now face?Individual researchers, their universities and research funders, and the publishers themselves, all have a part to play in processing and managing individual fees. It appears there is a need from all participants in the industry to make provision to encompass the administration of the publication charges required by many open access publishers. Open Access Key (OAK) is a new global company with an innovative and cost-effective solution which could provide value to all parties involved in these transactions.And in addition to financial management, OAK has been built to deliver a wide range of administrative functionality to the users. For example, OAK can feed repositories with the metadata information collected from each article processed through the platform. Automated workflow again reduces the tasks of the authors and administrators allowing resources to be directed towards research.OAK has been built by Norwegian and Danish technology partners using software that delivers tremendous flexibility. At the same time, the company has created an environment that will enable the sharing of best practice models with its customers. The company's size also speeds up decision-making and reactivity. Within an OAK account, for example, there are 'feedback buttons' to enable users to pass on thoughts, requests and general comments directly to the development team. Prior to rolling out the OAK platform to a new customer, the team spends time discussing the needs within each organisation and engineering the system to meet individual specifications.

AB  - As libraries continue to increase the amount of content purchased in electronic format, the convention of signing a license agreement for each electronic product has become overly burdensome for both libraries and publishers. The delays inherent in this process have also created barriers to access for patrons. The NISO Shared E-Resource Understanding (SERU) working group was formed in 2006 to develop a best practices alternative that will allow libraries and publishers to avoid licenses for some types of electronic resources by agreeing to the “Statements of Common Understandings for Subscribing to Electronic Resources” outlined on the NISO web site (http://www.niso.org/committees/SERU). This report summarizes the history of the project and outlines next steps for libraries and publishers.

AB  - OPERAS is a European consortium-based research infrastructure for the social sciences and humanities (SSH). It has been established as an non-commercial initiative aimed at transforming the European research area of scholarly communication and therefore it is targeted at researchers, librarians, publishers and infrastructure providers in over a dozen of European countries. This rich and diverse group of stakeholders is the key to OPERAS’s success. The proposed poster will discuss this leading idea on the example of the OPERAS-PL – the Polish national node of the infrastructure. Maintenance of infrastructures, or simply speaking: digital tools and services facilitating scholarly communication, is certainly one of the biggest challenges from the economic point of view (Edmond, 2020). However, the other challenging aspect is actually making truly useful, used and vivid tools, adjusting to stakeholders’ needs and fulfilling them (Anderson, 2013; van Zundert, 2012). One of OPERAS’s strategic plans for this to happen is the network of national nodes established in each of the partner countries (Consortium OPERAS, 2022). The nodes’ primary goal is to disseminate OPERAS services, attract users and involve new partners. However, their mission should be perceived wider. As national points of contact they actually may become the levers of the whole infrastructure’s development and perseverance – similarly to DARIAH-EU (the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) whose sustainability relies precisely on its scattered and bottom-up structure (Edmond, 2020). Our poster presents the development strategy for the Polish National Node OPERAS-PL, along with its mission, primary goals and milestones, targeted audiences, funding scheme, management methods and tools and risk mitigation. The strategy is analysed as a scalable model for similar initiatives which strive to enhance open scholarly practices in their respective communities. The poster builds on the recently launched project funded by the Polish Ministry of Education and Science and introduces two pilot research pursuits aiming at recognising the needs of the Polish SSH communities. The first pilot will study academic publishers’ needs in the field of open access. Through a design thinking technique we will recognise their needs and create a sustainability model for open access book publishing that will accomodate the specificity of Polish stakeholders. The second one will examine the potential of digital monographs as equivalent to traditional monographs in the Polish academic evaluation system. We will use our infrastructure for digital editions and adapt it to address the needs of book authors and publishers. The results of the pilots will be disseminated in the coming years at the Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing and other events.

AB  - BACKGROUND The University of Arizona Press moved under the University of Arizona Library both physically and administratively a few years ago, echoing a trend amongst university presses: 20 AAUP members now are under the administration of university libraries. To understand the new evolving relationships in scholarly communication, a review of university press and library collaborations was undertaken by the University of Arizona Press and the University of Arizona Library through the Association of Research Libraries Career Enhancement Program (ARL CEP). LITERATURE REVIEW There has been much written throughout the years on both the acrimonious and collaborative relationships between university presses and academic libraries. Much of the literature includes either editorials or case studies, with one or two major reviews of scholarly communications and the state of publishing. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT During the course of nine weeks, the ARL CEP Fellow reviewed existing literature, interviewed staff at the University of Arizona Press and Library, and conducted 27 informal interviews with library deans, press directors, and scholarly communications leaders. The interviews addressed the partnership history, structure, motivations, goals and needs, administrative support and budget decisions, key stakeholders, and thoughts on the future of their relationships as well as scholarly communications. Then University of Arizona Library and Press staff were interviewed regarding their perceptions of their roles and each other’s roles. NEXT STEPS This research report includes findings from the literature review and interviews as well as specific recommendations for the University of Arizona that will be implemented to improve and build relationships going forward.

AB  - Abstract The web contains a huge number of digital pictures. For scholars publishing such images it is important to know how well used their images are, but no method seems to have been developed for monitoring the value of academic images. In particular, can the impact of scientific or artistic images be assessed through identifying images copied or reused on the Internet? This article explores a case study of 260 NASA images to investigate whether the TinEye search engine could theoretically help to provide this information. The results show that the selected pictures had a median of 11 online copies each. However, a classification of 210 of these copies reveals that only 1.4% were explicitly used in academic publications, reflecting research impact, and the majority of the NASA pictures were used for informal scholarly (or educational) communication (37%). Additional analyses of world famous paintings and scientific images about pathology and molecular structures suggest that image contents are important for the type and extent of image use. Although it is reasonable to use statistics derived from TinEye for assessing image reuse value, the extent of its image indexing is not known.

AB  - Results of a survey of the level of access provided to selected, free scholarly electronic journals by academic libraries is reported. A list of scholarly journals that are available electronically without any access limitations was compiled, and for each title the number of holding institutions on OCLC and its coverage by major abstracting and indexing services were determined. The twenty-five most popular titles, determined by number of holding institutions on OCLC, were searched on a random sample of library Web sites and catalogs to provide a separate gauge for access levels provided by institutions. Despite approximately half the titles being indexed by major vendors, including 88 percent of the top twenty-five, access levels were fairly low and decreased dramatically with size of the institution. The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society and Journal of Extension provide examples of free e-journals with print counterparts. Approximately one-half and one-third of the institutions, respectively, provide access to only the print versions of these journals (in the latter case, the print version is no longer produced, so access to current issues is not provided).

AB  - Earlier this year, the British government approached Wikipedia’s founder, Jimmy Wales, to assist in making “taxpayer-funded academic research more widely available online.” The logic behind this decision was two-fold: like Wikipedia, open access (OA) publishing can translate into distributing research in a more timely fashion than traditional modes. Just as importantly, the Wikipedia approach attempts to disrupt the traditional model. That is, research is paid for, or subsidised by, public money but the public often does not have access to it unless they pay either a subscription or a “pay-per-view” fee. In essence, the public pays twice for the same goods. An OA approach could equate to getting what we, the public, paid for the first time.

AB  - In an effort to understand trends in open and distance education more comprehensively, this study aims to identify the research trends, major concepts, and cutoff points in the articles published between 2009 and 2016. From five major peer-reviewed journals, a total of 989 articles were analyzed through a systematic literature review process using content analysis. The articles were coded based on the following three categories: level, topics, and sub-topics. The results indicated the followings: (1) emerged main themes in the articles were foundations of open and distance education, instructional process, and effects of applications; (2) there was an upward growth in the publishing of the articles on massive open online courses, open educational resources, and students’ perspectives; (3) new pedagogical approaches and online learning design played a triggering role in the research topics; and (4) technological and pedagogical developments between 2011 and 2012 had an influence on the tendency of the articles. In addition, we explored cutoff points so that they may provide insights and valuable hints for researchers to design new studies in open and distance education field. Discussions about the gaps in the state-of-the-art trends and directions about future research were also included.

AB  - OAK was founded in 2011 by a former academic publishing executive and a business software developer who encountered first-hand the challenges facing universities and authors with the growth of open access publishing – both Green and Gold. They set about creating a system that dramatically reduced administration and overcame inefficient workflows for all involved.With the establishment of the 'author pays' scholarly publishing model and the increasing trend for open access mandates from research funders, have infrastructure and resources developed sufficiently to support the additional financial and time pressures that participants now face?Individual researchers, their universities and research funders, and the publishers themselves, all have a part to play in processing and managing individual fees. It appears there is a need from all participants in the industry to make provision to encompass the administration of the publication charges required by many open access publishers. Open Access Key (OAK) is a new global company with an innovative and cost-effective solution which could provide value to all parties involved in these transactions.And in addition to financial management, OAK has been built to deliver a wide range of administrative functionality to the users. For example, OAK can feed repositories with the metadata information collected from each article processed through the platform. Automated workflow again reduces the tasks of the authors and administrators allowing resources to be directed towards research.OAK has been built by Norwegian and Danish technology partners using software that delivers tremendous flexibility. At the same time, the company has created an environment that will enable the sharing of best practice models with its customers. The company's size also speeds up decision-making and reactivity. Within an OAK account, for example, there are 'feedback buttons' to enable users to pass on thoughts, requests and general comments directly to the development team. Prior to rolling out the OAK platform to a new customer, the team spends time discussing the needs within each organisation and engineering the system to meet individual specifications.

AB  - In recent years there has been growing international interest in the development of shared facilities to house legacy print collections as a means of providing cost-effective and secure storage. These ‘repositories’ have in some cases been successfully implemented on a national scale. This article traces the recent history of Australian attempts to reach a similar national solution to the space problems that afflict many of our research libraries. It argues that, although these negotiations have not been successful to date, the opportunity still exists to re-open discussion. It also makes suggestions regarding the organisational structures that are needed to bring about a successful outcome.

AB  - Information standards are the focus of this issue of the Bulletin. ASIS&T has a standing Standards Committee that tracks standards, formulates the Society's positions with regard to those of interest and promotes the development of new standards that seem desirable. In addition the committee has a duty to keep the membership informed about developments in this arena. While standards sessions are a regular feature of the ASIS&T Annual Meetings, the Bulletin also carries standards-related articles with some regularity. Occasionally special sections focus in some depth on particular developments, for example, the Dublin Core or those standards developments related to the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR). This section, put together for the Standards Committee by Mark Needleman, who chaired the committee for a number of years, didn't start with a specific focus, but drew on the interests of the authors. The result is two articles on metadata registries and related topics; one on the revisions currently underway to the ISO standard for thesauri; one on the state of standards broadly related to the difficult area of electronic resource management (ERM); and a paper presenting a perspective of how standards relate to integrating and implementing highly complex systems. The papers are very informative, and I thank Mark, the authors and the current chair of the Standards Committee, Marcia Zeng, for their efforts. Our other feature article concerns search engine technology. Search engine technology is rapidly evolving and is of critical importance to information architecture (IA), among other fields. Many of our recent IA columns under the editorship of Stacy Surla have focused on its critical role. Here Paul Thompson reports for us on the 2008 Infonortics Search Engine Meeting, which provides a comprehensive view of the latest developments. In our IA Column in this issue, Michael Magoolaghan discusses not his work for Vanguard, but his volunteer efforts to help his local library integrate their virtual and physical environments. It is an unusual topic and one that will be of broad interest. Finally, on the ASIS&T side, we have the third installment of Margeaux Johnson's and Nancy Roderer's analysis of the data collected by a recent survey carried out by ASIS&T and Wiley-Blackwell to establish a bench line for the behavior and attitudes of readers and authors of JASIST (the ASIS&T journal) with respect to scholarly publishing prior to implementing the Society's new “Romeo green” access policy. This final piece covers the responses of respondents who said that they had published in open access journals. The problems of scholarly publication are also the subject of Nancy Roderer's President's Page, along with reflections on the future of the Society.

AB  - In our inaugural editorial, we, the incoming Editorial Collective (EC) of Engaging Science, Technology, and Society (ESTS), describe the digital and social infrastructural work that we have undertaken since assuming editorship of the journal. We also note some of the changes we have introduced in terms of the journal’s content and policies. A key argument is that even though publishing infrastructures shape the form and movement of scholarly content in crucial ways, they often remain black-boxed, rendering invisible the time, labor, and skill in developing and sustaining them.

AB  - Open scholarship, such as the sharing of articles, code, data, and educational resources, has the potential to improve university research and education as well as increase the impact universities can have beyond their own walls. To support this perspective, I present evidence from case studies, published literature, and personal experiences as a practicing open scholar. I describe some of the challenges inherent to practicing open scholarship and some of the tensions created by incompatibilities between institutional policies and personal practice. To address this, I propose several concrete actions universities could take to support open scholarship and outline ways in which such initiatives could benefit the public as well as institutions. Importantly, I do not think most of these actions would require new funding but rather a redistribution of existing funds and a rewriting of internal policies to better align with university missions of knowledge dissemination and societal impact.

We describe the RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) project, probably the largest 'open source' bibliographic database. It demonstrates that open-source bibliographic data collection is sustainable.

AB  - This article presents a longitudinal study of global teaching and learning experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study is based on material presented in two articles written 1 year apart from each other by a group of 84 authors from 20 countries. The first article, 'Teaching in the Age of Covid-19', consists of short testimonies and workspace photographs collected between 18 March and 5 May 2020. The second article, 'Teaching in the Age of Covid-19 – One Year Later', consists of short testimonies and workspace photographs collected between 17 March and 31 May 2021. This material is analysed in several different ways. Some parts of the paper treat the testimonies as personal, positional, narratives, while other parts of the paper examine the testimonies for what they represent as data. Readers are invited to read the original testimonies, view the original images and move back and forth between both narratives and data. As narratives, each author has demonstrated their individual postdigital positionality through praxis. As data, these mutually constitutive accounts offer a much larger, powerful commentary, on the position of educators across the globe during this pandemic. The discussion and conclusion blend the two understandings into a postdigital data-narrato-logy, where data and narrative interact in ways similar to interactions between theory and practice within the concept of praxis.

AB  - Risk and technological changes are inexorably linked, and librarians, as experts, must communicate these risks to lay persons and develop appropriate risk management strategies. This paper identifies some of the risks to library primacy, library and professional values, collection integrity, and scholarly communication and the information marketplace that those involved in collection development and acquisition of library materials may encounter. The sources of these risks are briefly described, and the author suggests some risk management strategies.

AB  - The use of advanced high performance computing tools across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities has rapidly expanded in recent years. Several programs have been initiated under the umbrella of e-science with large-scale funding and a wide range of projects. The vision underlying these programs is that new tools will greatly enhance research and enable new forms of global collaboration. This article maps out the different social science approaches to e-science and provides illustrations of how they have been deployed. The aim is to highlight the diversity of these approaches, show complementarities among them, and point to how they may shape the e-science enterprise in years to come.

AB  - Summary Primary and secondary publishers have traditionally defined their role within the scientific communication process in terms of a model in which information flows in a neat, linear way from author/inventor to primary publisher to secondary publisher and back-either directly or through other intermediators and expediters-to me authors and inventors who need the information to support their own research. This “production orientation” model-closely tied to print technology, even though some of its forms are now electronic-continues to function. But these “channels” are increasingly being augmented by electronic alternatives that often defy definition under the production chain model. This paper will share the observations and thoughts of secondary publishers and information providers on trends, focusing on threats and opportunities for scholarly communication.

AB  - The development of digital repositories has been a recent one, starting in late 2000 when the UK's University of Southampton released a software package called E-Prints. Since that time, the establishment of digital repositories has gained momentum. Factors such as the falling costs for online storage, the increase of broadband and gigabit networking technologies, as well as the development of metadata standards to describe repository content, have all contributed to their current popularity. Questions to be asked are: to what extent are digital repositories, as a method for communicating scientific and scholarly information, accepted or are they just hype?; how mature are institutional repositories as a technology?; and, to what extent are institutional repositories used by faculty and researchers? The Gartner hype curve is a tool introduced by the Gartner Group in the 1990s to explain general phenomena of interest in new technologies. This framework plots the typical progression of a technology from its early introduction through its maturation to broad market acceptance. The first question is answered by an investigation into the status of digital repositories in the context of the Gartner hype curve. The second question is answered by plotting institutional repositories on the product life cycle (Sigmoid curve) and the third question is answered by applying the diffusion of innovation theory to institutional repositories.

AB  - This paper describes a novel methodology of data documentation in materials characterization, which has as starting point the creation and usage of any Data Management Plan (DMP) for scientific data in the field of materials science and engineering, followed by the development and exploitation of ontologies for the harnessing of data created through experimental techniques. The case study that is discussed here is nanoindentation, a widely used method for the experimental assessment of mechanical properties on a small scale. The new documentation structure for characterization data (CHADA) is based on the definition of (i) sample, (ii) method, (iii) raw data and (iv) data analysis as the main component of the metadata associated to any characterization experiment. In this way, the relevant information can be stored inside the metadata associated to the experiment. The same methodology can be applicable to a large number of techniques that produce big amount of raw data, while at the same time it can be invaluable tool for big data analysis and for the creation of an open innovation environment, where data can be accessed freely and efficiently. Other fundamental aspects are reviewed in the paper, including the taxonomy and curation of data, the creation of ontology and classification of characterization techniques, the harnessing of data in open innovation environments via database construction along with the retrieval of information via algorithms. The issues of harmonization and standardization of such novel approaches are also critically discussed. Finally, the possible implications for nanomaterial design and the potential industrial impact of the new approach are described and a critical outlook is given.

AB  - Each fiscal year, as academic librarians throughout the United States prepare materials budgets, a national “groan” ensues. Regardless of their format (i.e. print or digital), serial subscription costs are escalating, in the process impacting the role of the library in advancing scholarly communication . This paper examines some of the economic issues concerning open-access (OA) journal publishing. The importance of quantitative literacy is suggested for librarians and academics seeking a better understanding of alternatives to traditional journal subscription models and to anyone considering ventures into OA publishing. Quantitative literacy is essential for managing alternatives to the rising cost of scholarly communication.

AB  - ABSTRACT For ten years CIBER has been studying the logs of scholarly publishers, and what was clear from the very beginning was that scholars conducted very brief visits to websites and spent very little time reading when there, yet publishers envisaged they would dwell; and if not dwell, then at least deep read the PDF later. Yet CIBER's research points to the fact that ‘lite’ reading is in fact endemic: younger people prefer it anyway and older people are getting used to it for the speed and convenience it brings. PDFs are largely a means of archiving and collecting and are not the gold standard reading metric people think. User satisfaction comes not from a PDF but from the ability to deep dive into a site and snatch what you are interested as quickly as possible. Publishers are still not comfortable with that and this article helps explain why they have to be.

AB  - ABSTRACT Digital journals have been widely adopted by academic researchers and have nearly replaced printed journals in many contexts. The adoption of digital books is accelerating. The transition to digital information has changed information workflows of researchers by transforming the methods they use to find, store, retrieve, and use information from monographs, journals, and other sources. It has also changed the needs and expectations of scholars in relation to research information. To investigate these changes, 45 researchers in science, medicine, engineering, social sciences, and humanities at Stanford University were interviewed regarding information workflow and preferences. Results are compared with the findings of the e‐Journal User Study (eJUSt), completed in 2002.

AB  - This study analyzes research articles about open access (OA) indexed by the Scopus database, published from 2001 to 2015, in order to: (a) propose a categorization scheme about OA; (b) categorize the scientific production about OA; and (c) identify research trends on OA through disciplines at international level over time. The authors used descriptive statistical methods and deductive content analysis using an unconstrained matrix in 347 selected research articles. The most explored themes were found to be “overview, current state, and growth of OA” counting for 98 articles (28.2%), and “awareness, perceptions, and attitudes toward OA” for 75 articles (21.6%). As a conclusion, this study reveals a continuous and growing research interest by the OA community in studies focused on case studies regarding the development or evolution of OA in relation to certain groups, institutions, regions, periods, and how different actors perceive and address the OA movement.

AB  - The rapid growth of information and communication technology since the early 1990s has greatly influenced the accessibility of information on a global level and also has played a critical role in restructuring the mechanisms by which specialized academic knowledge is validated, distributed, and made available to consumers. The primary mechanism for validation and distribution of academic knowledge is that of peer-reviewed publication, and it is this mechanism and its intersection with Internet-based electronic publishing that constitute the focus of this study of attitudes toward scholarship presented in electronic formats.

AB  - The open access (OA) movement seeks to ensure that scholarly knowledge is available to anyone with internet access, but being available for free online is of little use if people cannot find open versions. A handful of tools have become available in recent years to help address this problem by searching for an open version of a document whenever a user hits a paywall. This project set out to study how effective four of these tools are when compared to each other and to Google Scholar, which has long been a source of finding OA versions. To do this, the project used Open Access Button, Unpaywall, Lazy Scholar, and Kopernio to search for open versions of 1,000 articles. Results show none of the tools found as many successful hits as Google Scholar, but two of the tools did register unique successful hits, indicating a benefit to incorporating them in searches for OA versions. Some of the tools also include additional features that can further benefit users in their search for accessible scholarly knowledge.

AB  - Business models surrounding scholarly communications have been much debated over the past two decades. However, interest in the discussion has been sharpened in the UK by the funding issues facing the higher education sector, the reality of budget cuts and the need to focus on affordability. There is a growing realization that notions of ‘moderate’ price increases associated with ‘big deals’ over the past ten years will need to be radically reassessed.This paper discusses the financial realities facing UK libraries and the attempt by Research Libraries UK (RLUK) to look for solutions that maintain access to the maximum amount of material possible.

AB  - Despite demonstrated student benefits from Open Educational Resources (OER), especially those in community colleges, faculty adoption remains marginal. This study is framed by diffusion of innovations theory, which acknowledges that adoption of an innovation must exceed a tipping point to ensure enduring success. The study focuses on community college faculty with demonstrated OER engagement, on the basis that these faculty have greater likelihood to adopt OER and help “bridge the chasm.” In surveying faculty, we tested a range of roles librarians have played in supporting OER adoption. Findings show that faculty value librarians’ roles in discovery, cataloging, and information literacy but are less open to librarians operating outside these traditional roles, including mentoring and policy development. Faculty were supportive of librarians’ role in advocacy for OER and, overall, felt that librarians have a role to play in the OER movement on their campuses.

AB  - ABSTRACT For over 200 years copyright law has enabled, and scholars and their publishers have depended on, a state‐granted monopoly, creating ‘artificial scarcity’ to give publishers a period during which they can charge higher prices than the market would otherwise dictate and thus recover their costs, plus (usually) a profit. But today we have instant access to digital works, and easy, worldwide distribution for almost no cost to the reader beyond those of computers, Internet access, and electricity. The monopolistic mechanism of ‘artificial scarcity’ now turns one of the most critical advantages of the digital world into something to be fought tooth and nail. The solution is not stronger and longer copyrights. It more likely will emerge from experimentation to find business models that can fund the creation of works, still a costly undertaking, without sacrificing the digital benefit of almost free distribution to everyone who might desire to access them.

AB  - Open access (OA) publications play an important role for academia, policy-makers, and practitioners. Universities and research institutions set up OA policies and provide authors different types of support for engaging in OA activities. This paper presents a case study on OA publishing in a scholarly community, drawing on qualitative and quantitative data gained from workshops and a survey. As the authors are the managing editors of the OA eJournal for eDemocracy and Open Government (JeDEM), the aim was to collect data and insights on the publication choices of authors interested in OA publishing and other crucial factors such as personal attitudes to publishing, institutional context, and digital literacy in order to improve the journal. In the first phase, two workshops with different stakeholders were held at the Conference for e-Democracy and Open Government (CeDEM) held in Austria and in South Korea in 2016. In the second phase, an online survey was sent to all the users of the e-journal JeDEM in October 2019. From the workshops, key differences regarding OA perception and strategies between the stakeholder groups were derived. Participants strongly perceived OA publishing as a highly individualist matter embedded within a publishing culture emphasizing reputation and rankings. The survey results, however, showed that institutional support differs considerably for authors. Factors such as visibility, reputation, and impact play the biggest role for the motivation to publish OA. The results from both inquiries provide a better understanding of OA publishing attitudes and the relevant digital literacies but also suggest the need to investigate further the enablers or difficulties of scholarship, particularly in a digital context. They clearly point to the potential of regularly addressing the users of the journal as well as communicating with them the more nuanced aspects of OA publishing, non-traditional metrics, or respective digital literacies, in order to reduce misconceptions about OA and to support critical stances.

AB  - If we were to start from scratch today to design a quality-controlled archive and distribution system for scientific and technical information, it could take a very different form from what has evolved in the past decade from pre-existing print infrastructure. Ultimately, we might expect some form of global knowledge network for research communications. Over the next decade, there are many technical and non-technical issues to address along the way, everything from identifying optimal formats and protocols for rendering, indexing, linking, querying, accessing, mining, and transmitting the information, to identifying sociological, legal, financial, and political obstacles to realization of ideal systems. What near-term advances can we expect in automated classification systems, authoring tools, and next-generation document formats to facilitate efficient data mining and long-term archival stability? How will the information be authenticated and quality controlled? What differences should be expected in the realization of these systems for different scientific research fields? Can recent technological advances provide not only more efficient means of accessing and navigating the information, but also more cost-effective means of authentication and quality control? Relevant experiences from open electronic distribution of research materials in physics and related disciplines during the past decade are used to illuminate these questions, and some of their implications for proposals to improve the implementation of peer review are then discussed.

AB  - Several studies have highlighted the critical role of academic digital libraries in providing research support services and improving research performance. Although several studies have discussed the value of realizing this role, a business model that can serve as a reference in carrying out this role is not yet available. This research aimed to propose a business model and a prototype design for Indonesia’s academic digital library for research support services. A focus group discussion was conducted involving nine experts to identify the key factors. They were then mapped onto a Business Model Canvas. The key activities in the business model guided the requirements gathering for developing a prototype. The requirements were obtained from the literature reviews with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The requirements were validated by interviewing library managers, research unit managers, and information technology managers. This research resulted in the academic digital library Business Model Canvas and the proposed prototype design, which consisted of a mobile application for member users and a back-office application to manage services by librarians. Further research on prototype implementation testing and the development of a successful implementation model is needed to strengthen this research.

AB  - The value of blogs and bloggers in science is well recognized. Blogs serve as an excellent form of post-publication peer review and host much of the scientific discussion that occurs on the web today. Indeed, it is probably true that more interaction between scientists and between scientists and the public occurs away from traditional scientific articles themselves and in “alternative” forums such as Twitter, Facebook, and of course, blogs. These mediums are becoming increasingly important in scholarly discourse and often times shape what is written in traditional scholarly articles themselves (i.e. they are often cited). But for all the benefits blogs provide they are not afforded an equal footing. They are superfluous and can disappear without a trace. We want to change that. The content of these discussions can sway opinion and act as authoritative sources in their own right. Blogs are without a doubt valuable and as such deserve to be archived and aggregated, just like traditional scholarly publications are. They deserve to “count,” to be elevated to a level that is not viewed as something extra but as something integral to scientific communication (Nicholson 2014, Nicholson 2015). We need to get around the notion that where you publish actually matters. It doesn’t. It is the content, not the wrapper, and the sooner we act accordingly, the better. So without further ado….Today we are happy to announce that you can now assign a digital object identifier (DOI) to your Wordpress.org blog via The Winnower. This is a first step of many that we are taking towards bringing scientific publishing into the modern era (we’ll soon be releasing an interface for Blogger blogs and Wordpress.com blogs). We hope you’ll help us create this “agora of the modern age” by participating and by letting us know what you think needs changing or improving. Of course, one way to do that is to publish with us and another is to write a blog post! Together we can create an archived virtual library that is accessible to not only those that can pay thousands of dollars to publish but to all. If you have a Wordpress.org blog you can start by downloading our plugin here to start assigning DOIs to your blogs instantly. DIY scholarly publishing is here. References Nicholson, J. M. 2014.

AB  - Purpose While distribution channels of theses and dissertations have changed significantly in the digital age, they are generally still considered grey literature. This paper aims to argue the applicability of the concept of grey to electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). Design/methodology/approach The paper is presented as a debate between two contradictory opinions on the application of the grey literature concept to ETDs. Findings The paper provides a definition of grey literature and then discusses its application to electronic dissertations and theses. In particular, it assesses the aspects of acquisition, quality, access and preservation. Some arguments highlight the “grey nature” of ETDs, such as the limited access via institutional and other repositories. Other arguments (e.g. the development of ETD infrastructures and the quality of ETDs) question this grey approach to ETDs. The paper concludes that “greyness” remains a challenge for ETDs, a problem waiting for solution on the way to open science through the application of the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability reusability) principles. Research limitations implications Library and information science (LIS) professionals and scientists should be careful about using the concept of grey literature. The debate will help academic librarians and LIS researchers to better understand the nature of grey literature and its coverage, here in the field of ETDs. Originality/value Some definitions from the print age may not be applicable to the digital age. The contradictory character of the debate helps clarify the similitudes and differences of grey literature and ETDs and highlights the challenge of ETDs, in particular, their accessibility and findability.

AB  - Watch the VIDEO of the presentation.“Fight academic apartheid to advance equality and quality in the sciences!”“Stop discriminating against Open Access publications in research evaluation.”“The next generation of researchers will care less about status and more about relevance.”These are some of the voices from Europe’s rectors, vice-chancellors, professors, senior and junior researchers on what still needs to be done to achieve more Open Access.Despite seeing significant international and national Open Access policy development across Europe, both the library and academic communities are still having challenges in implementing Open Access policies on various levels. We can anticipate far more OA take-up when the research community and senior administration votes with their feet against traditional publishing practices and for new forms. In addition, these groups have the power to stabilise and strengthen the sustainability of such change by changing the way that research is currently being assessed and evaluated. It is for this reason that SPARC Europe is highlighting the importance of the people in our research communities who are helping make Open Access happen and who are speaking out for such change.SPARC Europe is doing this by bringing champions together in an online showcase, Europe’s Open Access Champions. This features a range of academics and senior administrators or champions who are making the case for Open Access amongst their peers. They are generating more momentum for more access to Europe’s research results within their research communities. They tell us why and how – in their own words – on the Europe’s Open Access Champions site.In the first instance, this presentation will share a range of complementary but also very different views from champions from various research roles, disciplines and countries. What needs to be done to change the current scholarly publishing system in their view? Where does academic integrity come in and how can more OA here potentially affect research careers / employment conditions? Above all, how can the academic community make the necessary change to the way research is currently assessed and evaluated to make OA work? The presentation will then go on to share lessons learnt by various libraries across Europe on what makes a good OA champion.To conclude, this presentation seeks to inspire the open scholarly communication community to engage more with champions from the research community who have the potential to make more rapid Open Access to Europe’s research results.

AB  - Collection management (as opposed to collection development) should be understood as the activity of adding value to—or deleting value from—objects of information subsequent to their selection. The management of materials in traditional formats will become increasingly problematic the more we move into an online environment. Although digital resources will sooner or later come to dominate scholarly communication, the effective management of traditional materials will remain essential. While a central goal of libraries must be to manage traditional and digital resources as two aspects of a single service, we must also recognize that all information services will eventually be conditioned by a digital mentality. In order to start planning now for collection management to play a more prominent role in the future of information services, we must begin to define with as much precision as possible the abstract values collection management adds to and deletes from selected information objects.

AB  - I consider it a "given" that the contribution of academic and research libraries was a central element in the success of the mission of higher education in the twentieth century. That premise leads to a difficult question—does it matter if libraries continue to be central in the century just beginning? Here I will make a second assumption—that it really does matter a great deal. At the risk of sounding pessimistic, it helps to understand the obstacles to re-positioning libraries successfully so that they may continue their vital contribution of providing access to scholarly information. These are largely beyond our immediate ability to remedy. That does not mean we should not try to understand them and to find the allies who can help us do the work of shaping the future of libraries—and there are many such allies. During the last two years, I have written closely allied pieces that have appeared in these pages exploring several topics that in my view are critical to the question of the future of libraries—on change, on the so-called "paradigm shift" and on intellectual property. In large measure, this essay is a capstone for all of them. 1

AB  - In this communication, we look at Open Access (OA) publishing practices in geochemistry. We examine a list of 56 journals and assess whether Article Processing Charges (APCs) and Journal Impact Factors (JIFs) appear to influence publication or not. More than 40% of articles in 2018–2019 were published OA, and about 70% of that portion in fully OA journals. These had a mean APC of US$ 900, whereas the remaining were published in hybrid journals with a higher mean APC of more than $US 1,800. A moderate and positive correlation is found between the number of OA articles published in hybrids journals and their JIF, whereas there is a stronger positive relationship between the number of OA articles published in fully OA journals and the APC. For OA articles published in hybrid journals, it seems that the proportion of OA articles tends to increase in journals with higher JIF.

AB  - ABSTRACT Academics and librarians have worked in tandem for many years to broaden access to the scholarship they create, scrutinize, collect, and consume. Recent developments have focused on campus faculty advocating for change by developing self-imposed open access policies. Such policy developments have occurred in an evolutionary process, the beginnings of which might be identified as the “serials crisis” peaking in the 1990s, followed by the focus on efforts to examine and reform broken aspects of the system of scholarly communication, and most recently the feasibility of faculty-initiated open access policies on university campuses. This article provides an analysis of one university's 10- year evolution to an open access policy focusing primarily on its advocates’ lessons learned and the library's role in order to add the perspective of a public institution's experience.

AB  - The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) protocol for metadata harvesting offers the prospect of resource discovery tools far beyond what is currently available to users of the Web via standard search engines. This article illustrates how existing information about available resources can be repurposed fairly easily and cheaply using standard tools. However the publishing of this information throws up a number of practical and philosophical questions which have to be addressed by projects and institutions.

AB  - Many Earth science disciplines are currently experiencing the emergence of new ways of data publication and the establishment of an information technology infrastructure for data archiving and exchange. Building on efforts to standardize data and metadata publication in geochemistry [ Staudigel et al. , 2002], here we discuss options for data publication, archiving and exchange. All of these options have to be structured to meet some minimum requirements of scholarly publication, in particular reliability of archival, reproducibility and falsifiability. All data publication and archival methods should strive to produce databases that are fully interoperable and this requires an appropriate data and metadata interchange protocol. To accomplish the latter we propose a new Metadata Interchange Format (.mif) that can be used for more effective sharing of data and metadata across digital libraries, data archives, and research projects. This is not a proposal for a particular set of metadata parameters but rather of a methodology that will enable metadata parameter sets to be easily developed and interchanged between research organizations. Examples are provided for geochemical data as well as map images to illustrate the flexibility of the approach.

AB  - As biological disciplines extend into the 'big data' world, they will need a names-based infrastructure to index and interconnect distributed data. The infrastructure must have access to all names of all organisms if it is to manage all information. Those who compile lists of species hold different views as to the intellectual property rights that apply to the lists. This creates uncertainty that impedes the development of a much-needed infrastructure for sharing biological data in the digital world. The laws in the United States of America and European Union are consistent with the position that scientific names of organisms and their compilation in checklists, classifications or taxonomic revisions are not subject to copyright. Compilations of names, such as classifications or checklists, are not creative in the sense of copyright law. Many content providers desire credit for their efforts. A 'blue list' identifies elements of checklists, classifications and monographs to which intellectual property rights do not apply. To promote sharing, authors of taxonomic content, compilers, intermediaries, and aggregators should receive citable recognition for their contributions, with the greatest recognition being given to the originating authors. Mechanisms for achieving this are discussed.

AB  - Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries: Issues and Solutions is a collection of ten articles about issues of electronic access and use of books and journals in medical libraries. Management of electronic resources has become an essential function for medical libraries. “These papers offer some solutions to the issues surrounding electronic resources, and indicate areas for further research” (p. 3).Subjects of the papers include costs and challenges of shifting collections from print to electronic materials; collaborative arrangements and cost sharing that may save on the cost of bundled electronic journals; models for pricing electronic journals, development of electronic journals, and history of pricing; development of open access scholarly publishing and ways open access affects the pricing of subscription journals; and the issue of open access publishing and desired relief for library budgets.Another topic emerges from the development of the new and primarily digital Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (WCMC-Q). The WCMC-Q is the first US medical school located outside the United States. “In Qatar, the Distributed eLibrary is accessed via more than 100 computers placed in offices, classrooms, labs, and clusters throughout the medical branch building and accessible through wired and wireless networks” (p. 28).Cooperative activities—initiatives to improve access to health information in Latin America and the Caribbean regions—offer “a perspective on how such limitations were overcome through the establishment in 1967 of a cooperative network between the Pan American Health Organization and Latin America and Caribbean countries” (p. 42). One instance involves two libraries that collaborate to share an electronic journal management system, TDNet, and reviews the implementation of the system. Another example covers the provision of mediated document delivery to off-campus students from the library's online collections or from interlibrary loan. It is of interest that the program does not require students to find the articles themselves.Other topics include the development of a web-based online catalog that integrated the e-collection and the print collection and the peculiar reluctance of courts to permit suits in negligence and strict liability against publishers for erroneous information that leads to harm (p. 101) and reviews of implications for medical libraries.In searching WorldCat for similar books about electronic information resources, this reviewer identified eight titles, but none were specific to medical libraries aside from this book and the Medical Library Association's DocKit #3: Collection Development and Management for Electronic, Audiovisual, and Print Resources in Health Sciences Libraries [1]. As one of only two books cited in WorldCat, this compilation fills a need and makes helpful suggestions for further research. Technology is advancing so rapidly and e-resources are so vital to health care that this book would be helpful to medical libraries in managing resources.

AB  - This study draws on the authors' first-hand experience of designing, developing and delivering (3Ds) a massive open online course (MOOC) entitled 'Understanding Research Methods' since 2014, largely but not exclusively for learners in the humanities and social sciences. The greatest challenge facing us was to design an assessment mechanism that was (i) rigorous yet practicable at scale, vis-à-vis over 60,000 students from highly diverse backgrounds; (ii) compatible with the pedagogical orientation of the MOOC provider; and (iii) meaningful to the nature of the course subject. Based on a network analysis of forum interactions and a qualitative analysis of a random sample of 116 research questions proposed by students, we explore how participants' understanding of research methods developed through a series of carefully sequenced 'e-tivities' and 'open peer assessments' over the duration of the course. The aim of this study was to consider a model of 'flipped' assessment, drawn from elements of 'paragogy' and the IR Model that acknowledges and exploits peer learning opportunities that are not routinely captured by completion statistics.

AB  - Scholarly data, such as academic articles, research reports and theses/dissertations, traditionally have limited dissemination in that they generally require journal subscription or affiliation with particular libraries. The notion of open access, made possible by rapidly advancing digital technologies, aims to break the limitations that hinder academic developments and information exchange. This paper presents the Electronic Thesis &amp; Dissertation (ETD) Project at the Simon Fraser University Library, British Columbia, Canada, and discusses various technological considerations associated with the Project including selection of software, capture of metadata, and long-term preservation of the digitized data. The paper concludes that a well-established project plan that takes into account not only technological issues but also issues relating to project policies, procedures, and copyright permissions that occur in the process of providing open access plays a vital role for the overall success of such projects.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article is a revised version of a talk given at the ALPSP seminar of the same name in February 2005. The current state of play with electronic‐only (‘e‐only’) journals is reviewed, along with some data on the different ways print and electronic editions are used. The drivers for and against a move to e‐only journals are discussed, including economic and commercial issues, long‐term access and preservation, and the growing divergence between the capabilities of print and electronic journals.

AB  - A number of attempts have been made to determine the key competencies for librarians supporting scholarly communications (SC), but it remains unclear what technical competencies are required. To explore this issue, the study undertook thematic analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews with UK based librarians working in SC. Typical technologies in use were identified and six typical ways of talking about technologies uncovered. Partly because of the out-sourcing of key technologies, SC librarians need soft skills and certain positive orientations to technology rather than practical technical skills. They acquire these skills through learning on the job and through communities of learning. A concept of socio-technological competence is proposed to encapsulate this skillset.

KW  - Topic Modeling
AB  - Over the last few years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as the most important breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) that fundamentally transform research and developments in the field. ChatGPT represents one of the most exciting LLM systems developed recently to showcase impressive skills for language generation and highly attract public attention. Among various exciting applications discovered for ChatGPT in English, the model can process and generate texts for multiple languages due to its multilingual training data. Given the broad adoption of ChatGPT for English in different problems and areas, a natural question is whether ChatGPT can also be applied effectively for other languages or it is necessary to develop more language-specific technologies. The answer to this question requires a thorough evaluation of ChatGPT over multiple tasks with diverse languages and large datasets (i.e., beyond reported anecdotes), which is still missing or limited in current research. Our work aims to fill this gap for the evaluation of ChatGPT and similar LLMs to provide more comprehensive information for multilingual NLP applications. In particular, we evaluate ChatGPT on 7 different tasks, covering 37 diverse languages with high, medium, low, and extremely low resources. Compared to the performance of previous models, our extensive experiments demonstrate the worse performance of ChatGPT for different NLP tasks and languages, calling for further research to develop better models and understanding for multilingual learning.

AB  - The institutional repository at the University of Florida (IR@UF) was founded in 2006, and the policies have not been substantially reviewed or updated since that time.As the new institutional repository (IR) manager, I set out to create a list of current IR best practices and policies from peer institutions.Once collected, this list would serve as a guide to identify needed updates that would allow the IR@UF to best address the needs of the UF community within the current scholarly publishing environment.The first step was a literature review to identify policies necessary for a thriving IR.I then compared current IR@UF policies, both public and internal, to identify where there were missing or weak policies.Evaluating the size of their IRs, years they were founded, and the types of objects collected, we identified 25 peer institutions.I did an environmental scan of these IRs by visiting their websites, searching for documentation of policies and practices.With the help of our assessment librarian, Laura Spears, I created a Qualtrics survey, drawing from the environmental scan to craft focused questions about policies in four areas: administration, submissions, collections, and other (e.g., theses and dissertations, how related items are treated, etc.).I invited the 25 peer institutions to participate in the survey as a pilot; 15 replied.Using these results and feedback from peers, I updated the survey and sent it to a broader audience, yielding 94 domestic and international participants.Some trends were easily identifiable, such as a majority of IRs being hosted on the DSpace or Digital Commons platforms, and spikes in creation of IRs in 2006, 2011, and 2015.Also present were general trends of how metadata was collected to describe items within the IR, and who set and maintained policies.Initial policies were developed mostly by advisory boards or a library department, while maintenance was primarily handled by a library department or an individual.This qualitative analysis began as a way to measure the IR@UF policies and suggest policy revisions.The results of this research speak to broader implications.It is clear the state of institutional repositories within the scope of scholarly communication is currently under scrutiny, as evidenced by recent articles such as Clifford Lynch's 2017 article, "Updating the Agenda for Academic Libraries and Scholarly Communications," 1 and "The Evolving Institutional Repository Landscape, a Choice White Paper" by Judy Luther, 2 released earlier this year.Recent surveys of the current landscape of IRs look at topics from metadata collection to the creation and maintenance of IRs in Canada, as well as the use of Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations for student works in IRs.Within this focus on IRs, understanding the policies of peer institutions is an important factor.My survey provides results from 94 participants, and serves as a case study other institutions can review based on their needs in comparison to peer institutions.The results of the survey also suggest further research opportunities into the relationship between IR platform and policies.

AB  - College textbook costs increased at three times the rate of inflation between 2002 and 2012 (United States General Accounting Office [GAO], 2013). One solution to high textbook costs is Open Educational Resources (OER) and institutional librarians, because of their reach throughout the institution and particular skillsets, are keenly positioned to make the business case for OER and become leaders of the OER movement. This article discusses the issues most relevant to OER adoption and provides an environmental scan of OER resources currently available to institutions, faculty, and students.

AB  - Introduction As is relatively well known, Henry Oldenburg, the first Joint Secretary of the then newly founded Royal Society of London, published in 1665 the world's first scholarly journal, Philosophical Transactions. Oldenburg established the journal to fulfill four functions that continue today as part of the scholarly communication process: registration, which ensures the article is connected to the author as well as the intellectual property right holder; certification of the quality of the research through peer review; dissemination of the research; and archiving to ensure historical preservation and future availability of research. The scholarly publishing system remained confined largely to learned societies for roughly the following three centuries, until commercial publishers began to recognize and exploit the profit potential of academic literature. Sustained annual growth in the number of journals and articles, accompanied by aggressive merger and acquisition activity among the major publishing conglomerates, has resulted in a contemporary multi-billion dollar industry dominated by a handful of publishing behemoths that extract immense resources from institutions of higher education based on the free labour of academics. And while the largest of the commercial publishers that now dominate the academic publishing ecosystem declare that they are vital to ensuring the effective discharge of the key aspects of the scholarly communication system, the proposed paper will suggest that their command and extreme rent-seeking behavior is parasitic on scholarly communication and ultimately stymies the system. Moreover, and this is the more novel element of the argument to be developed, this stranglehold is superfluous and could be loosened in a way that would restore substantial control over the academic journal publishing system to stakeholders and institutions more closely aligned with the interests of the actual producers and users of scholarly works. Considered in broad brush strokes, the paper will argue that contemporary information and communication techologies, in tandem with open source digital publishing management platforms, have made it technologically, logistically, and financially feasible for scholarly journal publishing to be reclaimed by members of the academy through their non-profit university presses and libraries in ways that would respond to the serials crisis experienced by academic libraries while ensuring fidelity to the traditional processes of the scholarly communication system. A General Overview of the Western Academic Publishing Industry According to the most recent data collected by the consulting firm Outsell, revenues in 2011 for the science-publishing industry amounted to US$9.4 billion. Based on 1.8 million English-language articles published annually by 3,500 publishers in 27,000 journals, this figure translates into gross revenue of slightly more than US$5,200 per article [as cited in 1].i The academic publishing industry is now dominated by ten major corporations. The top three publishers of scientific journals (Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley-Blackwell) account for approximately 42 percent of all articles published. In part, this concentrated degree of control has been made possible because these large commercial publishers have been very successful in acquiring many of the most prestigious and high-circulation journals across almost all academic disciplines. In an attempt to justify the high rents they extract when selling access to the knowledge created by academic labourers, publishers typically invoke claims about adding value to the broader knowledge ecology. Such assertions completely sidestep the reality that unpaid academic labour provides the content, peer-review, and editorial work (although a few publishers pay editors a small stipend, it is typically well below the true value of the person's efforts) being appropriated by journal publishers. These types of claims also occlude the additional time and money burdens typically downloaded onto authors should their manuscript contain colour material, or require copyright release for images and other copyrighted material they might want to incorporate into their work. And even this value-added work is appropriated by publishers who coerce authors into surrendering their intellectual property rights as a precondition for publication. Open Access Responses In response to several of the trends in the academic publishing industry that have clearly disadvantaged both authors and libraries – that is, the producers and the purchasers of scholarly output – a sustained movement has emerged over the last decade and a half that advocates for and develops open-access models to academic research. The two dominant accepted models for delivering open access to scholarly works are known as 'Gold' and 'Green' open access. Gold open access refers to peer-reviewed publication in an open-access journal, whereas Green open access involves deposit of the work in an institutional or subject electronic repository. Beyond the mounting success of the Green model that relies on repositories, recent research provides additional evidence that open-access journal publishing has matured into a sustainable form of scholarly publication [2]. As might also be expected given such monumental growth, open-access infrastructure and technical applications have advanced considerably. In particular, Open Journal Systems, a journal management and publishing system developed by the Public Knowledge Project, has become a widely used software platform by over 5,800 open-access journals. Unfortunately, the corporate publishing oligarchs have also recognized the capital accumulation opportunities offered by open-access models. All of the leading corporate academic publishers now offer Green and Gold open-access options at a range of different, and exorbitant, price points (e.g., depending on the publisher and the journal, Green open-access options can be purchased for US$1,500 and Gold open access tends to run between US$2,000 and US$3,000). The fact that there is such a range of article processing charges indicates that they are less a reflection of actual production costs and instead based more on a calculus of what the market will bear. Clearly, open access per se will not necessarily improve the long-term financial sustainability of the scholarly communication system. Instead, these corporate adaptations to open access represent a direct response by commercial publishers to subvert the open-access model in service of their own accumulation imperatives. Indeed, according to analysts at Bernstein Research, which upgraded its stock outlook for Reed Elsevier in September 2014 to market-perform from underperform in 2011, open access has done little to challenge the market strength of the leading subscription publishers. Instead, these analysts suggest that open-access funding models may actually be contributing to the profits of scientific, technical, and medical (STM) journal publishers. This assessment has certainly been borne out in the case of Elsevier, which has been steadily increasing its operating profit margins over the last few years for its STM journals: 36 percent (£724 million) in 2010, 37 percent (£768 million) in 2011, 38 percent (£780 million) in 2012, and 39 percent (£826 million) in 2013. These same analysts predict further consolidation of the industry, which would favour the larger players such as Elsevier [3]. Toward a More Substantive Transformation of the Scholarly Publishing System All academics, but especially tenured faculty, need to be reminded of their role in the broader knowledge ecology and the constraining effects that the current commercial model of journal publishing exercises on this ecology. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is critical since academics benefit from their work being widely disseminated and used (and hopefully cited), not from royalty streams. Put more directly, there is a disconnect between the factors motivating the typical academic writer and the profit maximising behaviour of commercial publishers. Academics provide the majority of labour that sustains the production of scholarly knowledge, including the actual research and writing, peer review, and editing. It is time for academics to re-appropriate from for-profit publishers the products and processes of our collective labour in order to revitalise the knowledge commons in ways that serve the public good rather than commercial accumulation imperatives. And although this might require significant amounts of persuasion among some of our more conservative colleagues, I suggest that logistically such a re-appropriation would be less difficult. There already exists a basic publishing infrastructure in the form of non-profit university presses, which should be able to substitute easily for commercial publishers in ways that would not require the assignment of copyright by authors or the imposition of onerous pricing and licensing contracts on library customers. Indeed, university presses have substantial historical experience in facilitating the dissemination of scholarly research across multiple product lines (trade books, scholarly monographs, textbooks, and journals). And, as pointed out above, there exist freely available, technologically sophisticated digital publishing platforms (e.g., Open Journal Systems) of which university presses could avail themselves. I therefore believe that university presses are best positioned to fulfill the key aspects of the scholarly communication system in ways that would promote access while also remedying the fiscal instability of the current corporate-dominated model. Moreover, and this is the part of the paper that will be further elaborated for the conference, university presses can partner with the increasing number of university libraries that have coalesced through the Library Publishing Coalition project. This group of 60 North American academic libraries has committed itself to expanding the nascent field of library publishing in collaboration with university presses and learned societies. The findings reported in this part of the paper will outline some of the lessons and best practices learned so far by this group of librarians who are actively seeking to collaboratively transform academic publishing into a commonist endeavour better aligned with the production processes and consumption practices of the actual producers and consumers of academic research. Conclusions Commercial control of academic publishing through strategies and practices such as industry consolidation and forced assignment of copyright represents an appropriation and enclosure of the knowledge commons that otherwise would emerge from the unrestricted flow of academic research. Put another way, commercial control of academic publishing expedites the private expropriation of much of the value that is produced in common through the cooperative relationships inherent in scholarly production. Yet such appropriation and enclosure need not be tolerated. The success of the open-access movement and models has demonstrated that there are viable alternatives to the commercial control of academic publishing. However, the dominant open-access regime suffers from inherent neutrality in respect of economic model that renders it susceptible to commercial appropriation and exploitation. The author-pay model does nothing to destruct the commodity logic of academic publishing but instead merely transfers the revenue source from users/readers to the actual producers (authors), which introduces yet another level of exploitation of the producers. Thus, while sympathetic to the goals and objectives of (Gold) open access, I assert that the more formidable imbalance in the scholarly publishing system is the presence and substantial control exercised by for-profit publishers. I therefore believe that we need to become more radical in our thinking and our actions in order to wrest control of academic publishing from the current commercial publishing oligarchs. A group of academic librarians, through their institutions, has begun to try and actively re-appropriate such control. The review and assessment of selected examples of collaborative publishing projects being undertaken by some university presses and academic libraries shines an optimistic light on efforts to exert autonomous self-control over our knowledge commons.

AB  - The widening gap between constituents' demands for materials and research libraries' abilities to meet those demands calls for new strategies or emphases by those libraries. It may be expected that patron demands will exert increasing influence over the allocation of materials budgets and those data on use of materials will drive or guide collection development. Are such data, which can be provided by automated systems, being used to guide collection development ? Responses to a survey reveal that, with few exceptions, they are not.

AB  - SUMMARY As serial prices rise exponentially and budgets plummet, serials aficionados can still increase access to information by adding bibliographic records for open access journals to library catalogs. Anna Hood shared procedures and practices on how she is adding value to her library's catalog by adding such records. Bridging the gap between users and open access journals in such a manner allows for true openness. An open access journal is not truly “open” unless we take the time to unrestrict and make them available to all.

AB  - ABSTRACT There is a strong history of social science research within Latin America, but its visibility (both within and outside the region) has been low for reasons of language and print distribution. The introduction of the Internet and online publication makes this information potentially more visible to the global research community, and within Latin America several organizations have undertaken to exploit this opportunity. The approaches taken show how collaboration between countries, and particularly between librarians and publishers, can provide innovative solutions. The CLACSO project uses a digital library model as a publishing platform for its member journals and this has provided a successful – and hopefully sustainable – model.

AB  - In the context of Open Access to scientific and scholarly literature, repositories, both institutional and subject-based, have come to play an important role. However, the nature of repositories appears to be difficult to pin down as each category of people involved seems to have a different vision. The shifting interpretation of repositories has been a source of weakness in the promotion of these instruments. It is suggested here that this situation is not unique to repositories; on the contrary, all sociotechnical objects go through such a phase if we are to follow some of the important studies coming from the “Social construction of technology” school of thought. This suggests that technical objects succeed when relevant social groups interpret the meaning and function of a particular technology. By examining a number of events around repositories, in particular struggles around the possibility of mandating deposits, it is possible to identify a number of relevant social groups, as well as examine how they can either ally with each other or are displaying conflictual fault-lines between them. Using this form of analysis should help develop strategies to develop repositories.

AB  - This document reflects the distributed administrative structure to be put into practice by the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) group for the purpose of governing itself as it carries out work on its Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI)-funded initiative. The INKE group consists of academic researchers, academic research partners (many invested as stakeholders as well), an international advisory board, a partners committee, individual research area groups (RAG) each with their own (co)leads who act as administrators for the group and form the overall RAG administrative group committee, and an executive committee (EC) that represents all areas of activity in the research endeavour and also includes an administrative/ management advisor (who carries out work and provides leadership on process, not research content) and a project manager. Taken as a whole, the structure of the group is an embodiment of the distributed administrative and authoritative principles that have evolved over the several years of the project's foundation, and the materials that follow have been assembled and authored by the entirety of the administrative team in that spirit. This document is also closely aligned with the processes outlined in two related documents: the annual calendar and the annual RAG planning process.

AB  - Digital scholarship issues are increasingly prevalent in today’s environment. We are faced with questions of how to protect our own works as well as others’ with responsible attribution and usage, sometimes involving a formal agreement. These may come in the form of Creative Commons Licensing, provisions of the U.S. Copyright Act, or terms of use outlined by contractual agreements with library vendors. Librarians at Eastern Carolina University and Kansas State University (K-State) are among several university libraries now providing services to assist with navigating these sometimes legalistic frameworks. East Carolina University Libraries are taking initiatives to familiarize faculty, researchers, and students with Open Educational Resources and Creative Commons Licensing. At K-State, librarians in digital scholarship and electronic resources identified the overlap of their subject matters through their correspondence regarding users’ copyright and licensing questions; a partnership formed, and they implemented a proactive and public-facing approach to better meet user needs and liability concerns at a major research university.

AB  - Purpose Research support services (RSS) is an emerging and popular area in university libraries, whose increasing importance has been well documented since the early 2010s. This study aims to identify the status of RSS provided in the university libraries of Pakistan and to compare the results with relevant international studies. The research also reports on the perception of librarians regarding the application of RSS in Pakistani university libraries. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative survey was conducted of the chief librarians/head librarians working in the 175 university libraries of Pakistan. A structured questionnaire was designed and pre-tested with national and international research experts, faculty members and library professionals. SPSS was used to calculate descriptive statistics. Results of the study were compared with previous literature from an international perspective. Findings Results of the study indicated that most of the university libraries are providing basic RSS and that they have good collections of both general and subject-specific works to meet the needs of researchers. Most respondents not only were interested in providing RSS but also emphasized that libraries should upgrade their collection to meet researchers’ requirements. However, results of the study also indicated that there was noticeably less support for both the more advanced and newer research support services. Practical implications Because the delivery of RSS enables libraries to help meet a university’s strategic research goals, the findings will be of interest to university library and information science executives, policymakers and administration. The suggested recommendations highlight those service areas which are most in need of improvement. Originality/value This research provides an updated perspective on the delivery of research support services by university libraries in Pakistan.

AB  - In recent years, library users have shifted from searching in library catalogs and scholarly databases to searching in library discovery systems. This shift has introduced a fundamental change in the information-seeking process. Discovery systems provide access to a large, diverse information landscape of scholarly materials regardless of where the materials are located, what format they are in, and whether the library owns them or subscribes to them. At the same time, these systems typically offer simple, Google-like searching as the default option, to accommodate the expectations of today’s users. With this type of searching, users do not spend much time formulating queries, and their queries often yield large result sets; therefore, discovery systems focus on relevance ranking and on tools that help users easily navigate and refine result sets. Librarians have welcomed the advances in discovery services for their users. However, this new reality poses challenges to the practices that librarians have developed over the years and, in some cases, is at odds with the systematic, controlled approach to searching endorsed by librarians. Examinations of information-seeking and information-searching models together with a review of new technological capabilities of library discovery systems show why such systems help today’s searchers and facilitate their research more than the traditional systems.

AB  - Abstract In the process of scientific research, many information objects are generated, all of which may remain valuable indefinitely. However, artifacts such as instrument data and associated calibration information may have little value in isolation; their meaning is derived from their relationships to each other. Individual artifacts are best represented as components of a life cycle that is specific to a scientific research domain or project. Current cataloging practices do not describe objects at a sufficient level of granularity nor do they offer the globally persistent identifiers necessary to discover and manage scholarly products with World Wide Web standards. The Open Archives Initiative's Object Reuse and Exchange data model (OAI‐ORE) meets these requirements. We demonstrate a conceptual implementation of OAI‐ORE to represent the scientific life cycles of embedded networked sensor applications in seismology and environmental sciences. By establishing relationships between publications, data, and contextual research information, we illustrate how to obtain a richer and more realistic view of scientific practices. That view can facilitate new forms of scientific research and learning. Our analysis is framed by studies of scientific practices in a large, multidisciplinary, multi‐university science and engineering research center, the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing.

AB  - SUMMARY This paper is based on a presentation given by Loretta Ebert, Director of the Rensselaer Research Libraries at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. It followed a presentation given by Kenneth Frazier similarly titled, “What's the Big Deal?” in which he discussed his institution's rationale for avoiding Big Deals. In this paper, the utilization of the Big Deal by a consortium of independent academic libraries in New York State provides an example of emerging models of collaboration among libraries that demonstrate cost-effective use of Big Deals, value-added collections and improved access for scholars regardless of their institutional affiliations. A shared electronic collection provides a case study for analyzing variable cost and usage data across members of a consortium and the elements that contributed to a successful collaboration.

AB  - In the five years since the launch of the Budapest Open Access Initiative in February 2002, one of the most striking developments in the scholarly communications landscape has been the increasing interest taken in open access at a policy level. Today, open access (in the form of both self-archiving and open access journals) is routinely discussed and debated at an institutional-level, within research-funding bodies, nationally, and internationally. The debate has moved out of the library and publisher communities to take a more central place in discussions on the ‘knowledge economy’, return on investment in research, and the nature of e-science. This paper looks at some of the public policy drivers that are impacting on scholarly communications and describes the major policy initiatives that are supporting a move to open access.

AB  - INTRODUCTION The Accessibility Quotient (AQ), a new measure for assisting authors and librarians in assessing and characterizing the degree of accessibility for a group of papers, is proposed and described. The AQ offers a concise measure that assesses the accessibility of peer-reviewed research produced by an individual or group, by incorporating data on open availability to readers worldwide, the degree of financial barrier to access, and journal quality. The paper reports on the context for developing this measure, how the AQ is calculated, how it can be used in faculty outreach, and why it is a useful lens to use in assessing progress towards more open access to research. METHODS Journal articles published in 2009 and 2010 by faculty members from one department in each of MIT’s five schools were examined. The AQ was calculated using economist Ted Bergstrom’s Relative Price Index to assess affordability and quality, and data from SHERPA/RoMEO to assess the right to share the peer-reviewed version of an article. RESULTS The results show that 2009 and 2010 publications by the Media Lab and Physics have the potential to be more open than those of Sloan (Management), Mechanical Engineering, and Linguistics &amp;amp; Philosophy. DISCUSSION Appropriate interpretation and applications of the AQ are discussed and some limitations of the measure are examined, with suggestions for future studies which may improve the accuracy and relevance of the AQ. CONCLUSION The AQ offers a concise assessment of accessibility for authors, departments, disciplines, or universities who wish to characterize or understand the degree of access to their research output, capturing additional dimensions of accessibility that matter to faculty.

AB  - At the University of Eastern Finland (UEF) Library, the national Open Science and Research initiative (2014–2017, Ministry of Education and Culture of Finland) triggered the planning and construction of open science related research support services. Planning of support services with themes of open access scholarly publishing, open research data and open study material began at full throttle at the UEF Library in November 2015. Information specialists were grouped into teams, which orientated to separate aspects of open science and shared their knowledge by training the whole library staff. Teamwork continued actively over the year 2016. Open science continuously brings new tasks for the Library and has already notably changed the job profiles of the library specialists.Advancing open science has been considered highly important not only at the library but also at the university level. UEF has offered resources e.g. by recruiting new information specialists and a data protection officer and internal auditor. UEF Library has a vital role in conducting open science but it is practiced in close collaboration with University Services, especially that of Development Services, General Administration and Legal Services and IT Services. Open Science team has landed the departments to share information and to discuss about open science practices at UEF. Nowadays these roadshows concerning UEF publishing and data policy, open access (OA) publishing as well as research data management and sharing are our focal operation.Work continues but the results can already be seen: In the OA ranking of research organisations in Finland (Ministry of Education and Culture of Finland), UEF has achieved level four in the five-level maturity model. Also, UEF researchers can order tailored training sessions about open research and support services from the diverse training menu offered by the Library. Updated Open UEF web pages are available for everyone and multi-channeled informing directed to UEF staff and students continues online. One concrete output from conducted open science and active campaigning about self-archiving is UEF institutional publication repository, UEF//eRepository, which was launched in February 2017. At the moment about 31% of UEF scientific publications are open access, but substantial increase is expected. The next big challenge in open research is data management and opening. UEF Library is starting to build a metadata portal for research data in order to conceive the data produced by UEF researchers and to help finding data for potential reuse.Open science will also be included in information retrieval studies of master's degree and doctoral students. To encourage students and teachers in OA publishing, during the international open access week, one student publishing master's thesis openly will be rewarded with a stipend by the Library. Department having the highest rate of OA master's theses will also be adorned with flowers.Open science is a matter of teamwork, committing and keeping up to date.

AB  - This paper examines the differences between the publication performance (PP) of the scientific research areas (SRAs) of the hard and soft sciences. Intrigued by the significant statistical difference between the average publication levels of researchers from the hard and soft SRAs, this paper addresses the factors influencing researchers' publication levels. The study uses an online survey to gather data from 663 researchers from 140 research centers. A comparison of the parsimony solutions for the hard and soft sciences shows only two common pathways, thus providing evidence of different sufficient condition sets for publication for the two SRAs. The global intermediate solutions account for over 85% of the study's outcome variable, with consistency levels of more than 75%. The results show differences in the sufficient condition sets for the two SRAs that may be attributed to the variations in their scientific conceptual frameworks and the research methods applied by each discipline. Notably, having tenure seems to make a difference.

AB  - ORCID, the Open Researcher and Contributor ID, is a nonprofit, community-driven effort to create and maintain a registry of unique researcher identifiers and a transparent method of linking research activities and outputs to these identifiers.Together with other persistent identifiers for scholarly works such as digital object identifiers (DOIs) and identifiers for organizations, ORCID makes research more discoverable.It helps ensure that one's grants, publications and outputs are correctly attributed.It helps the research community not just in aggregating publications, but in every stage of research, viz.publishing, reviewing, profiling, metrics, accessing and archiving.Funding agencies in Austria, Australia, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden and the UK, and the world's leading scholarly publishers and associations have integrated their systems with ORCID registry.Among the BRICS countries, China and South Africa are adopting ORCID avidly.India is yet to make a beginning.If research councils and funding agencies in India require researchers to adopt ORCID and link ORCID iDs to funding as well as tracking performance, it will help them keep track of the workflow.Journal editors can also keep track of contributions made by different authors and work assigned to different reviewers through their ORCID iDs.Natl Med J India 2016;29:e1-e8 'needless ambiguity and confusion' caused by authors who omit parts of their names and initials in their published works, and recommended that 'scientists who are just now embarking on their careers would be well advised to measure the information content on their names as they appear in indexes such as Index Medicus, Physics Abstracts, Biological Abstracts and Science Citation Index.' 1 Some 12 years later, he wrote a detailed paper on the problems the scholarly world faces on account of mere names of people. 2 He had reasons to worry more than anyone else; as the publisher of Science Citation Index, Current Contents and several other search and indexing tools for the world's scientists and scholars, he had the unenviable task of processing millions of papers and author names not only in the byline of these papers but also in the references cited in them and rendering these author names accurately and attributing research papers to the right authors and institutions within a few weeks of publication.People hail from all parts of the world and from different cultures, each having its own peculiarities in naming their people so much so people from one culture may find names of another strange.Added to that are the ways names from different cultures and languages are transliterated into the Roman script.The names in most parts of the western world have three parts, viz. the first name (or given name), middle name and last name (also called the family name or surname).Often the last name may have more than one word, e.g.Duncan Smith, von Braun, van der Waals, de Solla Price.The prefix 'van' in some names may be spelt with a capital V, albeit rarely, e.g.Van de Graaff (of generator fame).In some cultures there are a very large number of people having the same surname.For example, close to 85% of China's population have one of only 129 surnames, and three names in particular, viz.Wang, Li and Chen, are predominant among authors publishing currently.Also there are two Chinese surnames that can be spelt as Wang when publishing in English language, says Jane Qiu. 3 Eight Chinese names transliterate in Roman script into Wei Wang and to avoid ambiguity in such cases journals may allow authors the option to include their names in their own language in parentheses after the transliterated name. 4Among Korean authors, Kim and Park account for a large percentage.In India there are many Agarwals, Guptas, Mukherjees, Raos, Sharmas and Singhs among publishing authors.While some Indians have two-part surnames, e.g.

AB  - Open Educational Resources (OER) are reducing barriers to education while allowing creators the opportunity to share their work with the world and continue owning copyright of their work. To support new authors and adaptors in the OER space, we provide an overview of common considerations that creators and adaptors of OER should make with respect to issues related to copyright in the context of OER. Further, and importantly, a challenge in the OER space is ensuring that original creators receive appropriate credit for their work, while also respecting the credit of those who have adapted work. Thus, in addition to providing important considerations when it comes to the creation of open access works, we propose shared norms for ensuring appropriate attribution and credit for creators and adaptors of OER.

AB  - Purpose As libraries become more involved in curating research data, reference librarians will need to be trained in conducting data interviews with researchers to better understand their data and associated needs. This article seeks to identify and provide definitions for the basic terms and concepts of data curation for librarians to properly frame and carry out a data interview using the Data Curation Profiles (DCP) Toolkit. Design/methodology/approach The DCP Toolkit is a semi‐structured interview designed to assist librarians in identifying the data curation needs of researchers. The components of the DCP Toolkit were analyzed to determine the base level of knowledge needed for librarians to conduct effective data interviews. Specific concepts, definitions, and examples were sought through a review of articles, case studies, practitioner resources and from the experiences of the Purdue University Libraries. Findings Data curation concepts and terminology are not yet well‐defined and often vary across, or even within fields of study. This research informed the development of a workshop to train librarians in using the DCP Toolkit. The definitions and concepts addressed in the workshop include: data, data set, data lifecycle, data curation, data sharing, and roles for reference librarians. Practical implications Conducting a data interview can be a daunting task given the complexity of data curation and the lack of shared definitions. Practical tools and training are needed to help librarians develop capacity in data curation. Originality/value This article provides practical information for public service librarians to help them conceptualize and conduct a data interview with researchers.

AB  - The advent of the Internet and the subsequent adoption of Open Access schemata are changing the nature of the scholarly discourse. In response, we seek to stimulate a debate about the role and desired forms of Open Access publishing in the context of the Information System (IS) discipline. We explore the potential contribution of an Open Access perspective on publishing IS-related research and also discuss the roles of traditional journals and their prospects in the contexts of our observations. In particular, we focus on the new possibilities of publishing work-in-progress and its potential benefit for knowledge dissemination including the prospects of turning today's limited scholarly exchange into mass collaboration. We illustrate our vision with a working prototype of an Open Access disciplinary repository entitled Sprouts (http://sprouts.aisnet.org). Our aim is to inspire new thinking about the role of Open Access publishing, the potential of its application to disciplinary repositories of emergent work, its anticipated repercussions on our work practices, and its long-term implication for the impact of IS scholarship and the well-being of our community at large. We call for participation and further action in realizing a global repository of IS research in progress. This paper builds on a panel on Open Access that was presented at the 2008 International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), held in Paris, France, in December 2008.

AB  - Purpose The paper seeks to propose that librarians act to ensure the continued existence of small, specialized, and non‐profit publishers as avenues of intellectual and academic discourse in an era of growing publishing monopolies. Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews the profitability of commercial publishers and their plans for expansion in the digital book market, and contrasts this with the continued financial hardships of public‐welfare academic publishers. Findings The problems for non‐profit academic publishers will not be solved by simply “going digital”. Practical implications Librarians need to exclude small academic publishers from further burdening through collective collection development. Originality/value The paper reviews developments in digital book publication from the perspective of a 1997 conference on the “crisis” in academic publishing with current business practices and expansions by large publishing houses.

AB  - Transparency, openness, and reproducibility are important characteristics in scientific publishing. Although many researchers embrace these characteristics, data sharing has yet to become common practice. Nevertheless, data sharing is becoming an increasingly important topic among societies, publishers, researchers, patient advocates, and funders, especially as it pertains to data from clinical trials. In response, ASTRO developed a data policy and guide to best practices for authors submitting to its journals. ASTRO's data sharing policy is that authors should indicate, in data availability statements, if the data are being shared and if so, how the data may be accessed.

AB  - After twenty years of the open access movement, there has been growth in the uptake of open access, and some progress has been made in achieving its original goals; however, results have been far from satisfactory, with more than half of the research literature still closed (COKI, 2022; Curry, 2018). Moreover, new concerns have arisen, such as questionable quality and the reliability of peer review, in particular predatory publishing. There are also threats to equity, including stratifications of publishing as a consequence of the exclusionary character of the author-pays model of open access, and new risks of bias and exclusion in the means of transparent evaluation (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2022). It is argued that these challenges are the result of the uncritical narratives of openness and their narrow focus on access alone which fail to address inequitable power dynamics, systemic problems and the structural barriers in scholarly publishing and knowledge production (Perry, 2020; ibid.).These cha(lle)nges in the system of scholarly communication, coupled with recent advances in technology and the tectonic transformations in the information environment, require new (pedagogical) approaches and foci that would enable researchers and students to understand and navigate such a complex environment; for this, a holistic and integrative approach to scholarly communication and information literacy is needed (ACRL, 2013; Špiranec, 2015).Scholarly communication, including open access, is impossible without information literacy (Hebrang Grgić, 2016). As they are both concerned with (access to) information, open access and in particular critical information literacy largely share the same goals, ethical dimensions and values of (social and epistemic) justice, equity and democratisation. Indeed, they have been considered instrumental to achieving these, and even proclaimed a panacea and deus ex machina for the current scientific, social and political challenges and crises (Hebrang Grgić, 2016; Kapitzke, 2003). However, literature on the intersections and interplay between open access and information literacy has been limited.This paper seeks to intertwine these two concepts more strongly, for mutual exchange and benefit, by analysing their convergent aspects as well as the role information literacy has in the context of the complexities of the scholarly communication system and in achieving open access. The paper builds on the few empirical studies of the intersections between the two concepts (e.g. Hebrang Grgić (2016) which confirms the importance of ‘open access literacy’), but goes beyond their functional approaches, advocating a more holistic and critical approach to open access to help reinvent it and make a more substantial progress in open access. It argues that the transformations in the information environment and the scholarly communication system require not only basic skills and competences at the core of information literacy but also specific skills of, for instance, managing scientific data and publishing in open access sources. More importantly, what is also required is critical consciousness of all the aspects of the research process including the context, power relationships, and the privileged positions in knowledge production, publishing and dissemination, and an ability to evaluate the quality and reliability of information.The paper proposes critical open access literacy as a pedagogical methodology and strategy to confront the challenges and enable a critical understanding of the contemporary information environment and scholarly communication. In line with the tenets of critical information literacy, critical open access literacy is directed at an analysis and critique of the economic, social, political, legal and technological conditions, aspects and implications of open access and the overall scholarly communication system, as well as the power dynamics, tensions and flaws within them. This will empower students and researchers to navigate this environment successfully and potentially become champions of its transformation to make it more meaningful, reliable, equitable and democratic.

AB  - This study explored use restrictions found in licensed scholarly resources from the fields of history/art history, engineering, and health sciences. The analysis developed a framework of use restrictions that distinguishes between soft restrictions—which discourage use—and hard restrictions—which strictly prevent use. Soft restrictions include: extent of use, obfuscation, omission, amalgamation, frustration, and warning. The study concludes that these soft restrictions are relatively common in licensed scholarly resources. Further, while hard restrictions are less common, they are not unknown. The study questions whether librarians should be doing more to challenge use restrictions.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report on the development of a flexible and robust academic library structure that meets the demands of an ever changing user community and remains relevant and fit for purpose in a technology-driven age. The new structure makes provision for the delivery of new and innovative services responding to the need for a paradigm shift in twenty-first century academic librarianship. The move away from subject librarianship, which has been the bastion of South African academic librarianship, is significant. Design/methodology/approach This paper used the exploratory method to gain new insights into library structures that have restructured for the twenty-first century. The exploratory study was used to gain new insights into functional librarianship. Despite the short comings of the exploratory method, the method was deemed most appropriate as UCT Libraries was not seeking definitive answers but a process that would provide opportunities to explore possibilities for subsequent processes. Findings The move from subject librarianship to functional librarianship has given the library the opportunity to restructure. The restructured library can now offer new and/or radically expanded services to meet the demands of a twenty-first century academic library. Practical implications The development of new and future roles and responsibilities commensurate with a robust and “future-driven” structure will consolidate the library’s role as a collaborator in the teaching and learning, and research agendas of a higher education institution. Originality/value This paper will be of interest and value to library managers and staff wanting to develop a library structure that responds positively to the redefinition of the professional roles and functions of the library and to strategically position the academic library for the future. It will also be of interest to library and information science academics who may want to re-examine their curricula for the incorporation of new trends.

AB  - Abstract Author self-archiving systems, emerging from successful experiments with preprint servers, have emerged in a variety of fields. The Open Archives initiative was organized to create a forum to solve interoperability issues between author self-archiving solutions, as a way to promote their global acceptance. The initiative seeks to develop a framework for a “universal e-print archive” that establishes interoperability standards supporting the search and retrieval of e-print papers from all disciplines. The Santa Fe conventions were developed to ensure these archives work together so that any paper in any of these archives can be found from anyone's desktop worldwide, as if it were all in one virtual public library.

AB  - Academic libraries around the world are cancelling big deal journal subscriptions at an increasing rate. This is primarily due to budgetary challenges, the unsustainable hyperinflationary pricing of these packages, and a need to move toward new open access models. It is a complex situation with many vested interests and stakeholders. Some libraries have been the target of angry backlash from faculty after such cancellations. The purpose of this qualitative study is to discover strategies for communicating to the campus community about collections cancellations so that they will better understand and support the library in making these difficult decisions.

AB  - Key points Open research infrastructure provides the building blocks of scientific progress, which must be available to everyone, with no barriers to access. Organizations enabling open research infrastructure must endorse these fundamental principles: equity, value, trust, interoperability, sustainability, and community governance. Finding ways to invite co‐creation and community participation engenders a strong sense of ‘buy‐in’ and is therefore essential to developing successful research infrastructure.

AB  - Open Access Anne Shelley (bio) and Rachel E. Scott (bio) A variety of Open Access (OA) initiatives and models have emerged since the movement gained momentum at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Defined by Peter Suber as "digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions," OA continues to evolve and grow in complexity.1 Suber's definition underlines the two primary facets of OA: it is gratis, or free to read, and libre, free of copyright restrictions. The gratis aspect of OA is more apparent than the libre, leading to some confusion and inconsistent use of the phrase. Occasionally OA is used to describe publicly or freely available content irrespective of copyright or licensing restrictions. In this essay, we offer foundational definitions and explore several themes related to OA resources, music scholarship, and music librarianship. open access music scholarship Open Access publishing is most commonly associated with scholarly journal articles. It has proliferated inconsistently throughout music scholarship, with some subdisciplines quickly embracing it and others holding fast to traditional publishing models. Although many music scholars positively perceive the opportunities OA holds to democratize reading, others have cast doubt on the extent to which OA models truly foster equitable and global dialogue.2 Open Access is attended by a variety of funding and publishing models that have implications for implementation and sustainability. Gold OA requires the payment of an article processing charge (APC) or other publication fee to the publisher. Under gold OA, the author retains copyright and can choose their licensing terms and the article is free to read with no embargo. Diamond OA, also referred to as platinum or non-commercial OA, similarly allows the author to retain copyright and provides gratis and embargo-free access to article. Instead of charging article authors, their institution, or funder an APC, however, diamond OA is funded at the journal level, most often by non-profit [End Page 241] organizations. Green OA allows the author to deposit a specified version of the article (whether pre-review, post-review, or the version of record) in specified repositories without payment but does not necessarily stipulate copyright or licensing terms. Green OA intersects with what has been called gray OA or academic social networks (e.g., ResearchGate and Academia.edu), somewhat hazy options by which scholarly content is often made available regardless of the publisher's terms.3 Music theory has led the way in adopting not only OA publishing, but also open peer-review and open data practices. The Society for Music Theory, for example, has three diamond OA publications—Music Theory Online, SMT-V, and SMT-POD—all of which are free to read and do not charge authors fees to publish. By espousing openness, music theory has demonstrated that prestigious publishing venues and OA need not be mutually exclusive. Most primary society journals and other esteemed publication venues in music, however, remain behind a paywall with limited OA options. Participants in a recent study identified musicology as the most conservative subfield within music and the one in which OA has made the least progress.4 The American Musicological Society publishes its flagship journal behind a paywall and makes its pedagogical and experimental journals available OA.5 The Society for Ethnomusicology paywalls their flagship journal Ethnomusicology through the Scholarly Publishing Collective. The society recently added the peer-reviewed, OA Journal of Audiovisual Ethnomusicology, which suggests a willingness to support open models outside of their flagship. Both societies' flagship journals allow for the Green OA deposit of a version of the article in an approved repository. Given the significant overlap with disciplines in the social and hard sciences, music cognition and music education journals frequently offer APC-based OA models. In music education, for example, there are several journals published by Sage and Taylor & Francis that are hybrid OA—a model in which the payment of an APC will make an individual article Gold OA. The National Association for Music Education's Society for Research in Music Education, for example, publishes The Journal of Research in Music Education with Sage behind a paywall, but accommodates both Gold and Green OA.

AB  - Rick Anderson discusses the pressures on the current models of scholarly communication, as well as some of the major changes in the information environment. He then asks whether journals truly matter in the current information environment, and indicates that journals still serve as important indicators for the credibility and reliability of the articles within. He concludes his presentation with several new models of scholarship now possible in the current information environment, and possible avenues for further exploration for serialists. Anderson's presentation was followed by a short question and answer period.

AB  - This paper takes an overview of the work of the Securing a Hybrid Environment for Research Preservation and Access (SHERPA) team and the SHERPA Partnership institutions in the area of developing, populating and maintaining institutional open access repositories. Crucial to this work has been the development of a mutually supporting and enabling Partnership community, something that has now been recognised as needed by institutions that lie outside it. To this end, SHERPA is involved in efforts to support the individuals and institutions across the United Kingdom and Europe who are engaging with the open access agenda on a practical level; through setting up community networks and disseminating experience. Key in the experience of the SHERPA Partnership has been the role of advocacy of open access and institutional repositories to the research community. Whilst this experience has been unique to each institution, there are many shared lessons and best practice that the Partnership has recently reflected on and that are articulated within this paper. Finally, brief coverage on some of the vital community tools developed and maintained by SHERPA, and reflections on the evolving direction of open access in the United Kingdom, are made.

AB  - Abstract We report the outcomes of BioMed Central’s public consultation on implementing open data-compliant licensing in peer-reviewed open access journals. Respondents (42) to the 2012 consultation were six to one in favor (29 in support; 5 against; 8 abstentions) of changing our authors’ default open access copyright license agreement, to introduce the Creative Commons CC0 public domain waiver for data published in BioMed Central’s journals. We summarize the different questions we received in response to the consultation and our responses to them – matters such as citation, plagiarism, patient privacy, and commercial use were raised. In light of the support for open data in our journals we outline our plans to implement, in September 2013, a combined Creative Commons Attribution license for published articles (papers) and Creative Commons CC0 waiver for published data.

This article discusses the outcomes of recent academic demand for its use as a publishing tool of university journals and conference proceedings. The Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice is provided as an example. Digital Commons includes the editorial management software, EdiKit, which assists in managing submissions, editorial functions, and peer review. Also considered are changes to scholarly communication patterns arising out of the new open access, electronic only, publication regimes.

AB  - In 2014, University of California, Davis University Library and the California Digital Library collaborated on an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant-funded project to explore costs associated with moving scholarly journal subscriptions in the U.S. market entirely to an Article Processing Charge business model, known also as "Gold Open Access." We contacted MacKenzie Smith, one of the principal investigators, in order to get her reflections on the process of gathering the data, and to discuss some implications of the findings. The interview suggests that the "Pay It Forward" model could be successful over time, following a necessarily complex transition period.

AB  - All information services, regardless of the format used to convey the information, can be divided into the two fundamental categories of delivery and mediation. Delivery is the less visible but no less critical service responsible for shifting the physical information package among different locations. Delivery will become an increasingly significant—but no less invisible—function after the arrival of routine electronic publishing. Acquisitions administrators—who, along with circulation, interlibrary loan, and preservation officers, have primary responsibility for delivery in the paper-based academic library of today—need to begin planning now to expand their knowledge and responsibilities to respond to the new requirements for information delivery in the rapidly approaching age of networked information. If they can achieve such objectives, acquisitions staff will play a key role in improving the future contributions of the library to the academy.

AB  - Mobile technologies have become increasingly important in the field of education, providing innovative ways to engage students and enrich their learning experiences. ChatGPT is an innovative tool that can be used in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) classes to engage students, enhance their knowledge and skills, and add variety and interest to the traditional process of learning engineering English, whether accessed through computers or mobile devices. In light of this, the study aims to investigate and compare the attitudes of technical university students and teachers towards using ChatGPT in English classes, as well as their perspectives on academic integrity issues and the strategies they employ when using ChatGPT. The study involved 22 teachers and 60 students from a Ukrainian university. Quantitative research, which involved collecting data through surveys, showed that students exhibited positive attitudes, while teachers took a more neutral approach. Both groups agree that ChatGPT plays a supplementary role in enhancing both hard and soft skills, as well as English language communication skills. However, they emphasized its impact on the development of research skills. The study highlights critical issues related to academic integrity, specifically the differing perceptions of possible violations between students and teachers. The authors present ideas on integrating ChatGPT into ESP classes, enabling teachers to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools for language learning and adapt to changing educational landscapes. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating ChatGPT effectively into engineering English classes to support students’ learning. While emphasizing the importance of guidelines for academic integrity, it also advocates for the creative use of AI tools by teachers and students. Addressing the disparity in attitudes suggests providing teacher professional development to ensure proficient use of AI tools.

AB  - The task of definition detection is important for scholarly papers, because papers often make use of technical terminology that may be unfamiliar to readers. Despite prior work on definition detection, current approaches are far from being accurate enough to use in realworld applications. In this paper, we first perform in-depth error analysis of the current best performing definition detection system and discover major causes of errors. Based on this analysis, we develop a new definition detection system, HEDDEx, that utilizes syntactic features, transformer encoders, and heuristic filters, and evaluate it on a standard sentence-level benchmark. Because current benchmarks evaluate randomly sampled sentences, we propose an alternative evaluation that assesses every sentence within a document. This allows for evaluating recall in addition to precision. HEDDEx outperforms the leading system on both the sentence-level and the document-level tasks, by 12.7 F1 points and 14.4 F1 points, respectively. We note that performance on the high-recall document-level task is much lower than in the standard evaluation approach, due to the necessity of incorporation of document structure as features. We discuss remaining challenges in document-level definition detection, ideas for improvements, and potential issues for the development of reading aid applications.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the important emerging trends in information technology and is slowly being implemented in libraries. The researchers have presented a brief strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of the application of AI in Pakistani university libraries. Design/methodology/approach This study uses an ethnographic approach for data retrieval. Five chief librarians were interviewed by phone, during which they were asked to identify one key strength, weakness, opportunity and threat in terms of introducing AI technologies. The researchers have used a standard SWOT matrix to report the respondents’ comments. Findings AI is already slowly being introduced into Pakistani university libraries. While commenting on ways in which AI could help their libraries deliver more innovative services and better meet user needs, respondents expressed concern about the investment required in funding, time and staff. Research limitations/implications Further study is indicated to identify existing AI implementations in Pakistani university libraries and to assess relevant library users’ perspectives. This study is limited to brief, qualitative data; its main purpose is to validate the use of a SWOT analysis. Practical implications Given that AI-based tools are already being used in libraries to some degree regardless of location, now is an opportune time to develop strategies for implementing AI technologies more widely. A SWOT analysis can be used to identify and categorize challenges and risks specific to AI in a logical way to support strategic decision-making. Originality/value To date, no SWOT analysis has been conducted in the context of AI applications in libraries, let alone specifically university libraries in Pakistan.

AB  - Funders increasingly mandate researchers to publish their scientific articles in open access and to retain their copyright. Universities all over the world have set up institutional repositories and use repositories for the preservation and dissemination of academic production of their institutions, including scientific articles, reports, datasets, and other research outputs. However, in general, authors do not find institutional repositories very attractive and accessible as an open access publication platform since repositories and open access are not part of the rewarding system. We expect that researchers are more likely to publish and deposit their scientific papers in a repository, once they have the appearance, recognition and dissemination of a scientific journal. That is why we took the initiative to set up a repository based journal 'University Journals' in which universities collaborate. The paper will explain the University Journals project and how the involved universities want to facilitate a valuable alternative publication platform that complies with Plan S principles and enables publication and dissemination of all research outcomes. By establishing University Journals as a publication platform, university libraries are instrumental (and crucial) in achieving the ambitions of Open Science, and universities gain control over the publication process.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the initial transformation of one academic library's digital media library into the institutional repository (IR) of its entire academic organization. Design/methodology/approach Provides a description of an academic digital library's evolution into an institutional repository, accompanied by both practical and philosophical analyses. Findings Materials supporting an academic institution's scholarship (from colleges and from supporting organizations on campus) can play an important part in the success of an institutional repository. Standards for metadata content, data structures and hierarchies of collections must be followed consistently, and adequate storage for digital media within an institutional repository is necessary to have in advance of anticipated demand for the smooth operation of the IR and continued access to materials. Gray areas between the role of an institutional repository and the role of that organization's archives need to be addressed in the future. Practical implications Academic libraries can be highly successful in producing an institute repository by developing relationships with various organizations on campus in addition to the academic programs. Maintaining standards throughout the IR is crucial to future growth in an organized and consistent manner. Philosophical considerations of the role of the IR should be addressed in the beginning stages of the development of the IR for eliminating confusion and duplication of its contents with other campus organizations. Originality/value This paper describes the development of a digital library, created and maintained by an academic library, and its gradual change into a de facto institutional repository. Other libraries in the planning stages or initial steps of creating a campus‐wide digital library or an institutional repository can benefit from the description of possible successes and problems that they could encounter during implementation.

AB  - With the emergence of advanced Internet technologies, access to scientific literature is evolving at an unprecedented pace. While the number of peer-reviewed publications is growing exponentially, unpublished technical reports, dissertations and other forms of grey literature are becoming increasingly accessible for researchers across the world. Research organizations and universities are capitalizing on this opportunity, actively making their research available on the Internet. At the National Research Council, the Institute for Research in Construction ensures that all fire-related literature produced is stored in an Institutional Repository and posted on the Web in a freely available manner. In doing so, this system has provided fire researchers with a vehicle to improve visibility of their research, having pronounced advantages. For the fire community, the material is an excellent source of scholarly articles, reports, technical data and conference papers. A close examination of the Institute’s fire-related literature in Google Scholar reveals citation patterns which illustrate the value of open-access, free literature to fire researchers.

AB  - A partnership forged between the George A. Smathers Libraries at the University of Florida and the Florida State Horticultural Society (FSHS) advances access to current and historical publications of the society and exemplifies an opportunity for agricultural librarians. The Public Knowledge Project's Open Journal System (OJS) was developed by librarians at Simon Fraser and Stanford universities to offer free, web-based publication software that promotes open access to journals and supports editorial workflow and publication needs. Collaborations among libraries and content creators that utilize open source tools like OJS are especially beneficial for agricultural organizations with limited financial and staffing resources. This paper examines the current state of library publishing partnerships with external organizations through analysis of survey data collected by the authors, and shares lessons learned from an example partnership. In this example librarians contributed their expertise in peer-review publishing, intellectual property rights, and institutional repositories to develop a customized online journal site using OJS for FSHS in a manner that reflects the publication workflow of the society. Customized features include branding, peer review, member subscription, full-text indexing, and access to archived issues. Trainings on OJS and digital publication service empower subject-area librarians to serve as points of contact for additional collaborations. Utilizing OJS in partnerships between libraries and content creators enhances the relevancy of the library and subject-area librarians while promoting greater access to agricultural information.

AB  - Libraries and university presses coexist in a complex and increasingly consolidated scholarly communication ecosystem. Each brings different strengths, values, and viewpoints that can inform and enrich a joint project. In this paper we discuss potential barriers to and benefits of collaboration between academic libraries and university presses and introduce a case study of such a collaboration: the Open Textbook Toolkit. This project, funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, is currently investigating the components needed to support faculty in one discipline, psychology, who are considering adopting open educational resources. By leveraging both library and press expertise, the Toolkit represents one model for fruitful collaboration.

AB  - The use and creation of Open Education Resources (OER) is becoming increasingly prevalent with teachers and learning designers at universities around the world. OER allows educators to create content and make their content available to the world under an open licence, and also provides the opportunity to use and adapt other OER content. Whilst the use and creation of OER in tertiary institutions is not yet considered the ‘norm’, many jurisdictions around the world have taken steps, to fund, support and encourage the use of OER in their educational institutions. The Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has developed an Open Education (OE) initiative to support the use and creation of OER at QUT. Policy is often the foundation stone, which supports progress and change. The underlying policy provides the framework and often points to the legal parameters that guide the objectives of the project or movement. The importance of policy is evident in the way in which QUT has developed and implemented an OE initiative to promote and support the creation and use of OER. This paper considers the history and development of OER, using QUT’s OE initiative as an example of the ways in which policy and implementation can lead to positive change.

AB  - ABSTRACT Specialists in serials have been dealing with the effects of an imbalance in the scholarly communication process for some time. The increase in scholarly output coupled with the decreasing ability of libraries to provide access to that output due to spiraling journal costs has created tensions for libraries and their communities. By advocating and providing a means to provide open access to scholarly output, institutional repositories have been promoted as one strategy for redefining the scholarly communication model. Since January 2003, the University of Oregon libraries have been exploring this approach. The article will discuss the challenges and opportunities that such repositories face and examine their effectiveness in changing the nature of scholarly communication. This will be done primarily through a case study of the experience of the University of Oregon Libraries.

AB  - Two different debates about electronic journals have been going on more or less independently, one assuming continuation of commercial publishing and the other advocating various free or inexpensive models. The provision of sophisticated facilities in commercial electronic journals is a major reason for the cost differences between the two models. Do users want these bells and whistles? Authors, not the readers or the buyers, are the key users of the scholarly literature, and authors want eyes, not pennies. If authors mount all their papers on their own web sites, commercial publication of specialised scholarly journals will be difficult to maintain.

AB  - The current ways in which documents are made freely accessible in the Web no longer adhere to the models established Budapest/Bethesda/Berlin (BBB) definitions of Open Access (OA). Since those definitions were established, OA-related terminology has expanded, trying to keep up with all the variants of OA publishing that are out there. However, the inconsistent and arbitrary terminology that is being used to refer to these variants are complicating communication about OA-related issues. This study intends to initiate a discussion on this issue, by proposing a conceptual model of OA. Our model features six different dimensions (prestige, user rights, stability, immediacy, peer-review, and cost). Each dimension allows for a range of different options. We believe that by combining the options in these six dimensions, we can arrive at all the current variants of OA, while avoiding ambiguous and/or arbitrary terminology. This model can be an useful tool for funders and policy makers who need to decide exactly which aspects of OA are necessary for each specific scenario.

AB  - This article examines how consortia can engage commercial publishers' hybrid open access (OA) publication programs. The article argues that it is appropriate and necessary for consortia to demonstrate leadership in influencing the information marketplace. Two models for negotiations are examined: 1) “market determinative” strategy, and 2) “consortium discount” strategy, comprised of three variations on existing consortia practices. An examination of the advantages and challenges indicates that the latter would have a greater chance for success. Keys to this conclusion include: establishing linkages between consortium licensing and hybrid titles, cost containment/alignment, and engaging publishers through an integrated model approach.

AB  - Academic interlibrary loan practitioners are experiencing changes that can be characterized as either the fragmentation of the resource sharing mission or its evolution into a new form of service routinely making use of new and diverse sources of information outside the scope of past practices. Among these new sources are curated repositories of open access literature, institutional repositories, digital libraries containing scanned public domain literature, and social media article-sharing networking sites. The incorporation of these sources of information into regular workflows presents interlibrary loan practitioners with many challenges. This paper will discuss ways to address these developments.

AB  - Key points The supply chain for monographs and related types of books is much more complex than that for journals. Sales per title are falling, while the efforts devoted to marketing individual titles have diminished too. Readers have a strong preference for physical print rather than e‐books, while libraries’ preference in purchasing is the other way round. Publishers, intermediaries, and libraries all face additional costs and complexity because they must continue to deal with both print and e‐books. Current inefficiencies in the supply chain act as a restraint on discoverability, demand, and access to academic books.

AB  - MODERATOR: Kelly Hadsell Federation of State Medical Boards SPEAKERS: Cary Moskovitz Duke University David Hansen Authors Alliance @DigLibCopyright REPORTER: Ruth Isaacson Genetics Society of America Text recycling has long been a source of confusion for researchers, editors, and publishers and is inappropriately regarded as a form of self-plagiarism. To provide clarity regarding text recycling and consensus about what is ethically and legally acceptable, the Text Recycling Research Project1 (TRRP), a multi-institution, NSF-funded initiative, investigates text recycling in STEM research. TRRP members Cary Moskovitz and David Hansen shared some of the TRRP findings and recommendations. TRRP’s definition of text recycling is as follows: Text Recycling is the reuse of textual material (prose, visuals, or equations) in a new document where (1) the material in the new document is identical to that of the source (or substantively equivalent in both form and content), (2) the material is not presented in the new document as a quotation (via quotation marks or block indentation), and (3) at least one author of the new document is also an author of the prior document.2 Moskovitz explained that in publishing, editors often ask authors to rework their materials in 1 of 3 ways to avoid ethical and legal concerns. While on the surface these appear to be reasonable approaches, Moskovitz detailed why text recycling is often more appropriate. Summarize and Cite Editors may ask authors to paraphrase and cite text when it is recycled from a large block of text. However, when documents are behind paywalls, […]

AB  - This paper describes our vision for the new UTS Library opening in 2016/17. Preparations are currently focussed on implementing enabling technologies which will move up to 80% of the print collection to an automated storage and retrieval system. This will allow the physical library to shift from a space dominated by book storage to a vibrant space for people, and facilitate better integration of physical and digital collections, services and spaces. While underpinned by technology, our new library is about people, and this paper describes the co-design practices we are exploring to include our clients in the planning process and ensure we deliver library services which meet their needs.

AB  - A significant new study has been conducted at Cornell University. The Mann Library surveyed several hundred titles in Agriculture and Biology, in order to analyse their prices (per page and per thousand characters) over time, comparing university presses, commercial publishers, society publishers and government agencies. They aimed to develop a methodology, using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, which could be used elsewhere, and to use their findings to examine the patterns of article ownership and pricing of published scientific research.

AB  - The stereotype of the reference transaction is more or less unchanged since Samuel Swett Green’s day, as involving precisely one librarian and one user. There are many common situations in which the reference transaction is not a one-to-one interaction, and this article will explore those situations. Additionally, this article argues that as network technology is increasingly utilized in reference work, situations in which the reference transaction is not a one-to-one interaction are becoming more common. Indeed, this article argues that as network technology is increasingly utilized in reference work, reference work will become fundamentally a collaborative effort, to the benefit of both individual reference services and reference work in general.

AB  - Victoria University of Wellington Library's support for research is at a crossroads. The university is implementing an ambitious research strategy. In response, the library is repositioning services and support based on the identified needs of our researchers and contextualized within the research lifecycle. This is paralleled by the changing expectations and responsibilities of library staff and the skills, knowledge and pan-university relationships that are needed to deliver these evolving services. In this case study the key priorities for the Library's service development and delivery are outlined along with plans for building the capability of subject librarians in key areas. It discusses the challenges that are being addressed and key initiatives undertaken in collaboration with other university colleagues. It outlines strengths that already exist within the library structure, identifies what new skills and competencies are required, and touches on future developments.

AB  - What serials should be cancelled and what is a systematic way to do it? The Usage/Cost Relational Index identifies low-use journals and ranks the titles in relation to their subscription cost. The Index has a simple formula easy for librarians to apply and explain to inquisitive faculty. The Index Numbers are calculated on a spreadsheet that can receive subscription and use statistics by importing electronic data files in ASCII format. The Index is individual for each library and flexible in the usage data needed for the study. Use statistics may include interlibrary loan activity, exclude in-house use or have other data quirks. It is important for the manager to be aware of what the usage figures represent. Use studies can be timeconsuming and, therefore, expensive, but their costs can be recovered in the cancellation process.

AB  - One year of russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine to seize its territory and destroy the Ukrainian people as a nation, its language, culture, scientific achievements, and educational traditions have demonstrated the incredible adaptability of universities and their libraries. This paper aims to analyze the administrative aspect of the urgent adaptation of library teams of Ukrainian higher education institutions to martial law conditions in the example of the Scientific Library of the Ukrainian State University of Science and Technologies (USUST). The paper considers the experience of survival, resilience, and adaptation of the USUST library to the war, which can be extrapolated to other libraries of Ukrainian higher education institutions. In addition, the study comparatively analyzes quantitative indicators of five university libraries as of January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023. The main vectors of library activity are distance, openness, unification, and improvement of the single information space. The primary motivating factors for librarians’ resilience and adaptation to wartime working conditions are belief in the Armed Forces and the victory of Ukraine. The study emphasizes the importance of university libraries’ support of open educational resources as one of the methods of overcoming the Ukrainian linguocide. Library directors in wartime, with predominantly female staff, note the impact of psychological factors on their professional activities. Despite the threatening trends, libraries continue to support educational and scientific processes in their universities, launching new directions of activity.

AB  - Abstract Open scholarship is a major reform movement within research. This paper seeks to understand how open scholarship might address the challenges faced by research in Africa, through a study based on a participatory collaborative workshop to create a partnership with librarians in Rwanda. The literature review identifies three broad perspectives on the apparent under-performance of Rwandan research: one locating the issue in the unequal scholarly communications system, a second pointing to a country deficit and a third blaming cognitive injustices. The Rwandan librarians see researchers as challenged through the pressures on them to publish, the costs of research, poor infrastructure, lack of skills and limited access to literature. Collectively these challenges constitute a critical barrier to research. These limits fit largely the country deficit perspective. Open scholarship as conceived in the Global North is only a small part of the answer to the challenges faced by Rwandan scholars. To promote equity, notions of open scholarship need to take into account the conditions under which research is conducted in less privileged contexts such as Rwanda.

AB  - Researcher-facing librarians in New Zealand are providing guidance across more of the research lifecycle than ever before in response to an increasingly complex scholarly ecosystem. This research explored the development of research support through survey responses from all eight New Zealand University Libraries. From the responses it was possible to ascertain the level of services offered or planned in the four key areas of research impact, Research Data Management, scholarly communication and Kaupapa Māori research. Skills gaps and barriers to service development were also identified. Comparison with an earlier study revealed that research impact and Research Data Management services have developed well over the last 6 years. A good level of maturity was identified in scholarly communication services but support for Kaupapa Māori research was identified as an area for development. Barriers to service development included lack of resourcing and low recognition of library value from the wider institution.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine how libraries can create relative bargaining power and presents a methodology for analyzing collections and preparing for negotiations. Design/methodology/approach A brief literature review of the current state of collection budgets and electronic resource prices is presented prior to proposing a methodology based on business analysis frameworks and techniques. Findings Electronic resource subscription prices are increasing at a rate significantly higher than inflation, while collection budgets grow slowly, remain stagnant or decrease. Academic libraries have the ability to counteract this trend by creating relative bargaining power through organizational efforts that take advantage of size and concentration (e.g. consortia), vertical integration through practices such as library publishing and open access and through individual efforts using information. This paper proposes metrics and methodologies that librarians can use to analyze their collections, set negotiation priorities and prepare for individual resource negotiations to create relative bargaining power. Practical implications The proposed methodology enables librarians and buyers of information resources to harness the information available about their electronic resource collections to better position themselves when entering negotiations with vendors. Originality/value This paper presents metrics, some not commonly used (i.e. average annual price increase/decrease), that aid in understanding price sensitivity. Pareto analysis has been traditionally used to analyze usage, but this paper suggests using it in relation to costs and budgets for setting negotiation priorities.

AB  - The explosion in smart mobile devices is increasing demand for mobileenabled content and services. The growth in this market has provided opportunities for scholarly publishers to deliver targeted and relevant mobile content and information to their customers. Most innovative publishers have started to experiment with mobile strategies, and have developed applications for iPhone, Android and BlackBerry. However, since these devices are based on different technology platforms, development for multiple devices inevitably means significant duplicated effort as application code cannot be shared between them. HTML5 provides publishers with a new set of powerful technologies to mitigate this problem. By using HTML5 and web services, publishers can cut out wasted effort and build cross-platform apps which work on all current mobile devices.This paper explores the options in more detail, and shows how publishers can reduce development costs, improve time to market and deliver more futureproof mobile applications.

AB  - This paper reports on the results of a 2007 survey of Australian academic libraries and their practice with regard to the storage and disposal of legacy print material. The survey was undertaken in the wake of similar surveys in the United States and the United Kingdom, and with a view to assess the likely future demand for storage space. The discussion focuses on the advantages of a national print repository based on ceded ownership.

AB  - Libraries continue to spearhead initiatives to incentivize instructors to adopt, adapt, and create open educational resources (OER). However, these programs often do not explicitly require educators to preserve the OER they create. Drawing on an analysis of semi-structured interviews with six experts, this article presents considerations for libraries interested in preserving OER and recommendations for OER librarians who are new to digital preservation. The study makes an argument for why and how libraries could begin to preserve OER. Future areas of investigation include better understanding how OER repositories preserve such resources and how consortia models can support this work.

AB  - Understanding Knowledge as a Commons: From Theory to Practice edited by Charlotte Hess and Elinor Ostrom. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2007. 320 pp. ISBN 0-262-08357-4. In Binta y la Gran Idea (Manso, 2004), a warmhearted short film nominated at the 79th Academy Awards, the main character, Agnile, a local fisherman from a small village in Senegal, learns from a friend that most modern fishing equipment used in Europe allows you to catch in one day, more fish than you could eat in your whole life. Puzzled by this finding, Agnile humbly writes to the local government: “if we follow the path shown to us by the First World, we risk that the children of our children will have no fish, no trees, no air...” The preoccupation of Agnile - the dissipation of a common good due to its over- exploitation by groups and individuals pursuing their best interest - is the tragedy of the commons. This theory, memorably depicted by Garrett Hardin (Hardin, 1968), is the thread that conceptually ties together the chapters of Understanding knowledge as a commons: From theory to practice, a collection of essays edited by Charlotte Hess and Elinor Ostrom. Contributors to this book include leading scholars in domains such as intellectual property, open source software, electronic publishing, digital preservation and civic engagement. Their essays present an analysis of the knowledge commons from their particular perspectives and in relation to Hardin's tragedy. The book is divided into three sections: the study of the knowledge commons, their protection, and their production. What are knowledge commons? In the first section of the book, Hess and Ostrom provide a very thorough introduction and analysis of the concept of knowledge as a commons, appropriate for readers of all levels of familiarity with this field. Remarkably, they collocate the notion of knowledge in the context of more tangible realms, such as oceans and forests, which have traditionally been regarded as common-pool resources. Their analysis, however, tends to capture communities and their knowledge generation mechanisms in too great detail - something that risks undermining the very open-ended nature of the knowledge commons. For example, their diagnostic study tool (the Institutional Analysis and Development framework) primarily takes into account traditional scholarly communication channels, not leaving enough space for novel forms of collaborative knowledge generation and dissemination. However, with David Bollier's contribution (The Growth of the Commons Paradigm), the concept of knowledge commons is reformulated, in particular with respect to its most recent evolution. Bollier does a thorough job of presenting a new cultural form of

AB  - To support migration from print to electronic resources, the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library at Yale University reorganized its Technical Services Department to focus on managing electronic resources.The library hired consultants to help plan the changes and to present recommendations for integrating electronic resource management into every position. The library task force decided to focus initial efforts on the periodical collection. To free staff time to devote to electronic journals, most of the print subscriptions were switched to online only and new workflows were developed for e-journals.Staff learned new responsibilities such as activating e-journals, maintaining accurate holdings information in the online public access catalog and e-journals database ("electronic shelf reading"), updating the link resolver knowledgebase, and troubleshooting. All of the serials team members now spend significant amounts of time managing e-journals.The serials staff now spends its time managing the materials most important to the library's clientele (e-journals and databases). The team's proactive approach to maintenance work and rapid response to reported problems should improve patrons' experiences using e-journals. The library is taking advantage of new technologies such as an electronic resource management system, and library workflows and procedures will continue to evolve as technology changes.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to trace the recent history of Australian attempts to reach a national solution to the space problems that afflict many of our research libraries. Design/methodology/approach In recent years there has been a growing international interest in the development of shared facilities to house legacy print collections as a means of providing cost‐effective and secure storage. These “repositories” have in some cases been successfully implemented on a national scale. This paper argues that although negotiations have not been successful to date, the opportunity still exists to re‐open discussions, and makes suggestions regarding the organisational structures that are needed to bring about a successful outcome. Findings Initiatives such as Libraries Australia have been made possible by coordinated cross‐sectoral activity, undertaken in the service of Australian research communities. What has not been as successful is the use of this infrastructure to underpin further collaboration with regard to the long‐term development and maintenance of collections. The prospect of a national repository provides a further opportunity to achieve such an outcome. Originality/value There are many reasons to believe that Australia research libraries and communities would benefit substantially from a national print repository. It will only be possible, however, with the right structure for leadership, coordination and advocacy. There is much that can be learnt from the UK experience in this regard, and Australia library leaders should look to building a strong base of cross‐sectoral support for a renewed bid.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report the outcomes of a Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)‐sponsored study to determine the current state and trends in different forms of scholarly output used in teaching and research; and the nature and extent of problems associated with their use. Design/methodology/approach A total of 60 UK HE institutions were chosen at random and a selection of departments within these was contacted. An online questionnaire was distributed to the selected departments; resulting in responses from 304 academics across a broad range of subjects and institution types. Findings The study showed that printed output was still the preferred option in both teaching and research, although electronic journals now have a well‐established presence. Web‐based material is increasingly provided in teaching and used in research but this includes primarily traditional tools such as reading lists and links to scholarly resources. Some content creation was evident. Use of web 2.0 was not extensive, although respondents were making use of Institutional Learning Environments. Academics were aware of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues but not always clear about their responsibilities in this area. Research limitations/implications The study revealed an essentially conservative approach to the developments in digital information. This may have been due to the sample size which was relatively small, and the age profile which clustered around the 45‐65 years range. In the case of research the influence of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) was clear. Originality/value No equivalent study has been reported on the transition between traditional and new forms of scholarly output used in teaching and research. In this fast developing area this research provides a benchmark for future studies.

AB  - In 2018, RMIT University Library was awarded $5,000 fellowship from Libraries of the Australasian Network (LATN) to investigate opportunities in open educational resources (OER). The reasons behind the application were to advocate and increase the use of OER, increase knowledge and expertise in open licencing, and leverage support, advice and appropriate infrastructure from LATN members. The associated benefits to LATN would include the establishment of an OER community of practice and the development of shared tools and resources to facilitate the uptake of open educational resources at home institutions. This is the story of how the Open Textbook Initiative evolved and how a deliberate campaign to increase awareness and adoption of OER was created. Activities included delivering OER awareness sessions, aligning OER textbooks with selected subject areas, delivering an open textbook forum, with local and international speakers, and creating a savings bank for self-reported OER adoptions. The OER textbook hero program was developed to highlight the teaching challenges faced by academic staff and explore their responses. As a result of this activity, there has been greater visibility of OER and the discussion has evolved from textbook affordability to open educational practices.

AB  - The impact openness to knowledge is having, not only in the Higher Education (HE) sector but at the public and institutional policy level, is largely due to the efforts of information professionals and researchers, and thanks to these two groups, initiatives such as open access (OA), open education (OE), and open science (OSC) have changed the way in which research is being taught, conducted, and communicated. Openness is a way to democratise access to knowledge developed through public funds, and this movement has been led by informational professionals worldwide; however, we have observed that to a large extent, professional development in different areas of openness is rather self-taught, informal, mentored, or continuous, but not formalised in information science, documentation, or scientific educational programmes. In this exploratory research, we gathered evidence on how (or if) openness to knowledge is being taught by reviewing a series of syllabi from undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Library and Information Science (LIS) schools sampled from universities that either (a) are leading the agenda in OA, OSC, or OE; or (b) have policies in OA, OSC, or OE; or (c) have national/federal mandates, policies, or regulations regarding OA, OSC, or OE and also from a range of non-formal and/or lifelong learning training programmes offered in these same three areas. We found that while LIS schools are not providing formal training to gain skills and competencies in openness, their libraries are offering different kinds of training in this respect. On the other hand, the good intentions and openness awareness of policies have not yet materialised in actions to ensure capacity building. Research implications aim to influence the development of capacity building in open knowledge, by providing solid evidence for enhancing curriculum advancement in LIS schools and by proposing some recommendations in this direction.

AB  - The Center for Undergraduate Research (CURS) at Augusta University supports faculty-led undergraduate research. In collaboration with a student organization, the Program Coordinator of CURS contacted the Augusta University Libraries to investigate how to start an undergraduate research journal and identify a hosting venue. Two librarians provided guidance on the creation of a new Open Access journal using resources already provided by the university. This article discusses establishing the journal’s identity, developing policies and processes, hosting and publishing the journal, as well as challenges faced throughout the process.

AB  - At Leiden University, it is increasingly recognised that effective data management forms an integral component of responsible research. To actively promote the stewardship of all the research data that are produced at Leiden University, a comprehensive, institution-wide programme was launched in 2015, which centrally aims to encourage its researchers to carefully plan the temporal storage, long-term preservation and potential reuse of their data. This programme, which is managed centrally by the Department of Academic Affairs, and which receives important contributions from academic staff, from Leiden University Libraries, and from the University's central ICT organisation, basically consists of three parts. Firstly, a basic central policy has been formulated, containing clear guidelines for activities before, during and after research projects. The central aim of this institutional policy is to ensure that all Leiden-based research projects can effectively comply with the most common requirements stipulated by funding agencies, academic publishers, the Dutch standard evaluation protocol and the European data protection directive. As a second part of the data management programme, faculties have organised workshops and meetings, concentrating on the rationale and on the technical and organisational practicalities of effective data management in order to bring about a discipline-specific protocol. Data librarians employed by Leiden University Libraries have developed educational materials and provide training for PhDs in the principles and benefits of good data management. Thirdly, to ensure that scholars can genuinely make a reasoned selection among the many tools that are currently available, a central catalogue was developed which lists and characterises the most relevant data management services. The catalogue currently provides information about, amongst many other aspects, the organisations behind these services, the main academic disciplines which are targeted and the accepted file formats and metadata formats. The various aspects of these facilities have been classified using terminology provided by conceptual models developed by the UKDA, ANDS and the DCC. Using Leiden University's policy guidelines as criteria, the overall suitability of each service has also been evaluated. Leiden University's data management programme has a total duration of three years, and its basic objective is to offer a comprehensive form of support, in which the data management policy which is propagated centrally is complemented by various forms of assistance which ought to make it easier for scholars to adhere to this policy. The catalogue of data management services also aims to bolster the implementation of an adequate technical infrastructure, as the qualitative evaluations of the services enable policy-makers and developers to quickly establish gaps or other shortcomings within existing facilities.

AB  - Persistent identifiers (PID) to identify digital representations of physical specimens in natural science collections (i.e., digital specimens) unambiguously and uniquely on the Internet are one of the mechanisms for digitally transforming collections-based science. Digital Specimen PIDs contribute to building and maintaining long-term community trust in the accuracy and authenticity of the scientific data to be managed and presented by the Distributed System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo) research infrastructure planned in Europe to commence implementation in 2024. Not only are such PIDs valid over the very long timescales common in the heritage sector but they can also transcend changes in underlying technologies of their implementation. They are part of the mechanism for widening access to natural science collections. DiSSCo technical experts previously selected the Handle System as the choice to meet core PID requirements. Using a two-step approach, this options appraisal captures, characterises and analyses different alternative Handle-based PID schemes and the possible operational modes of use. In a first step a weighting and ranking the options has been applied followed by a structured qualitative assessment of social and technical compliance across several assessment dimensions: levels of scalability, community trust, persistence, governance, appropriateness of the scheme and suitability for future global adoption. The results are discussed in relation to branding, community perceptions and global context to determine a preferred PID scheme for DiSSCo that also has potential for adoption and acceptance globally. DiSSCo will adopt a ‘driven-by DOI’ persistent identifier (PID) scheme customised with natural sciences community characteristics. Establishing a new Registration Agency in collaboration with the International DOI Foundation is a practical way forward to support the FAIR (findable, accessible interoperable, reusable) data architecture of DiSSCo research infrastructure. This approach is compatible with the policies of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and is aligned to existing practices across the global community of natural science collections.

AB  - It is important to put scholarly communication in context by addressing the very broad idea of why scholarly communication is important.One of the main missions of universities is to create new knowledge and innovations-i.e., research.This new knowledge needs to be disseminated-to be exchanged such that the scholars creating the new knowledge are in touch with others, all contributing to the original ideas and new insights of each other.But scholarly communication is not just about people working at the same time on problems that are somehow connected; it is also about archiving research results for investigators of the future.In addition, it is critical that higher education is very much about educating students to be creative and innovative and, in this sense, access to research results and processes is critical for effective education.In short, scholarly communication is critical for both the research and educational missions of universities.

AB  - It has been said that the work of publishers and librarians will merge over time until we are all publarians and lublishers. Do we still envision a shared future? As new publishing programs within libraries and experimental publisher-library collaborations continue to challenge us to move outside of our comfort zones, are we learning from each other? What are some practical, down-to-earth ways that we can take advantage of each other’s expertise? How can we produce and market scholarly content in a more integrated way to meet the needs of scholars in a digital-information ecosystem, without duplicating effort on separate tracks? How might we address sustainability through combined, hybrid business models? In this session, some experienced experimenters and role benders in the world of the humanities will share lessons learned and attempt to chart a way forward to a shared future.

AB  - This article considers the case study of university libraries in the United Kingdom, and their exposure to the effects of the worldwide recession. Exchange rate changes have been a noteworthy aspect of the U.K. situation, with the pound sterling deteriorating markedly against both the Euro and the U.S. Dollar. Examples of the impact of these changes are outlined. The implications of government spending plans over the next few years are also examined. Some possible ways of coping with these changes are explored, including the expansion of shared services, a reduction in the prevalence of publisher bundle subscriptions, and an increase in the impact of open access activity.

AB  - This article provides a detailed analysis of the current state, needs, and desires of members of the TEI community working with manuscript material, based on the results of a survey carried out by the authors. An analysis of the survey results provides insights into the practices, problems, and limitations of the community utilizing the TEI for manuscript encoding. The results demonstrate the existence of a steep learning curve for the TEI, where many practitioners are self-taught and where learning-by-doing dominates; there exists a long gap between the first encounter with the TEI and its actual use in projects. Survey results highlight the need for user-friendly, bespoke tools facilitating the processing, analysis, and publishing of TEI-encoded texts. Feedback on the Guidelines themselves reveals aspects that do not fully meet the needs of those encoding manuscript material. To better address these needs, a strengthening of the Special Interest Groups is proposed.

AB  - Objective. The study aims to analyse the experience of university libraries in different countries in working with the Open Textbook (OT) and to consider the prospects of creating a similar pilot project in Ukraine. Methods. The analysis covered the world publications (journals, books, conference proceedings, posts on social networks) in the field of Library and Information Science, devoted to the role of libraries in OT support, that have appeared since 2014. The author studied the aspects revealing that publication, namely OT, support services are areas with great potential for the future development of academic / university libraries. Results. Numerous evidence is presented that the topic of library as a publisher in OT support is most developed in the universities and colleges in economically developed countries, especially in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain. Library strategies for OT projects have been identified. The author clarified the nature of the initiatives and partnerships of libraries in supporting OT, as well as the basic services and roles of libraries in these projects. Conclusions. Today, the global practice of Scholarly Communication has enough evidence that the functions of the Library, lost in the course of evolution, as a Knowledge Publisher have returned under its “roof” and supplemented the existing function of Knowledge Managers. Digital Library Publishing (DLP) services in OT support help to change the learning environment and life of students (including persons with disabilities), pedagogical practices of teachers by means of free textbooks with an open license, as well as to receive reputation benefits for the university, improving the image of the latter. The possibility of eliminating systemic inequalities in access to academic resources increases the significance and changes the role of libraries in open education. The successes of Ukrainian librarians in supporting digital scholarly communication initiatives and the successful implementation of Open Access support projects (repositories, e-journals, e-conferences) give confidence that they can act as initiators and key partners in creating affordable textbooks.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the history of KU ScholarWorks, the University of Kansas' institutional repository, and the various strategies used to promote and populate it. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes how KU ScholarWorks came into being, and discusses the variety of activities employed to publicize the repository and encourage faculty to deposit their work. In addition, the paper discusses some of the concerns expressed by faculty members, and some of the obstacles encountered in getting them to use the repository. The paper concludes with some observations about KU's efforts, an assessment of the success of the program to date, and suggests some next steps the program may take. Findings The paper found that KU ScholarWorks has relied on a “self‐archiving” model, which requires regular communication with faculty and long‐term community building. Repository content continues to grow at a steady pace, but uptake among faculty has been slow. In the absence of mandates requiring faculty to deposit work, organizations running institutional repositories must continue to aggressively pursue a variety of strategies to promote repositories to faculty and encourage them to deposit their scholarship. Originality/value KU's experience will help other institutions develop institutional repositories by providing examples of marketing strategies, and by promoting a greater understanding of faculty behavior and concerns with regard to institutional repositories.

AB  - Looking backward – Striding forward 2018 marks the 30th birthday of Learned Publishing and has made us consider what role the journal has played, continues to play, and should play in the evolving world of scholarly publishing. Our world has changed (almost) out of all recognition in the past three decades. This is largely due to developments in technology, which have shaped and influenced the changing expectations of what should be the norm for scholarly research publishing. We believe that the role of Learned Publishing within this environment is to provide evidence that helps everyone involved with scholarly publishing to make better decisions. Alongside facts and figures we have also published informed opinions from thought-leaders that discuss ‘hot topics’ and it is interesting to track the ebb and flow of themes over the past three decades. What is particularly striking is the move away from acceptance and defence of the traditional model that the journal published 30 years ago to more recent articles that (directly or indirectly) challenge the assumptions on which the current journal publishing environment is based. It is a terrible cliché to say that we have reached a crossroads, but perhaps it is correct to say that the watershed moment is imminent. Large and small influential changes seem to be introduced daily: from the launch of large funder publishing platforms (e.g. Wellcome Open), to evolving funder mandates (e.g. the UK Research and Innovation's OA monograph requirement in the Research Excellent Framework), to new quality metrics (e.g. Dimensions) and new journals offering innovative editorial and publishing methods (too many to mention). There are also an increasing number of advocacy events (e.g. OA week) to raise awareness of open science and challenge acceptance of the traditional publishing model. In such an uncertain environment, it becomes more important for society and other publishers to question the current models when deciding how to move forward – whilst also continuing to publish and remain financially secure. Although to some it may appear that publishers are going about business as usual with scant regard for the raging debates, our articles have demonstrated a wealth of developments and broad thinking about the issues at hand. This is a topic that receives regular attention in the journal (e.g. Morris, 2009) although mostly without resolution. Whilst some modifications to the journal model have been made (e.g. PLOS One, F1000Research, Frontiers journals), the basic model remains persistent. Perhaps the reason for this is that the model continues to fulfil the needs of academia (Nicholas et al., 2017). For tenure, promotion, and job security researchers are still required to publish, and to publish in ‘quality’ journals. The definition of quality is frequently restricted to ‘high impact factor’ (IF) and no matter how many debates there are about the limitations of the IF, and the alternative metrics on offer, it is to the IF that researchers around the world turn (Bodaghi, Sanni, & Zainab, 2015; O'Neill, 2000). This presents challenges for researchers and publishers alike – how can new models be developed and supported when researchers (especially early career researchers, and those in emerging economies) still need to publish in the established, traditional, journals? Allied with the question of the model is the question of how – and why – different journals add value to research, and how they, in their turn, can be valued. Pricing and value were hot topics in the 1990s and early 2000s (Cox, 2002; Singleton, 1994), and although there are few recent articles that directly talk about pricing, there are many articles that discuss the value-added services that publishers add (see, e.g. the January 2017 issue on discoverability, and Nicholas et al., 2017). One of the value-added services, managing the peer review services (which, of course, rely on the good will of researchers and academics), is a perennial topic, with over 50 articles published in the journal asking how we can improve the reviewing process and provide proper reward and recognition (e.g. Nicholson et al., 2015; Warne, 2016). Bibliometrics are frequently used to judge the value of a journal and we have seen a growth of bibliometric articles in the past few years. These range from evaluating specific indexes (e.g. the ESCI, Somoza-Fernández, Rodríguez-Gairín, & Urbano, 2018) to the effects of publishing a single high-impact article (Liu, Liu, Zuo, & Zhu, 2018) and present many other analyses used to determine impact. One question that has been discussed frequently in the past decade is what role societies, universities, and libraries should play in the publishing environment. As expected there are many articles asking what value journals bring to societies, both financial and reputational. There are frequently tensions between the mandate of a learned society to promote their discipline and the need for income to support its activities, and articles covering this topic appear throughout the journal's history (from Shelock, 1990, to Johnson & Fosci, 2015). Library publishing has emerged as a key topic more recently, although library-based initiatives (MUSE, Highwire, etc.) were discussed back in 1999 (Treloar, 1999). More recent articles have tracked new library and university-based presses (often closely allied with the institutional library, see Glahn, 2015), in particular the growth of these within the UK (see Lockett & Speicher, 2016, and the 2016 special issue on university presses, and the special Redux issue due for publication this year, 2018). One more recent topic that has emerged is the question of diversity and inclusion. This includes issues such as gender diversity (see Kane & Meadows, 2016), geographical inclusion, and accessibility for visually impaired. Publishers seem increasingly aware that we need to ensure that our practices are inclusive, not exclusive, and several recent articles reflect concerns and present experiences to suggest how discrepancies can be addressed. In common with many western publishers, we have seen an increase in the number of original research articles from outside the US/UK/western regions, and these have provided us with some unexpected perspectives – for example, why authors from some regions do not choose western journals for their work (Kurt, 2018). Regional diversity can be a challenge for editors and publishers alike when it comes to balancing perspectives, quality, and workload throughout the editorial processes (Gaston & Smart, 2018). Many journals have been experiencing a tremendous growth of articles from China (indeed, according to the recent National Science Foundation (NSF) statistics, China-based authors are now publishing more than US-based authors: NSF, 2018). Likewise, we have also received and published many more articles from this country in the past decade. Our articles reveal a wealth of research about Chinese research and publishing (e.g. Stanley & Shuai, 2007; Wang, Deng, You, Zhang, & Chen, 2017) and about international publishing partnerships (e.g. Lin & Zhan, 2016). Although regional diversity is often a challenge for publishers, it can also be an opportunity and our articles provide insights into the publishing and research environments in a wide range of countries. A more recent concern to add to these issues is the question of how well we make published content available to all, regardless of (dis)ability. To raise awareness of these challenges, the January 2018 issue was themed on accessibility, and the article from Bill Kasdorf (2018) neatly summarizes the problems and opportunities for publishers in ensuring fully compliant accessible material. When the journal first launched there was a regular column about copyright, and it remained a hot topic throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s (see the article from Sandy Thatcher in 1995 and compare to the more recent Dodds, 2018). However in the past 5 years, the conversation has changed. Although there are still discussions about fair use (or fair dealing) and changes to copyright exceptions, most articles now focus on unauthorized scholarly reuse of published articles (e.g. Tenopir et al., 2017) and fraudulent publishers (e.g. Martin & Martin, 2016). ResearchGate has come under some scrutiny in the journal – showing how ubiquitous it is to scholars’ lives (e.g. Borrego, 2017), and how misunderstood it is by the same scholars (e.g. Nicholas, Clark, & Herman, 2016). We have also published many articles on predatory publishing that range from accusing the gold OA model for encouraging fraudulent publishing (Beall, 2013), to criticizing the polarity of judging journals to be either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ (Eriksson & Helgesson, 2017; Smart, 2017), to asking why authors choose to publish in them (Kurt, 2018). One area of constant debate is, of course, open or closed access. We have published many, many articles on this topic (75 with ‘OA’ in their titles) including research and case studies reporting on different journal models (e.g. Wakeling et al., 2017), establishing or flipping OA journals (e.g. Laakso, Solomon, & Björk, 2016; Sondervan & Stigter, 2017), repositories (e.g. Borrego, 2017; Brand, 2012), financing (Lara, 2015), policies (e.g. Anderson, 2016; Armbruster, 2011), as well as articles presenting arguments for and against OA (e.g. Cooney-McQuat, Busch, & Kahn, 2010). Whilst the principle of OA publishing is now well established, the debate over financing continues – and provocative articles continue to raise debate and discussion (e.g. Green, 2017). Looking back over the content published in the past 30 years, it has been fascinating to track the progress of the journal from what was essentially a newsletter to becoming a combined research and opinion journal. It has also been illuminating to see the variety of opinions and research presented and has revealed some topics of transitory importance, and some that are fundamental to the development of scholarly communication and the role of publishers. Striding into the future, we aim to continue evolving – referring to the evidence that we publish to help inform our own decisions. With this in mind, we are expanding our editorial board by taking on more international editors, a student editor, and our first statistical editor. We have agreed to retain the thematic January issue as a way to capture ‘hot topics’, and hope to use the new journal platform to create thematic collections. We continue to receive articles with original research, and informed comment that discuss the future of publishing: and we hope to keep raising questions for further research. We encourage anyone in our industry to think beyond ‘White Papers’ and internal reports and consider publishing with the journal as a way of registering and recording their research for future analysis. We look forward to the next 30 years.

AB  - The full release and circulation of excavation results often takes decades, thus slowing down progress in archaeology to a degree not in keeping with other scientific fields. The nonconformity of released data for digital processing also requires vast and costly data input and adaptation. Archaeology should face the cognitive challenges posed by digital environments, changing in scope and rhythm. We advocate the adoption of a synergy between recording techniques, field analytics, and a collaborative approach to create a new epistemological perspective, one in which research questions are constantly redefined through real-time, collaborative analysis of data as they are collected and/or searched for in an excavation. Since new questions are defined in science discourse after previous results have been disseminated and discussed within the scientific community, sharing evidence in remote with colleagues, both in the process of field collection and subsequent study, will be a key innovative feature, allowing a complex and real-time distant interaction with the scholarly community and leading to more rapid improvements in research agendas and queries.

AB  - ABSTRACT The growth of open access publishing, the development of institutional repositories, and the availability of millions of digitized monographs and journals are rapidly changing scholarly communication. This case study looks at the current and possible uses of these tools by Michigan's three largest universities: Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. The authors explore their usefulness in fostering collaboration within the University Research Corridor (URC), an alliance of the three universities, as a specific example of scholarly research collaborations. The study also examines whether any shared use of these tools would further the related missions of the URC as well as their member universities and libraries toward the ultimate goal of helping the Michigan economy.

AB  - The ‘distributed national collection’ is a scheme whereby the British Library envisages completing agreements with other libraries to facilitate the development of specialized subject-based research collections in order to make the most of total national resources. The implementation in Australia of a similar scheme, the Distributed National Collection (DNC), was proposed during the late 1980s and 1990s, with the National Library (NLA) as a main advocate, and a great deal of enthusiasm was generated. The use of Conspectus was envisaged, and a DNC Office was set up at the NLA. It failed for various reasons: Conspectus proved unusable, the NLA had to cut back its own acquisitions, and financial restraints forced other libraries to look after their own interests. In the UK, the initiative for collaborative collection development has been driven by the British Library and the Higher Education Funding Councils. The UK has some features which give it a better chance of success - for instance, the responsible office should be independent of all the main players, whereas in Australia this responsibility could be carried only by the National Library; the UK has a more established network of research libraries, including a number outside the higher education/national library nexus; and the existence of BLDSC is highly beneficial. However, key challenges lie ahead, notably the complexities of managing the scheme, the time needed to put it into operation, the commitment demanded from participants (notably some sacrifice of local interests required for ‘deep resource sharing’), and obtaining the initial acceptance needed from users.

AB  - Después de 10 años de la declaración de Berlín, se ha realizado un estudio para definir unos indicadores de evaluación de repositorios, enfocados a la gestión interna y a la satisfacción de los usuarios. Se considera que no existe una sola forma de evaluar los repositorios, aunque sí se pueden dar unos criterios generales. Se ha realizado una recopilación de la bibliografía que trata sobrecriterios aplicados a la evaluación y análisis de repositorios institucionales y a partir de éstos, se ha establecido una propuesta propia que pueda ser aplicada a los repositorios institucionalescomo modelo potencial de evaluación. Se tendrán en cuenta en esta propuesta los factores que influyen en el rendimiento de los repositorios institucionales referentes a la gestión del repositorio. Como resultado, se proponen una serie de indicadores tecnológicos, de procesos,de marketing y de personal, que colaboren a que el repositorio sea una herramienta útil al usuario final y a la institución.

AB  - In their article, Marsden and Morgan-Short comprehensively review the current state and development trajectories for key areas within open research practices, both in general as well as more particularly in the context of language sciences. As the article reveals, the scope of open research practices is enormous and essentially touches upon every aspect of performing and interacting with research. The authors touch upon the lack of an established metascience within language sciences that would help inform and guide development of research practices, but, as I see it, the problem is universal, and there would be benefit in creating a stronger and more cohesive metascience discipline in general. While researchers have established practices of research, education, and dedicated scholarly communication outlets within the philosophy of science, history of science, information science, and higher education policy, metascience has remained an area where the discussion is highly distributed and appears sporadically across diverse research disciplines. As Marsden and Morgan-Short's review demonstrates, there are a lot of open questions relating to how to move forward on a global scale in the best interest of research and researchers. A more cohesive core of metascience would aid in the creation of immediately useful knowledge. One key perspective I would like to put forward to facilitate further structured reflection on the complex challenges surrounding open research practices in language sciences as well as in other disciplines is that of alignment seeking between top-down policies (e.g., mandates by funders or institutions for making publications or data open, institutional involvement in research infrastructures) and bottom-up practices (researchers taking particular practices into use by themselves, driven primarily by intrinsic motivation). Researchers in general have a lot of autonomy within their work, an aspect which creates a unique environment for the creation and wider adoption of new practices. The initial spark for many (I dare say most) open research practices and services for operating them have often been spawned as researcher-driven initiatives, for example, IRIS (Marsden & Mackey, 2014) and OASIS (Marsden et al., 2018) for research in language learning, without top-down requirement or enforcement. Today science policy, particularly within the European Union, is heavily influencing the uptake of open research practices by introducing requirements and monitoring for their compliance both through the open science requirements stated in the grant agreements of their own research funding instruments but also more generally for member countries to implement and report back on. However, if the requirements given top down are experienced as irrelevant and disconnected from the research context as seen by researchers, there is risk of alienation and a negative outcome for adoption (Lilja, 2020). Alignment of policy and practice in the context of open research practices is no easy challenge—balancing variables such as timing, sensitivity to the needs of individual research disciplines, research assessment, technological maturity, and practical feasibility runs the risk of friction in many regards. Even though challenging, alignment is necessary to smoothly scale useful new practices beyond the pioneering early adopters who take them into use in a bottom-up way. While the democratization of research that the internet has enabled has been a strong positive force for spurring innovation in the space of open research practices, the distributed nature of the environment introduces new threats to the scholarly record. The risk of open research initiatives being held up by solely volunteer effort without robust organizational backing can be very destructive as it could mean that valuable scholarly resources vanish, as has been the case, for example, for hundreds of open access scholarly journals (Laakso et al., 2021). Once new practices gain momentum it would be wise for institutions and policymakers to meet the research community halfway, that is, to align and to facilitate the creation of robustness to otherwise vulnerable services. One should not require or mandate practices that do not yet exist or have demonstrated potential, but if those leading in the field wait too long or support the wrong action or actors, this can lead to loss of momentum or even worse. In the case of IRIS and OASIS, this concern has been exemplarily catered to through early involvement of institutional support from both research performing as well as research funding organizations. What could then help aid alignment of policy and practice where circumstances are currently not yet so optimal for open research practices? Marsden and Morgan-Short highlighted that changes in research assessment have the potential to substantially alleviate some of the adoption challenges that open research practices have faced. This is a persistently recurring theme in panel discussions on open research practices in which I have been involved for over the last decade: Without change in assessment, researchers will never get anywhere regardless of what is built and recommended to be used. Change in research assessment was also singled out as the most substantial obstacle for change in scholarly publishing and scholarly communication in the final report of a recent expert group of which I was part (European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, 2019). Despite the buzz around the San Franscisco Declaration of Research Assessment, it is still common for institutions to lack integration of open research practices as part of research assessment (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2023). One issue has been the lack of taking tangible steps to fundamentally changing practices rather than just signaling support towards the greater cause of diversification in research assessment. The recently launched Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (2022) seeks organizational signatories to commit to and follow up the development of their assessment practices. It remains to be seen what effect this substantial new initiative will have on the landscape, but it carries the potential to help with the alignment of policy and practice in a way that the Declaration of Research Assessment has not done beyond initiating a very important discussion and creating a general direction among stakeholders. Researchers as highly autonomous actors need to perceive tangible use and acknowledgement of investing their time and effort into open research practices, otherwise these practices run the risk of never reaching their full potential in improving the research system.

AB  - Elsevier is currently positioned as the largest scholarly publisher, a dominant force in open access publishing, and a provider of workflow and analytics tools for research and science. Now it is slated to serve as the sole subcontractor in the European Commission's Open Science Monitor, cementing its role as a leading data analytics provider in the industry. This dominance across multiple sectors is bringing increased scrutiny from researchers and advocates for open science and open access to research. With loud objections to Elsevier's role in the Open Science Monitor project and contentious license negotiations as Germany and Sweden attempt to combine their big deals with open access publishing services, the role of traditional publishers in new models of scholarly communication and research support is being questioned more than ever.

AB  - Abstract This paper discusses user needs for a system that indexes tables and figures culled from scientific journal articles. These findings are taken from a comprehensive investigation into scientists' satisfaction with and use of a tables and figures retrieval prototype. Much previous research has examined the usability and features of digital libraries and other online retrieval systems that retrieve either full‐text of journal articles, traditional article‐level abstracts, or both. In contrast, this paper examines the needs of users directly searching for and accessing discrete journal article components – figures, tables, graphs, maps, and photographs – that have been individually indexed.

AB  - The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) has amassed large databases (including paleontological) as a result of its research on the geology of the ocean floor.ODP has begun to present its research results in electronic proceedings that will soon completely displace paper publications.Palaeontologia Electronica (PE) has pioneered the concept of an all-electronic paleontological journal with no paper equivalent.The publication and distribution of electronic data and scholarly papers are no longer the cutting edge of publishing technology; the cutting edge now moves to the next generation of electronic documents.The wide experience gathered by ODP and PE, from the collection of drilled cores and data, through preliminary reports to final scholarly publication, has provided the historical background.The next generation of electronic publications will include refinement of some of the present elements supported by technological improvements to create a product that meets the full spectrum of needs within the scientific community.The goals for these publications should include the creation of a truly dynamic platform for the exchange of information and ideas; the permanent, long-term archive of published materials and the data on which they are based; improved world-wide access; and a realistic and improved presentation of text, data, graphics, and other media.

AB  - Introduction: Research data management (RDM) is being recognized as an increasingly important role for librarians. In this paper, the role of health science librarians in supporting research data management endeavors is examined.&#x0D; Methods: All job postings currently (as of April 5th, 2018) available on the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information (iSchool) job site were analyzed to identify positions related to health science librarianship. The job responsibilities and descriptions were then examined to identify instances where research data management was mentioned.&#x0D; Results: Thirty-two postings from the search results were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Of these thirty-two health science librarian postings which were included in the analysis, eight included supporting research data management services, in some capacity, as part of the position description.&#x0D; Discussion/ Conclusion: Through the job posting analysis, a picture emerges where RDM is not consistently seen as a role for health science librarians. However, the literature indicates that in many instances, research data management is already being done by health science librarians, and is a trend which is likely to continue in the future. As such, it is important that research data management services start being acknowledged and reflected in education and job description opportunities.

AB  - An array of browser extensions has been developed to help researchers locate full-text content, whether that full text is available in an institutional repository, on a publishers site, or in an open access journal. Examples of such browser extensions include Unpaywall, Kopernio, EZproxy tools, and Lean Library. This Balance Point column focuses on the growth of browser extensions, the need they are filling, and their adoption by libraries. Particular attention is paid to the Lean Library browser extension and the services offered by Lean Library. Drawing on the literature and interviews with librarians in the field, the advantages and disadvantages of browser extensions are addressed, as well as security concerns.

AB  - Drawing on an original methodology using citations, downloads, and survey data, this paper analyzes journal usage patterns across 28 Canadian universities. Results show that usage levels vary across disciplines and that different academic platforms varied in their importance to different institutions, with for-profit platforms generally exhibiting lower usage. These results suggest economic inefficiencies exist in "big deal" academic journal subscriptions for universities, as most journals in such bundles are seldom or never used. We recommend that universities coordinate resource sharing and negotiate strategies with academic journal expenditures based on shared interests and usage trends.

AB  - Journal publishers play an important role in the open research data ecosystem. Through open data policies that include public data archiving mandates and data availability statements, journal publishers help promote transparency in research and wider access to a growing scholarly record. The library and information science (LIS) discipline has a unique relationship with both open data initiatives and academic publishing and may be well-positioned to adopt rigorous open data policies. This study examines the information provided on public-facing websites of LIS journals in order to describe the extent, and nature, of open data guidance provided to prospective authors. Open access journals in the discipline have disproportionately adopted detailed, strict open data policies. Commercial publishers, which account for the largest share of publishing in the discipline, have largely adopted weaker policies. Rigorous policies, adopted by a minority of journals, describe the rationale, application, and expectations for open research data, while most journals that provide guidance on the matter use hesitant and vague language. Recommendations are provided for strengthening journal open data policies.

AB  - This is a case study about the creation of open science services in the University of Eastern Finland. The library has overseen the open science services that have been actively implemented from 2010 onwards due to the development of the digitalisation of science and open science policies. A survey was conducted to determine how the UEF's academic faculty use the services provided as well as their attitudes towards opening their own research findings in this manner. The researchers seem to be most interested in issues that influence their daily work, i.e. data management plans and opening their publications. It seems that the culture of openness is still at the development stage within UEF. The innovators, i.e. active research groups and researchers, are already practicing and encouraging openness, but the majority of the academic staff seems to be either unaware of open science or unwilling to implement it, due to the fact that incentives and career advancements still support the traditional way of conducting research.

AB  - &#x0D; This case study critically examines ongoing developments in contemporary scholarship through the lens of research data management support at KU Leuven, and KU Leuven Libraries in particular. By means of case-based examples, current initiatives for fostering sound scientific work and scholarship are considered in three associated domains: support for policy-making, the development of research infrastructures, and digital literacy training for students, scientists and scholars. It is outlined how KU Leuven Libraries collaborates with partner services in order to contribute to KU Leuven’s research data management support network. Particular attention is devoted to the innovations that facilitate such collaborations. These accounts of initial experiences form the basis for a reflection on best practices and pitfalls, and foreground a number of pertinent challenges facing the domain of research data management, including matters of scalability, technology acceptance and adoption, and methods for effectively gauging and communicating the manifold transformations of science and scholarship.&#x0D;

AB  - As part of the current move towards open science, there is increasing pressure for scientists to share their research data. In support of this, several journals only publish descriptions of data generated from research: data papers. It is not clear whether this service encourages data reuse, however. This article assesses the prevalence and impact of the largest such journal, Data in Brief, comparing it with 24 other general or specialist data journals. The results show that Data in Brief became the largest data journal in 2016 and that its papers attracted over five Mendeley readers each, within a year of publication, as well as a non-trivial amount of citations. Its papers have been cited for relevance or facts contained in them in addition to acknowledging the reuse of associated datasets in about 1% of cases. Some papers describe electronic datasets whereas other papers embedded tables or images that formed the shared data. Overall, the journal seems to make a positive contribution to science by enabling access to multiple types of data, even though its papers rarely lead to data reuse.

AB  - Research papers can be visualized as a networked information space that contains a collection of information entities, inter-connected by directed links, commonly known as citation graph.There is a possibility to enrich the citation graph with meaningful relations using semantic tags.We have discovered and evaluated more than 150 citations' reasons from the existing published literature to be represented as citation tags.Many of these reasons have overlapped and diffused meanings.Annotating such a large volume of citation graphs with citation's reasons manually is nearly impossible, giving rise to a need to discover the citation's reasons automatically with high accuracy.The first step towards this is developing a minimal set of citation's context and reasons that are disjoint in nature.It would be a great help to the reasoning system if these reasons are represented in a formal way in the form of an ontology.By adopting a welldefined scientific methodology to formulate an ontology of citation reasons, we have reduced 150 reasons into only eight disjoint reasons, using an iterative process of sentiment analysis, collaborative meanings, and experts' opinions.Based on our findings and experiments, we have proposed a citation's context and reasons ontology (CCRO) that provides abstract conceptualization required to organize citations' relations.CCRO has been verified, validated, and assessed by using the well-defined procedures and tools proposed in the literature for ontology evaluation.The results show that the proposed ontology is concise, complete, and consistent.For the instantiation and mapping of ontology classes on real data, we have developed a mapping graph among the verbs with predicative complements in the English Language, the verbs extracted from the selected corpus using the NLP and CCRO classes.Using this mapping graph, the mapping of ontology classes in each citation's sentiment is explained with a complete mapping on the selected dataset.

AB  - This paper presents the rationales and the logical architecture of Geolat — Geography for Latin Literature, a project for the enrichment of Latin literature which makes use of a complex mix of TEI markup, Semantic Web technologies and formal ontologies. The purpose of Geolat is the annotation of the geographical and personal references in a corpus of Latin TEI encoded texts. These annotations are linked to a set of ontologies that give them formal semantics, and can finally be exposed the as linked open data, in order to improve the documents' interoperability with other existing LOD and to enhance information retrieval possibilities. The paper is organized as follows: first we introduce the project in order to explain the steps needed to complete it (section 2); then we describe the ontological modeling and the TEI encoding in Geolat, by focusing on both places and persons (section 3). We then discuss the annotation data model (section 4). In conclusion, we introduce some future directions (section 5).

AB  - The Web, with its explosive growth, is becoming an efficient resource for up-todate information for the scientific researcher.Informal online archives are repositories for technical reports.Proceedings are more and more commonly published on the Web.The collection of online journals is growing.Indeed, a good number of online journals are "born digital".Many researchers simply put their papers up on their own web site.The large volume of online material makes it quite desirable to be able to access cited documents immediately from the citing paper.Implementing this direct access is called "reference linking".Some reference linking services exist today.A number of commercial publishers, recognizing the significant value-added nature of reference linking, have banded together to form the CrossRef organization.The CrossRef publishers share their metadata, which enables them to interlink their journals.This metadata is not, however, available without a fee to organizations or individuals outside of CrossRef.The vast majority of online scholarly literature is accompanied by little or no metadata.Since it is desirable to link up this literature as well, the problem of automatically reference linking online scholarly literature in the absence of metadata and author intervention is a problem very much worth considering.This paper explores this problem in detail, and presents some algorithms for extracting metadata from online texts and linking full-text documents together.The extent to which reference linking of the online literature can be done automatically is therefore the main topic of this paper.

AB  - Scientific document understanding is challenging as the data is highly domain specific and diverse.However, datasets for tasks with scientific text require expensive manual annotation and tend to be small and limited to only one or a few fields.At the same time, scientific documents contain many potential training signals, such as citations, which can be used to build large labelled datasets.Given this, we present an in-depth study of cite-worthiness detection in English, where a sentence is labelled for whether or not it cites an external source.To accomplish this, we introduce CITEWORTH, a large, contextualized, rigorously cleaned labelled dataset for cite-worthiness detection built from a massive corpus of extracted plaintext scientific documents.We show that CITEWORTH is high-quality, challenging, and suitable for studying problems such as domain adaptation.Our best performing citeworthiness detection model is a paragraphlevel contextualized sentence labelling model based on Longformer, exhibiting a 5 F1 point improvement over SciBERT which considers only individual sentences.Finally, we demonstrate that language model fine-tuning with cite-worthiness as a secondary task leads to improved performance on downstream scientific document understanding tasks.

AB  - Information on occurrences of species and information on the specimens that are evidence for these occurrences (specimen records) is stored in different biodiversity databases. These databases expose the information via public REST API's. We focused on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), iDigBio, and PlutoF, and utilized their API's to import occurrence or specimen records directly into a manuscript edited in the ARPHA Writing Tool (AWT). Furthermore, major ecological and biological databases around the world provide information about their datasets in the form of EML. A workflow was developed for creating data paper manuscripts in AWT from EML files. Such files could be downloaded, for example, from GBIF, DataONE, or the Long-Term Ecological Research Network (LTER Network).

AB  - Local conditions in the past often limited opportunities for scholarly exchange. But now these limits are gone and the global workplace has replaced them. It is important to react to these changes. Every academic department must now adopt new methods and rethink processes. Another is the intense national and international debate about open access to scholarly knowledge. The Open Access Initiative shows that a change is taking place in the communication process. This change is also important for service departments within research institutions. Libraries, computer centers and related units have to ask themselves how to react appropriately to the new conditions. What services must be changed or redeveloped, and in what quality and quantity should they be offered? This article focuses on changes in the scholarly publication process. It describes both technological changes and the changes needed in people's attitudes.

AB  - This brief research report analyzes the availability of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) worldwide, highlighting the dominance of large publishing houses and the need for unique persistent identifiers to increase the visibility of publications from developing countries. The study reveals that a considerable amount of publications from developing countries are excluded from the global flow of scientific information due to the absence of DOIs, emphasizing the need for alternative publishing models. The authors suggest that the availability of DOIs should receive more attention in scholarly communication and scientometrics, contributing to a necessary debate on DOIs relevant for librarians, publishers, and scientometricians.

AB  - Digital libraries and the Web have brought enormously powerful search mechanisms to the desktops of many researchers.With the use of insights from cultural studies and the history and philosophy of science, it is argued that one likely outcome is a change in the acceptable standards for literature reviews, leading to changes in article contents to reflect a broader academic basis.As a result, researchers should be trained to read and evaluate material from a much wider range of subjects than previously necessary.The broadening base may impact science and non-science subjects differently.

AB  - This article considers the problem of preserving research software within the wider realm of digital curation, academic research libraries, and the scholarly record. We conducted a pilot study to understand the ecosystem in which research software participates, and to identify significant characteristics that have high potential to support future scholarly practices. A set of topical curation dimensions were derived from the extant literature and applied to select cases of institutionally significant research software. This approach yields our main contribution, a curation model and decision framework for preserving research software as a scholarly object. The results of our study highlight the unique characteristics and challenges at play in building curation services in academic research libraries.

The relationship of commercial publishers to the Open Access movement is compared to that of the creators/users of file sharers and the Record Industry. The library literature bears out the contention that journal publishers have exhibited some of the behaviors that contributed to the decline of the major record labels. Librarians who support free scholarship will find the music industry plight instructive; just as iTunes fulfilled consumer demand, Open Access and other alternatives will transform publishing.

AB  - Abstract The IUPAC centenary in 2019 is fast approaching, and this will naturally lead people to look back at the significant achievements of the organisation and its dedicated volunteers over the past one hundred years. Equally important, however, will be the need to look forward to the roles for IUPAC in its second century. This special issue of Chemistry International (CI) could well feature in that assessment, as technology in the digital age, and particularly the data that technology produces, will clearly be an essential tool for the future of chemistry as a discipline.

AB  - Abstract In 1950, Alan Turing proposed his eponymous test based on indistinguishability of verbal behavior as a replacement for the question “Can machines think?” Since then, two mutually contradictory but well‐founded attitudes towards the Turing Test have arisen in the philosophical literature. On the one hand is the attitude that has become philosophical conventional wisdom, viz., that the Turing Test is hopelessly flawed as a sufficient condition for intelligence, while on the other hand is the overwhelming sense that were a machine to pass a real live full‐fledged Turing Test, it would be a sign of nothing but our orneriness to deny it the attribution of intelligence. The arguments against the sufficiency of the Turing Test for determining intelligence rely on showing that some extra conditions are logically necessary for intelligence beyond the behavioral properties exhibited by an agent under a Turing Test. Therefore, it cannot follow logically from passing a Turing Test that the agent is intelligent. I argue that these extra conditions can be revealed by the Turing Test, so long as we allow a very slight weakening of the criterion from one of logical proof to one of statistical proof under weak realizability assumptions. The argument depends on the notion of interactive proof developed in theoretical computer science, along with some simple physical facts that constrain the information capacity of agents. Crucially, the weakening is so slight as to make no conceivable difference from a practical standpoint. Thus, the Gordian knot between the two opposing views of the sufficiency of the Turing Test can be cut.

AB  - Background. The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is helping the European to prepare for an integrative system for intelligent management of biodiversity knowledge. The infrastructure that is envisaged and that will be further developed within the Programme "Horizon 2020" aims to provide open and free access to taxonomic information to anyone with a requirement for biodiversity data, without the need for individual consent of other persons or institutions. Open and free access to information will foster the re-use and improve the quality of data, will accelerate research, and will promote new types of research. Progress towards the goal of free and open access to content is hampered by numerous technical, economic, sociological, legal, and other factors. The present article addresses barriers to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge that arise from European laws, in particular European legislation on copyright and database protection rights.We present a legal point of view as to what will be needed to bring distributed information together and facilitate its re-use by data mining, integration into semantic knowledge systems, and similar techniques. We address exceptions and limitations of copyright or database protection within Europe, and we point to the importance of data use agreements. We illustrate how exceptions and limitations have been transformed into national legislations within some European states to create inconsistencies that impede access to biodiversity information.Conclusions. The legal situation within the EU is unsatisfactory because there are inconsistencies among states that hamper the deployment of an open biodiversity knowledge management system. Scientists within the EU who work with copyright protected works or with protected databases have to be aware of regulations that vary from country to country. This is a major stumbling block to international collaboration and is an impediment to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge. Such differences should be removed by unifying exceptions and limitations for research purposes in a binding, Europe-wide regulation.

AB  - Open access (OA) has become a critical issue in science policy and affects a wide range of activities in universities and research labs. Research-performing organizations (RPOs), defined as publicly funded universities and research institutions, face significant challenges in shaping the OA transformation. This article examines the spheres of activity available to RPOs for shaping the OA transformation, using a categorization of 22 spheres of activity related to OA. These spheres of activity include strategy and communication, services and infrastructures, business relationships with publishers, and collaborations. Current challenges and future action areas in promoting OA are also described, providing support for RPOs in handling OA and highlighting key issues. The categorization can serve as a tool for systematically assessing OA activities at RPOs and shows that OA is a cross-cutting issue in these organizations. Collaboration on OA activities, both within and beyond organizations, presents a challenge. To effectively promote OA, it is crucial to strengthen the interaction between funding agencies and RPOs. Libraries are critical stakeholders, playing a vital role in advancing OA at the local, national, and international levels in partnership with RPO management and other partners in faculty, administration, and information technology.

AB  - There is a driving imperative for new knowledge, approaches and technologies to empower scholarship, especially in emerging areas of inquiry. Sources of information now extend beyond the written word to include a wide range of born-digital objects. This paper examines the changing landscape in which digital scholars find, collaborate, create and process information and, as a result, scholarship is being transformed. It discusses the key elements required to build an institutional infrastructure, which will not only support new practices but also integrate scholarly literature into emerging and evolving models that generate true digital scholarship. The paper outlines some of the major impediments in implementing such a model, as well as suggestions on how to overcome these barriers.

AB  - This paper reports on the outcomes of research assessing the nature and extent of print journal cancellations by Australian research libraries since 1990. The cancellation activity of two groups of libraries, one representing the national and state library sector and the other the university library sector, was examined. These two groups were tested for their cancellation of both Australian and international journals. From the results some conclusions are reached about the factors driving the cancellations and the implications these cancellations might have for the nation’s access to scholarly journal literature.

AB  - Open science is an ever-evolving phenomenon. Open science deals with the availability of data and publications, which includes an open approach with which publicly funded research is sought to be made available to all members of society and the public. It is an umbrella term that includes a multitude of assumptions about the future of knowledge creation and dissemination (Fecher &amp; Friesike, 2014). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) emphasizes libraries as a key player and fundamental drivers of open science because they have adapted their role to today’s age and are now active in preserving, publishing, and disseminating digital scientific material in the form of publications, data, and other research-relate content. During their studies, LIS (Library and information science(s)) students acquire knowledge and develop a set of skills that will prepare them for work in today’s information environment. In 2020. LIBER’s (Ligue des Bibliothèques Européennes de Recherche – Association of European Research Libraries) Digital Skills for Library Staff and Researchers Working Group published a visual presentation of the necessary competencies for librarians and researchers. Information science studies, including those in Croatia, are exposed to constant changes in the field, including the development of open science. For this reason, it is necessary to constantly think about the adaptation of study programs through which students will acquire basic knowledge related to the promotion and advocacy of open science. The term “open science”, and everything it encompasses, should be an integral part of study programs in the field of information sciences. The aim of this paper is to explore the representation of skills and competencies for open science in study programs at the LIS studies in Croatia: Department of Information and Communication Sciences (Zagreb), Department of information sciences (Osijek) and Department of information science (Zadar). This research indicated the need for greater inclusion of the concepts of scientific communication and open science in the learning outcomes at the level of programs in the study of information sciences in Zadar, Zagreb, and Osijek.

AB  - The Library Publishing Coalition (LPC) defines library publishing as the “creation, dissemination, and curation of scholarly, creative, and/or educational works” by college and university libraries. While providing a publishing platform, hosting, and services for editorial teams is key to any library publishing initiative, library publishing is also centered on furthering core library values. Thus library publishing activities are mission-driven, centered on education, and focused on finding and promoting sustainable approaches to open access publishing and building cooperative open infrastructure.

AB  - This article is a contribution towards an understanding of open access (OA) publishing. It proposes an analysis framework of 18 core attributes, divided into the areas of bibliographic information, activity metrics, economics, accessibility, and predatory issues. The framework has been employed in a systematic analysis of 30 OA journals in software engineering (SE) and information systems (IS), which were selected from among 386 OA journals in Computer Science from the Directory of OA Journals. An analysis was performed on the sample of the journals, to provide an overview of the current situation of OA journals in the fields of SE and IS. The journals were then compared between-group, according to the presence of article processing charges. A within-group analysis was performed on the journals requesting article processing charges from authors, in order to understand what is the value added according to different price ranges. This article offers several contributions. It presents an overview of OA definitions and models. It provides an analysis framework born from the observation of data and the existing literature. It raises the need to study OA in the fields of SE and IS while offering a first analysis. Finally, it provides recommendations to readers of OA journals. This paper highlights several concerns still threatening the adoption of OA publishing in the fields of SE and IS. Among them, it is shown that high article processing charges are not sufficiently justified by the publishers, which often lack transparency and may prevent authors from adopting OA.

AB  - Open access (OA) publication has emerged, with disruptive effects, as a major outlet for scholarly publication. OA publication is usually associated with on-line distribution and provides access to scholarly publications to anyone, anywhere–regardless of their ability to pay subscription fees or their association with an educational institution. The article overviews the growth and impact of OA publication in Canada and elsewhere. The article also presents a case study of the evolution over its first nine years of the International Review of Research in Open and Distance Education (IRRODL). IRRODL has become the most widely read and widely cited journal in the distance education and open learning community, yet it continues to struggle for recognition by some academics, funding, and rating organizations.&#x0D; In this article IRRODL’s editors document the challenges involved in leading the charge for equal support for open access journals from Canada’s research funding organizations and for review and accreditation from commercial and non-commercial review services. In its literature review section the article looks at scholarly works documenting and comparing on-line journals to ones that publish in paper only, or in which access is restricted behind the walls of licensed use.&#x0D; &#x0D; The article also documents issues related to various innovations, including production of articles in both text and audio formats, and the challenges of incorporating more interactive media into a scholarly, peer- reviewed journal. Data is produced demonstrating the ways in which 72 CJHE / RCES Volume 39, No. 3, 2009 influence and impact for open access journals can be measured, including hit rates and citations reference data from Google Scholar. The article concludes with a description and discussion of the advantages and challenges of using review and publication management tools such as Open Journal System in the production of open access journals.&#x0D;

AB  - Purpose – This purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the document delivery service according to user perception, and a usage analysis was done to inform collection building and refining. This is especially important in a high-calibre research community, where the usage, interests and research groups and disciplines are still evolving. Design/methodology/approach – To collect the responses of document delivery service users, an online questionnaire was used with 12 multiple-choice questions and two open-ended questions. The questionnaires were sent only to the users of this service, and the responses were collected anonymously. Two surveys were conducted, in 2010 and 2013, with the same questions. The responses are displayed graphically prepared to compare the results. There were 71 responses in 2010 and 95 in 2013. Findings – In both surveys, the majority of users rated the service, staff behaviour, speed, quality, etc. with a high satisfaction level. Document delivery order statistics are a major decision-making tool, in addition to usage analysis, for developing a better, economical and highly utilized collection in brand new libraries. Originality/value – This is the first published study of user perception of document delivery in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - ABSTRACT Two-sided markets are a relatively new economic concept that has relevance for scholarly communications. Scholarly journals, as well as bundles of scholarly journals, can best be understood as examples of two-sided markets, and journal-pricing issues can best be examined using this concept. Serials librarians, electronic resources librarians, and scholarly communications specialists should incorporate two-sided markets into their understanding of the shifting journals environment.

AB  - Sharing research data and scholarship is of national importance because of the increased focus on maximizing return on the U.S. government's investment in research programs. Recent government policy changes have directly affected the management and accessibility of publically funded research. On January 18, 2011, the National Science Foundation, a U.S. agency that supports research and education in nonmedical fields, required that data management plans be submitted with all grant proposals. On February 22, 2013, the U.S. President's Office of Science and Technology Policy extended a similar requirement for all federal agencies with research and development budgets of more than $100 million. These requirements illustrate the need for further coordination and management of data as scholarship with traditional publications. Purdue University Libraries and its Joint Transportation Research Program (JTRP) collaborated to develop a comprehensive work flow that links technical report production with the management and publication of associated data. This paper illustrates early initiatives to integrate discrete data publications with traditional scholarly publications by leveraging new and existing repository platforms and services. The authors review government policies, past data-sharing practices, early pilot initiatives, and work flow integration between Purdue's data repository, the traditional press, and institutional repository. Through the adoption of these work flows, the authors propose best practices for integrating data publishing and dissemination into the research process. The implementation of this model has the potential to assist researchers in meeting the requirements of federal funding agencies, while reducing redundancy, ensuring integrity, expanding accessibility, and increasing the return on research investment.

AB  - Significant amounts of knowledge in science and technology have so far not been published as Linked Open Data but are contained in the text and tables of legacy PDF publications. Making such information available as RDF would, for example, provide direct access to claims and facilitate surveys of related work. A lot of valuable tabular information that till now only existed in PDF documents would also finally become machine understandable. Instead of studying scientific literature or engineering patents for months, it would be possible to collect such input by simple SPARQL queries. The SemAnn approach enables collaborative annotation of text and tables in PDF documents, a format that is still the common denominator of publishing, thus maximising the potential user base. The resulting annotations in RDF format are available for querying through a SPARQL endpoint. To incentivise users with an immediate benefit for making the effort of annotation, SemAnn recommends related papers, taking into account the hierarchical context of annotations in a novel way. We evaluated the usability of SemAnn and the usefulness of its recommendations by analysing annotations resulting from tasks assigned to test users and by interviewing them. While the evaluation shows that even few annotations lead to a good recall, we also observed unexpected, serendipitous recommendations, which confirms the merit of our low-threshold annotation support for the crowd.

AB  - Purpose To provide an overview of, the relationship between the British Library and higher education libraries in the 1990s, with particular relation to document supply. It also goes on to explore current developments in scholarly communication. Design/methodology/approach The author played a role in several of the events described and uses the available literature to enlarge on a personal view of that decade. Findings The paper shows that the relationship was a strained one caused in part by a mismatch of resources, but is in any case dwarfed by the larger external forces and changing opportunities and technologies for scholarly communication. Originality/value Provides a record of the period.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution has paved the way for emerging technologies, and among them, blockchain stands out for its unprecedented ability to create and trade value in library organizations. This research paper explores the potential application of blockchain technologies in 21st-century library services. By conducting a systematic analysis of the literature, this study examines how libraries can harness blockchain to support innovative services and meet global demands. The study suggests that the recent advancements in blockchain have led to a fourth generation of the technology, which possesses disruptive capabilities across diverse fields, including library and information science. The paper proposes that blockchain can enhance library services such as collection development, circulation services, research, data management, and storage. It is important to note that this paper represents the original ideas of the authors and does not rely on copyrighted materials. Furthermore, it highlights that blockchain remains a vast and underexplored area of research, presenting both challenges and opportunities for library professionals seeking to provide diverse library services.

AB  - The number of scholarly publications grows steadily every year and it becomes harder to find, assess and compare scholarly knowledge effectively. Scholarly knowledge graphs have the potential to address these challenges. However, creating such graphs remains a complex task. We propose a method to crowdsource structured scholarly knowledge from paper authors with a web-based user interface supported by artificial intelligence. The interface enables authors to select key sentences for annotation. It integrates multiple machine learning algorithms to assist authors during the annotation, including class recommendation and key sentence highlighting. We envision that the interface is integrated in paper submission processes for which we define three main task requirements: The task has to be . We evaluated the interface with a user study in which participants were assigned the task to annotate one of their own articles. With the resulting data, we determined whether the participants were successfully able to perform the task. Furthermore, we evaluated the interface's usability and the participant's attitude towards the interface with a survey. The results suggest that sentence annotation is a feasible task for researchers and that they do not object to annotate their articles during the submission process.

AB  - The lack of consistent training for scholarly authors, peer reviewers, and editors is a problem across disciplines, but it is one that affects academic librarians in a unique variety of ways. Like instructional faculty, academic librarians are generally required to engage in scholarly activity, but they are also increasingly in the position of providing guidance on and advocating for emerging trends in scholarly communication. This presentation will describe how the creation of a student-run journal and an associated scholarly communication course in Western University’s Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS) are helping to meet this need. L'absence d'une formation cohérente pour les auteurs, les évaluateurs et les éditeurs des communications savantes, est un problème dans toutes les disciplines de recherche, mais aussi un problème qui affecte les bibliothécaires universitaires de différentes manières. À l'instar des professeurs, les bibliothécaires universitaires sont généralement tenus de s'engager dans des activités savantes, mais ils se retrouvent aussi de plus en plus dans une position où ils doivent guider les chercheurs et leur fournir des conseils sur les tendances émergentes de la communication savante. Cette présentation décrira comment la création d'une revue dirigée par des étudiants et qu'un cours sur la communication savante dans la faculté d'information et des études des médias de la Western University peuvent contribuer à répondre à ces besoins.

AB  - In Fall 2013, Carmichael Library at the University of Montevallo (UM), Alabama's public liberal arts university, surveyed users about their current and potential eBook and eBook reader usage.The library has been cautious with regards to eBooks adoption, partly due to budgetary restraints along with a lack of knowledge about our users' eBook preferences.While the primary interest of the survey is in student use, faculty and staff were also surveyed so that all patron groups were represented.Undergraduate students were the highest responders, with staff and faculty closely behind.The results show that a healthy percentage of library patrons are currently using eBooks with varying frequency, offering a chance for growth of the collection.The time has come for UM to proceed with eBook collection development informed by research and survey results.<http://www.against-the-grain.com>purchases, the caution with implementation is much more understandable.

AB  - In 1947 IFLA signed a cooperation agreement with the newly created UNESCO. This article reviews the evolution of the relationship between IFLA and UNESCO since 1947, and evaluates what this relationship has contributed to the international library and information community. The review falls into three periods: (1) from 1947 to 1977, when IFLA worked closely with UNESCO’s Libraries Division (later the Department of Documentation, Libraries and Archives); (2) from 1977, when the General Information Programme was founded, to 2000, when this Programme was merged with the Intergovernmental Informatics Programme (IIP); and (3) from 2001 to the present time, with particular reference to the UNESCO Information for All Programme (IFAP). As UNESCO gradually shifted its attention away from libraries to documentation and later information society issues, UNESCO’s importance to IFLA as a source of support declined, but possibilities remain for fruitful, mutually beneficial relationships between them.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this article is to review the trend in academic libraries toward including scholarly communication, and by extension, electronic publishing, as part of their core mission, using the Cornell University Library as an example.Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes several manifestations of publishing activity organized under the Library's Center for Innovative Publishing, including the arXiv (http://arxiv.org/), Project Euclid (http://projecteuclid.org), and DPubS (http://DPubS.org).Findings – Libraries bring many competencies to the scholarly communications process, including expertise in digital initiatives, close connections with authors and readers, and a commitment to preservation. To add publishing to their responsibilities, they need to develop expertise in content acquisition, editorial management, contract negotiation, marketing, and subscription management.Originality/value – Academic libraries are making formal and informal publishing a part of their core activi...

AB  - Collection development in medium to large academic libraries typically involves multiple subject librarians or “liaisons.” The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Libraries have lost significant numbers of personnel in the last four years due to attrition and retirements, including most of the professional liaison librarians whose positions will not be replaced in the foreseeable future. In addition to this challenge, collection budgets have been severely reduced due to the State of Alaska's ongoing budget crisis, necessitating large cancellation projects. This article examines UAF Libraries’ collection strategies used to sustain a research-intensive collection without liaisons and with a drastically reduced budget.

AB  - Over the past 10 years, there has been a noticeable increase of crowdsourcing projects in cultural heritage institutions, where digital technologies are being used to open up their collections and encourage the public to engage with them in a very direct way. Libraries, archives and museums have long had a history and mandate of outreach and public engagement but crowdsourcing marks a move towards a more participatory and inclusive model of engagement. If a library wants to start a crowdsourcing project, what do they need to know?&#x0D; This article is written from a Canadian University library perspective with the goal to help the reader engage with the current crowdsourcing landscape. This article’s contribution includes a literature review and a survey of popular projects and platforms; followed by a case study of a crowdsourcing pilot completed at the McGill Library. The article pulls these two threads of theory and practice together—with a discussion of some of the best practices learned through the literature and real-life experience, giving the reader practical tools to help a library evaluate if crowdsourcing is right for them, and how to get a desired project off the ground.

AB  - Librarians from the Galter Health Sciences Library at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine undertook a citation analysis study in early 2017 to supplement traditional electronic journal usage data in the hopes of more effectively demonstrating journals’ value. The authors developed a methodology for gathering comprehensive publication and citation data for authors affiliated with the Feinberg School of Medicine, using Web of Science as the primary data source. Using this data, various metrics were employed to measure and evaluate journals in institutional and field-specific contexts, including co-citation networks, and increases or decreases of references over time per title. These metrics were compared against more traditional tools like Counting Online Usage of Networked Electronic Resources usage reports, cost-per-use analysis, and interlibrary loan statistics, to identify correlations and discrepancies. This use case demonstrates the potential value of incorporating publication and citation metrics into library collection development and evaluation practices.

AB  - Given the rapidly changing economics of scholarly communication in the digital age, the importance of accurate, specific data on the resource flows within this realm has become increasingly important.Both the producers and the collectors of scholarly information require accurate information in order to nimbly navigate their changing roles in advancing the progress of knowledge.Two key actors in this area are university presses and academic libraries, which both hold keystone roles in scholarly communications, as disseminators and conservators of scholarship, respectively.This paper describes an exploratory study examining one contentious aspect of the relationship between these two actors: trends in purchases of university press books by academic libraries.It does so in order to provide an empirical basis for evaluating frequent claims by publishers that declines in libraries' monographic purchasing over the past three decades can be held primarily responsible for the declining economic fortunes of university presses over the same period.The results of this analysis indicate that this relationship is not clear-cut, for at least two reasons: first, to the extent that purchasing reductions have occurred, they have occurred much more recently than prior accounts have suggested, and second, purchasing trends vary significantly between different libraries and between different sizes of university press.

AB  - In this paper we describe the pragmatic approach of initiating, designing and implementing the Data Management Plan (DMP) and the data FAIRification process in the multidisciplinary Horizon 2020 nanotechnology project, Anticipating Safety Issues at the Design Stage of NAno Product Development (ASINA). We briefly describe the general DMP requirements, emphasizing that the initial steps in the direction towards data FAIRification must be conceptualized and visualized in a systematic way. We demonstrate the use of a generic questionnaire to capture primary data and metadata description from our consortium (data creators/experimentalists and data analysts/modelers). We then display the interactive process with external FAIR data initiatives (data curators/quality assessors), regarding guidance for data and metadata capturing and future integration into repositories. After the preliminary data capturing and FAIRification template is formed, the inner-communication process begins between the partners, which leads to developing case-specific templates. This paper assists future data creators, data analysts, stewards and shepherds engaged in the multi-faceted data shepherding process, in any project, by providing a roadmap, demonstrated in the case of ASINA.

AB  - This study has established the perceived benefits and barriers of using online journal systems (OJS). A descriptive research design alongside a quantitative approach was used to establish perceived benefits and barriers of using online journal systems among University of Dar es Salaam faculty members. In the study data were gathered through survey questionnaires. The data were then organized and summarized through descriptive statistics in form of frequencies and percentages. The study reveals that a significant number of faculty members infrequently use the systems in their scholarly communication. Along this, the study reveals various benefits of using OJS as perceived by faculty members. The study also reveals diverse perceived barriers that undermine effective use of the systems. These include low internet bandwidth and technical difficulties. The study recommends that the UDSM has to take deliberate measures to enhance internet services through increasing bandwidth, alongside increasing training on the use of online journal systems.

AB  - In this editorial, we describe the work that has been undertaken by the ESTS editorial collective (EC) over the last two years towards establishing a publishing infrastructure for open research data. A broad movement in the scholarly community is pushing towards data sharing or “open data,” particularly in the natural sciences and medicine. Recognizing that there are compelling reasons why scholars are wary of data sharing and careful to protect their work, our EC has pursued experiments towards establishing a publishing infrastructure. The goal is to better understand the possible benefits for the STS community from data sharing and the role that a scholarly-run journal like ESTS could play in realizing such opportunities. The sharing of data could serve as an archive of work in/for STS; offer greater recognition of diverse contributions to scholarly research beyond individual author(s); enable reuse of data for new insights and pedagogical opportunities; and engender new forms of scholarly community in the field.

AB  - This paper analyzes recent literature on or using the term “open pedagogy” in order to distill a working definition. The term is currently contested, and is discarded completely by some influencers due to a lack of definition and thus usefulness as a rigorous academic term. This study analyzes how researchers currently use the term in the literature, searching for commonalities, with the goal of proposing a synthesis that encompasses the majority of the field and can provide potential common ground for further research on the subject. The result was a pool of 98 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, which were then scanned and classified to develop a taxonomy. The taxonomy was used to construct a working definition of open pedagogy as any pedagogy informed by the practitioners’ conscious identification with the open movement, open access, and open educational resources (OER). In effect, open pedagogy describes the interaction between the open movement and pedagogy, whereas open educational practices (OEP) and OER-enabled pedagogy describe the actual practices arising from that pedagogical approach.

AB  - Scientific communication has undergone deep transformations, since the emergence of Internet. Aiming to provide further thought on the evolution of scientific communication, this paper features a historical overview of the scientific communication advances over the last twenty years through a three-phase model for the evolution of the electronic journal and the preprints services, and presents Brazilian contemporary panorama for scientific communication. The three-phase model presented in this work is an adaptation of that one proposed by Tenopir et al. (2003) to describe the patterns of journal use by scientists since 1990. The early evolutionary phase followed the emergence of the first digital journals and the creation of repositories in the Web for publishing preliminary versions of scientific literature on the author’s initiative; by that time, most academics reproved electronic publishing initiatives. From 1996 and forward, in the consolidation phase, electronic journals were commonly identical to their print counterparts; the acceptance of the electronic format began to increase, and preprint services got underway in several disciplines. The advanced evolutionary phase started with the world discussion on open access to scientific information. The comparison of the current electronic journal with that viewed by enthusiasts in the first years of the 1990s shows that some aspects still remain to be improved in electronic formal and informal communication, towards effective dissemination of scientific information.

AB  - The text that follows is a slightly revised extract from my doctoral thesis (Francke 2008) [1]. It draws on the notions of information architecture and document architecture to identify a set of concepts for analysing documents as sociotechnical artefacts. The analytical tool was developed for the purpose of analysing scholarly journals, which has tinged it to some extent, but it is likely applicable also for analysis of other document types and genres. As part of identifying concepts, I refer to several of the more established ways of conceptualising information architecture and document architecture. As such, the text may provide an introduction to these two areas, as they looked a few years ago when the thesis was prepared. The article may thus be of interest both as a first introduction to the two perspectives and from a theoretical and methodological point of view

AB  - Although digitalization and the emergence of the Internet has caused a long-term crisis for copyright law, technology itself also seems to offer a seemingly ideal solution to the challenges of digital age: copyright has been a major use case for algorithmic enforcement from the early days of digital rights management technologies to the more advanced content recognition algorithms. These technologies identify and filter possibly infringing content automatically, effectively and often in a preventive fashion. These methods have been criticized for their shortcomings, such as the lack of transparency, bias and the possible impairment of fundamental rights. Self-learning machines and semi-autonomous AI have the potential to offer even more sophisticated and expeditious enforcement by code, however, they could also aggravate the aforementioned issues. As the EU legislator envisions to make the use of such technologies essentially obligatory for certain online content sharing service providers (via the infamous Article 17 of the directive on copyright in the digital single market), the assessment of the situation in light of future technological development has become a current topic.This paper aims to identify the main issues and potential long-term consequences of creating legislation that practically requires the employment of such filtering algorithms as well as their solutions. This paper focuses on the potential role a broad copyright exception for text and data mining could play in counterbalancing the issues associated with algorithmic enforcement.

In general, 6 of the 8 indicators suggest that growth for Ciencias Marinas can be qualified somewhere between satisfactory and good. The other 2 indicators, SNIP (1999–2017) and SJR (2010–2017), did not show significant changes for the time period analyzed.

AB  - We posed the question of what services an academic library can best provide to support the NIH Public Access Policy. We approached the answer to this question through education, collaboration, and tool-building. As a result, over the last four years we have engaged over 1,500 participants in discussions of public access to research results, forged alliances with dozens of partners, and built online tools to ease the process of complying with the NIH policy. We conclude that librarians working in collaboration with other key constituencies can have a positive impact on improving access to the results of scientific research.

AB  - Based on a paper presented at the UKSG seminar 'Scientific Publications: Free for all?', The Geological Society, London, Tuesday 23 November 2004 This article offers a perspective about open access and the current 'churn' in scholarly journal publication from a collections development and scholarly communications specialist librarian in the United States. The differences between the US and UK higher education systems are not insignificant, the former being more extensive as well as more diverse in sources of funding support, with less direct involvement by national government. Thus, while librarians in both countries very much aim to improve various aspects of scholarly communications, their approaches and expectations may be somewhat different. The author suggests that much more experimentation with business models is needed before we can well understand the sustainability of open access, the models that can effectively support it, and to what extent. Early evidence suggests that there are no panaceas that will result in close to free journal publication; under an open access publishing system, the costs to research-intensive universities may well increase.

AB  - An increasing number of scientific publications are created in open and transparent peer review models: a submission is published first, and then reviewers are invited, or a submission is reviewed in a closed environment but then these reviews are published with the final article, or combinations of these. Reasons for open peer review include giving better credit to reviewers, and enabling readers to better appraise the quality of a publication. In most cases, the full, unstructured text of an open review is published next to the full, unstructured text of the article reviewed. This approach prevents human readers from getting a quick impression of the quality of parts of an article, and it does not easily support secondary exploitation, e.g., for scientometrics on reviews. While document formats have been proposed for publishing structured articles including reviews, integrated tool support for entire open peer review workflows resulting in such documents is still scarce. We present AR-Annotator, the Automatic Article and Review Annotator which employs a semantic information model of an article and its reviews, using semantic markup and unique identifiers for all entities of interest. The fine-grained article structure is not only exposed to authors and reviewers but also preserved in the published version. We publish articles and their reviews in a Linked Data representation and thus maximise their reusability by third party applications. We demonstrate this reusability by running quality-related queries against the structured representation of articles and their reviews.

AB  - Since the 2002 UNESCO forum, raising awareness of the benefits and challenges to Open Educational Resources (OER) in higher education have been integral to the broader Open Education (OE) movement. In the K-12 sector, however, an understanding of OER has been less advanced, although there are pockets of K-12 OER innovators throughout Canada and the United States. The 2015 U.S. Department of Education #GoOpen initiative, had over 20 American states move toward the use of K-12 OER, and within Canada, various provinces have begun investigating OER for both financial and pedagogical reasons. Because the use of K-12 OER inheres curricular decisions from the classroom teacher to all levels of governance, the move toward OER additionally involves a variety of sophisticated and complex digital and system-wide supports. This shift from the legacy educational system to the emerging practices where educators employ participatory technologies to curate, share out, and use student-generated curricular content requires awareness-building of these pedagogical and technological changes. Despite these impending shifts, the awareness, use, and the advocacy for K-12 OER as a nascent topic for professional learning, at present there are no dedicated specialist councils or professional organizations to support Canadian K-12 OER educators. To address this professional learning need, a virtual satellite conference was offered for in-service teachers as part of a network supported through the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), the Right to Research coalition, and the OpenCon platform. The OpenCon 2018 K-12 Athabasca virtual conference offered free professional learning regarding these changes in resource sourcing, creating, licensing, and sharing. Through meeting software, K-12 educators from Canada and beyond were able to learn about OER, Open Pedagogy, and the implications these changes bring to the teaching and learning processes. The virtual conference concluded with the Remix Panel that catalyzed topics from an OpenCon17 Berlin higher education discussion, remixing them for the K-12 context. Because this virtual conference has no precedent within Canada, the organizers of this inaugural event summarize its planning and execution, and explicate the significance of offering and archiving the presentations as part of the initiative to build a stronger awareness and understanding of K-12 OER current practices. Key words: open educational resources, open pedagogy, online teacher professional development, virtual conference, reflection-on-action Depuis le forum de l’UNESCO en 2002, la sensibilisation quant aux avantages et aux défis liés aux Ressources éducatives libres (REL) dans le contexte des études supérieures fait partie intégrante du mouvement pour l’éducation ouverte. Dans le domaine M-12 par contre, les REL sont moins bien connues, bien qu’il y ait des îlots d’innovateurs en REL partout au Canada et aux États-Unis. L’initiative du département de l’éducation des États-Unis en 2015, #GoOpen, a poussé plus de 20 états américains à se tourner vers l’emploi des REL de la maternelle à la 12e année. Au Canada, certaines provinces ont commencé à se pencher vers les REL pour des raisons financières et pédagogiques. Puisque l’emploi des REL dans un contexte M-12 implique des décisions relatives aux programmes scolaires, de l’enseignant en salle de classe jusqu’à tous les niveaux de gouvernance, la transition vers les REL implique également divers soutiens numériques sophistiqués et complexes à l’échelle du système. Cette transition vers des pratiques émergentes selon lesquelles les enseignants emploient des technologies participatives pour organiser, distribuer et utiliser du contenu pédagogique créé par les élèves exige une sensibilisation quant à ces changements pédagogiques et technologiques. Malgré ces changements imminents, la sensibilisation, l’utilisation et la promotion des REL de la maternelle à la 12e année comme sujet émergent en développement professionnel, il n’existe présentement aucun conseil spécialisé ni aucune organisation professionnelle pour appuyer les enseignants canadiens en M-12 relativement aux REL. Afin de répondre à ce besoin en formation professionnelle, une conférence satellite virtuelle a été offerte au personnel enseignant en service par un réseau appuyé par la Coalition de l’édition savante et des ressources académiques, la Right to Research coalition et la plateforme OpenCon. La conférence virtuelle OpenCon de Athabasca University en 2018 a offert un apprentissage professionnel gratuit sur ces changements touchant la recherche, la création, la concession de licences et le partage de ressources. Par le biais de logiciels de réunions virtuelles, du personnel enseignant M-12 du Canada et ailleurs ont pu apprendre sur les REL, la pédagogie ouverte et l’impact de ces changements sur les pratiques en enseignement et en apprentissage. La conférence virtuelle s’est terminée par le Remix Panel qui a fait la promotion de thèmes abordés lors d’une discussion portant sur les études supérieures à OpenCon17 Berlin tout en les adaptant au contexte M-12. Cette conférence virtuelle n’ayant aucun précédent au Canada, les organisateurs de cet événement inaugural en résument la planification et la mise en œuvre et expliquent la signification d’offrir et d’archiver les présentations dans le cadre de l’initiative visant une meilleure sensibilisation et compréhension des pratiques actuelles impliquant les REL en M-12.

AB  - The scholarly publication model is discussed and the impact of the current technological change on knowledge and communication generally on the scholarly publication model is set out. The proposal is made that rather than open access being the cause of the apparent and impending collapse of the scholarly publication industry, it is but one driver of a far wider change in scholarly publication. That change will have effects that extend well beyond the simple decision of whether a publication should be available by subscription or by one of the forms of open access. A number of other changes to scholarly publication are also itemized. The change is inevitable but its extent is as yet unclear.

AB  - This is the second text in the series collectively written by members of the Editors' Collective, which comprises a series of individual and collaborative reflections upon the experience of contributing to the previous and first text written by the Editors' Collective: 'Towards a Philosophy of Academic Publishing.'In the article, contributors reflect upon their experience of collective writing and summarize the main themes and challenges.They show that the act of collective writing disturbs the existing systems of academic knowledge creation, and link these disturbances to the age of the digital reason.They conclude that the collaborative and collective action is a thing of learning-by-doing, and that collective writing seems to offer a possible way forward from the co-opting of academic activities by economics.Through detaching knowledge creation from economy, collaborative and collective writing address the problem of forming new collective intelligences.

AB  - Ms. Dorothea Salo, Faculty Associate at the School of Library & Information Studies of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argued passionately and cogently about the obligation of librarians to protect the privacy of patrons using electronic serials and the data generated from that usage. Libraries should forcefully express their concerns to vendors of such resources about their collection and commercialization of user data and should stipulate provisions in their contracts and licensing agreements to prevent such misuse of patron’s personal information.

AB  - Objective. The authors study: 1) the level of awareness of librarians of Ukrainian universities about Open Educational Resources (OER); 2) the ability of librarians to provide support services for the development, creation and use of OER in teaching, learning, research. Methods. The study was conducted by methods of analysis of professional literature, online survey (questionnaires) and analysis of the results. The questionnaires “Library of Higher Education Institution in Support of Distance Learning: Open Educational Resources” was distributed from 20.04. until 20.05.2021 among 137 directors of libraries of higher education institutions of Ukraine. Responses came from 77 libraries. The questionnaire consisted of 9 open-ended and closed-ended questions to allow researchers to get a holistic picture of the research process. Results. The analysis of 77 questionnaires showed that the vast majority of free HEI libraries in Ukraine have extensive experience in working with electronic educational resources. Ranking by resource type prove that 95.89% of library collections are the own generation resources (HEI authors): databases, incl. repositories. The concept of "Open Educational Resources" (OERs) is familiar and understandable to 84.42% of respondents. At the same time, 75.32% are already involved in supporting the OER. Librarians may catalog them (21.92%) or not catalog (32.88%). Among the OER types supported by librarians, educational materials (77.05%) and textbooks (55.74%) predominate. The closest partnership of librarians in OER support (except for teachers) is with the specialists of IT services (66.13%). Conclusions. Despite the still spontaneous, chaotic and little-studied nature of the library movement towards OER, librarians are well aware of this issue. At the same time, 96.1% of respondents want to improve their competencies in the direction of supporting open educational resources. This is very important, because it is the understanding and acceptance of OER that is crucial for a long-term vision of this movement. That is why specific aspects, such as organizational, economic, personnel and motivational, need urgent further study.

AB  - SUMMARY The complexity of e-journal subscription management is requiring subscription agents to re-invent themselves to meet new demands. E-journal subscriptions have many more components, including licensing, registration, access, usage statistics, and archiving. By consolidating information and providing one-to-many and many-to-one flows of information, agents can provide efficiencies in operational tasks as well as simplifying the financial transactions. Agents also can add value in negotiations and in aggregating access to e-journals. Agents are making changes in processes such as speeding communications to publishers, partnering with third party content hosting services, and entering into discussions about standards for communication of electronic subscription information. This paper was presented as part of a panel that included presentations by Steve Bosch and Selden Lamoureux.

AB  - In a briefing session entitled 'Working to make online usage statistics more meaningful', Richard Gedye, Chair of COUNTER (Counting Online Usage of Networked Electronic Resources), highlighted the contribution that COUNTER is making to this process. He began by reminding his audience of the benefits that credible, consistent and compatible online usage statistics will bring to both librarians and vendors. This article will describe the philosophy behind the COUNTER Code of Practice, designed to meet the needs of librarians and vendors, and will summarise the latest developments.

AB  - The dissemination of knowledge to other scientists and practitioners in one's field of interest is of critical importance, and the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis has been in the forefront of the dissemination of knowledge for behavior analysts for more than a quarter of a century.Unfortunately, physical access to JABA and other professional journals is difficult for some practitioners and members of the academic community, particularly international professionals (Gnepp, 1981).JABA subscribers span 54 countries other than the United States, and for these subscribers, as well as others who have restricted access to the relevant literature, the responding to requests for reprints continues to be an important avenue for dissemination.In fact, dissemination should be considered ''an ongoing obligation of the authors of scholarly works, part and parcel of the process of disseminating knowledge'' (Thyer, 1994, p. 83).To assess JABA authors' response rate for requests for reprints,

AB  - When, some months ago, Prof. Dekeyser invited me to talk about the tendency to abandon Italian, as well as other European languages, in favour of the English language in the scientific periodicals sector, he obliged me to gather information on a sector different to the one in which I normally work. Indeed, since its beginnings, more than forty years ago, the raison d'être of Casalini Libri, the promotion and diffusion of Italian publications to libraries throughout the world, has always privileged the humanities, social sciences, history and art which reflect the prevalent character of Italian publishing. In order to have a sufficiently reliable picture of the situation, we have contacted a sample group of publishers of scholarly scientific periodicals of various types, obtaining information on the quantity of journals published, the languages used, possible total or partial changes in the choice of language over time, and the utilisation, present or future, of electronic resources. Subdividing the contacted publishers into 4 groups in order to illustrate certain lines of conduct indicates the results of this enquiry [1]. A separate section will then be dedicated to the developments in electronic publishing, with particular regard to the choice of language. The 4 groups are: · Academies · Small specialised scientific publishers · Large specialised scientific publishers · University Presses

AB  - The Anatolian University Libraries Consortium (ANKOS), which was originally established to coordinate university libraries' electronic serials purchases, today plays an active role in selecting, providing access to, managing and evaluating electronic information resources in Turkey.A substantial volume of subscriptions and purchases of e-journal, e-book and e-reference resources is conducted through ANKOS.In order to measure the usage rate of these resources, to conduct cost analyses and to use the findings in strategic planning cycles of both the institutions and the consortium, a New Electronic Resources Management System (ERM) has been developed by ANKOS.In this study, the authors explain how the new system was developed, its technical features, data entry and collection, the system's contribution to the collection of institution and usage statistics, and its impact on strategic planning.Available statistical facts are also provided to illustrate the development and the impact of the new ERM system.

AB  - Crossref envisions “a rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society”. This Research Nexus expands on the importance of research objects being persistently and uniquely identified. The scholarly community has an established practice of connecting things such as citations to others’ work and it is increasingly critical to identify relationships beyond citations, bringing together published work, unpublished work, institutions, individuals, and identifying the actions that they take e.g., funding, publishing, creating, modifying, citing, and sharing. The Research Nexus brings together metadata and relationships to build a joined-up picture of the scholarly ecosystem and helps everyone identify these relationships and how they change through time. This vision is possible if all parts of the scholarly ecosystem (and beyond) work together, including various scholarly infrastructure organizations.

AB  - This paper aims to study the electronic publishing (e-publishing) trends in India, to compare the results with another study conducted in Singapore, and to identify the challenges, opportunities and problem areas faced by the publishing industry in Asia. Findings of the survey show that about one-third (35%) of the Indian and about three-quarters (74%) of the Singaporean publishers are engaged in e-publishing, with a further 20% of Indian publishers likely to start e-publishing in the next three years. A slightly higher percentage of Singaporean respondents over Indian feel that e-publishing has a bright future, but with marketing problems in the region being cited as a barrier to entering into the business. The main reasons for not introducing e-publishing in the Indian publishing houses have been lack of awareness about the new technology on the part of publishers and poor acceptability of epublications among users.

AB  - Social media is a powerful tool. No matter how many followers one has or how many likes any given post receives, every message has an audience. And a post never goes away. Even a deleted post can be captured for posterity via screenshot. Why are the power and longevity of social media so important to consider? It is imperative for each one of us to think about how we want to appear to our social media followers. At work, we are careful to portray ourselves politely and professionally in meetings and emails. During a job interview, we don our best business garb, sit up straight, and talk clearly. Social media should not be any different. As easy as it is to sit behind a keyboard or phone screen and impulsively type a hot take to share with the world, I implore you to consider your voice, tone, and style just like you would if you were sitting in your organization’s conference room to give an important presentation. We all have watched public figures fall quickly from favor after a tasteless post or photo. It only takes one misstep to lose years of hard-earned respect. This article is not intended to discourage you from using social media. By all means, use it, but use it well. Understand that you are not just sharing a private conversation with your best friend. You are sharing your thoughts with a much larger audience. It’s up to you how you use that power, whether you […]

AB  - In this paper the authors analyze the decision-making process at university presses for determining suggested retail prices of books and evaluate the effects of pricing strategies on the financial vitality of the presses. The goal was to test empirically for answers to the following questions: (1) Were university press prices eroded by changes in the economy? (2) Did commercial scholarly presses charge more than university presses for comparable titles? (3) How often did university presses increase backlist prices? (4) Did the emergence of sophisticated online retailing sites create a dynamic sales environment for university press books? Answering these questions required a multifaceted research approach. The authors interviewed university press personnel, collected statistical data on twenty-six distinct book subcategories from university and commercial scholarly presses, and reviewed government data on changes in the economy.

AB  - Text mining is an umbrella term covering a wide range of software tools, including natural language analysis, use of statistical techniques, and machine learning, designed to extract entities (names of people and places), index terms, and relationships. This article outlines these tools, and describes how text mining is being applied in enterprises to solve user problems. A standard measure of accuracy enables text-mining tools to be compared. Text mining is often applied to unstructured content, but the most impressive results come from applying text-mining tools on structured text within a specific subject domain, using an iterative process to train the software.

AB  - Abstract The number of scientific publications nowadays is rapidly increasing, causing information overload for researchers and making it hard for scholars to keep up to date with current trends and lines of work. Recent work has tried to address this problem by developing methods for automated summarization in the scholarly domain, but concentrated so far only on monolingual settings, primarily English. In this paper, we consequently explore how state-of-the-art neural abstract summarization models based on a multilingual encoder–decoder architecture can be used to enable cross-lingual extreme summaries of scholarly texts. To this end, we compile a new abstractive cross-lingual summarization dataset for the scholarly domain in four different languages, which enables us to train and evaluate models that process English papers and generate summaries in German, Italian, Chinese and Japanese. We present our new X-SCITLDR dataset for multilingual summarization and thoroughly benchmark different models based on a state-of-the-art multilingual pre-trained model, including a two-stage pipeline approach that independently summarizes and translates, as well as a direct cross-lingual model. We additionally explore the benefits of intermediate-stage training using English monolingual summarization and machine translation as intermediate tasks and analyze performance in zero- and few-shot scenarios. Finally, we investigate how to make our approach more efficient on the basis of knowledge distillation methods, which make it possible to shrink the size of our models, so as to reduce the computational complexity of the summarization inference.

AB  - The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and its Scholarly Works Application Profile (SWAP) are used to inspire the representation of complex real world situations in the publication part of the Common European Research Information Format (CERIF), the model for Current Research Information Systems (CRIS). CERIF is found to have room for different approaches to representing metadata of scholarly publications, which could hamper the interoperability of CRIS. To lessen that risk, we propose guidelines for representing scholarly publication metadata in CERIF; our design goal is to enhance the utility of CRIS in supporting the functions of scientific communication. The guidelines are formulated using the notions of Scholarly Work, Expression and Manifestation from FRBR/SWAP.

AB  - Since Research Ideas and Outcomes was launched in late 2015, it has stimulated experimentation around the publication of and engagement with research processes, especially those with a strong open science component. Here, we zoom in on the first 300 RIO articles that have been published and elucidate how they relate to the different stages and variants of the research cycle, how they help address societal challenges and what forms of engagement have evolved around these resources, most of which have a nature and scope that would prevent them from entering the scholarly record via more traditional journals. Building on these observations, we describe some changes we recently introduced in the policies and peer review process at RIO to further facilitate engagement with the research process, including the establishment of an article collections feature that allows us to bring together research ideas and outcomes from within one research cycle or across multiple ones, irrespective of where they have been published.

AB  - The increasing governmentalization and commodification of knowledge are putting intense pressure on scholars to write and publish more, and in accordance with conventions that are not of their own making, due to benchmarks of success set by the applied sciences that suit business and the state. These tendencies are also producing a potentially unsustainable environmental burden that may be increasing, not decreasing, as we move more and more into an online publishing world. This recognition leads to three provocations: 1) There is too much scholarly publication to keep up with, and too much pressure to publish; 2) The future of all academic publishing will largely be determined by the sciences; and 3) We must consider the relative merits of publishing electronically rather than on paper in terms of the environment - in other words, asking “how green is this paper?”

AB  - In this study, I explore the practice of Sci-Hub using some concepts derived from the Brazilian philosopher Paulo Freire and the Canadian philosopher Henry Giroux.These are the concepts of culture of silence, language of critique, culture of resistance and language of hope.In general, the world of education silently and passively accepts a regime perpetrated by giant publishing corporations.The practice of Sci-Hub mirrors a critique of a form of oppression and domination of consciousness -that a sensible rationality, discourse, and regime is one which is advocated by big corporations.I affirm that Sci-Hub is a creative response to a culture of silence effectively perpetuated by the regime of intellectual property, publishing industry and corporatization of the school.But at the same time, the practice of Sci-Hub manifests a clinging to the language of hope that resists the ideology of "There Is No Alternative" (TINA).Despite the inherent difficulties in the contemporary society, the practice of Sci Hub persists to look for small spaces to offer effective alternatives to the present order or lack of it.

AB  - Adopting digital materials such as eTextbooks and e-coursepacks is a potential strategy to address textbook affordability in the United States. However, university business relationships with bookstore vendors implicitly structure which instructional resources are available and in what manner. In this study, a document analysis was conducted on the bookstore contracts for the universities included in the State University System of Florida. Namely, issues of textbook affordability, digital material terminology and seller exclusivity were investigated. It was found that textbook affordability was generally conceived in terms of print rental textbooks and buyback programs, and that eTextbooks were priced higher than print textbooks (25% to 30% markup). Implications and recommendations for change are shared.DOI: 10.18870/hlrc.v5i4.284

Library &amp; Information Science Research, 39(1), 8-15. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2017.01.002 Abstract Objective – To compare the characteristics of authors publishing in open access and non-open access library and information science (LIS) journals. Design – Comparative analysis of published journal articles. Setting – Academic journals. Subjects – Articles published in selected LIS journals between 2008-2013. Methods – Journals included in the Library Science and Information Science category in the 2012 edition of Journal Citation Reports and those listed in the Library and Information Science category of the Directory of Open Access Journals as of May 2013 were included in the analysis. Articles were examined and coded for author occupation, academic rank, and type of collaboration. Main Results – The author analyzed 1,807 articles from 20 open access journals and 1,665 articles from 13 non-open access journals. An unknown number of articles were excluded because they lacked required author information. Over half (53.9%) of the authors who published in the open access journals were practitioners. Over half (58.1%) of the authors who published in the non-open access journals were academics. Librarian-librarian collaboration was the most common type (38.6%) of collaboration found in the open access journals. Academic-academic collaboration was the most common type (34.1%) of collaboration found in the non-open access journals. Collaboration between librarians and academics was seen in 20.5% of open access articles and 13.2% of non-open access articles. Conclusion – In general, librarian-authored research was found more often in open access journals, while the “latest research topics and ideas” (p. 14) were found most often in non-open access journals.

AB  - Enabling and supporting discoverability of research outputs and datasets are key functions of university and academic health center institutional repositories. Yet adoption rates among potential repository users are hampered by a number of factors, prominent among which are difficulties with basic usability. In their efforts to implement a local instance of InvenioRDM, a turnkey next generation repository, team members at Northwestern University’s Galter Health Sciences Library &amp; Learning Center supplemented agile development principles and methods and a user experience design-centered approach with observations of users’ microinteractions (interactions with each part of the software’s interface that requires human intervention). Microinteractions were observed through user testing sessions conducted in Fall 2019. The result has been a more user-informed development effort incorporating the experiences and viewpoints of a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning multiple departments of a highly ranked research university.

AB  - The study investigates the awareness, practices and attitudes of researchers in regard to open data – i.e. the sharing and reuse of research data – which is part of a larger study that concentrated on the scholarly communication readiness of Malaysian researchers in Open Science. The data were gathered by means of a survey which obtained 135 responses from researchers based in five research universities in Malaysia. The main conclusions are: (a) the researchers are aware of open data, yet, they are not practising it as shown in the mean scores, as well as in their responses towards the statements asked; (b) unclear information on data privacy policy, misuse of data, and the fear of losing publication opportunity are part of disincentives for data sharing. The requisite for open data understanding, practices and attitudinal change is needed for these may impact research practices, government policies and scientific knowledge, leading to research transparency and accountability, social benefit and economic growth. This paper concludes with a discussion that policies incentivizing the sharing and reuse of open data, as well as tools and guidance to support data sharing, and a strong incentives and rewards to implement open data among researchers, should be encouraged. Future studies should look into the importance of rewards for data sharing among researchers’ institutions. Studies bridging the gap between policy and practices of open data should be examined, if true openness in research is to be established in Malaysia.

AB  - Since its advent more than 15 years ago, the knowledgebase has quietly deposed the catalog as the center of the library management and discovery universe. Knowledgebases provide libraries with an inventory of their e-resources holdings and describe the materials that a library has purchased at a more granular level than the traditional bibliographic record. Knowledgebases power key tools such as link resolvers and unified search platforms, support management needs across the e-resources lifecycle, and more recently have evolved to intersect with areas such as linked open data, community contribution models, and next-generation library management platforms. They have truly become the hub from which our most vital services operate. This report will provide an overview of “The Knowledgebase at the Center of the Universe,” an American Library Association Technology Report assessing the state of knowledgebase technology. Topics covered will include an overview of the current product landscape, an exploration of new directions, and case studies from libraries and vendors using knowledgebases in innovative ways.

AB  - Introdução: Atualmente diversos campos conduzem pesquisas sobre o domínio “gênero”. Este estudo investiga sob quais perspectivas este domínio é abordado pela Ciência da Informação (CI). Objetivo: O objetivo é identificar como o campo se apropria e/ou contribui para os estudos sobre gênero; tendo como norteadora a acepção de que gênero é um termo relacionado aos papéis sociais e expectativas de comportamento atribuídas as pessoas em função do seu sexo. Metodologia: Foi realizada coleta e análise das palavras-chave de 588 artigos indexados na Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA), entre 1980 e 2016. Considerando o grande número de palavras-chave recuperadas, foi gerada uma nuvem de tags; permitindo a identificação dos termos mais utilizados por década. Resultados: Os resultados indicam que o domínio “gênero” foi abordado pela CI sob diferentes perspectivas ao longo dos anos, mas mantendo, de maneira geral, o foco principal em questões relacionadas a estudos sobre mulheres e diferenças de gênero. Observa-se também que o domínio é tratado pela CI principalmente dentro de tópicos tradicionais da área, como Recuperação da Informação e Comunicação Científica. Conclusões: Ressalta-se que o panorama resultante deste estudo abre novas possibilidades de investigação sobre como a CI aborda o domínio “gênero” em suas pesquisas científicas.

AB  - In August 2017, NASIG approved and adopted a set of core competencies that can serve as a roadmap for a new Scholarly Communication Librarian working to promote and build collections for a new campus Institutional Repository. This presentation addressed how to utilize the specific competencies to scaffold priorities when building a new repository, including developing campus partnerships with administration, colleges, departments, faculty, and students. The Core Competencies can also be used to develop effective short- and long-term goals, both for the librarian and for the Institutional Repository, and can provide communication and outreach strategies to share those goals to the campus community.

AB  - Since 2009, Open Access (OA) Week has been celebrated worldwide in October each year. It is an opportunity for librarians to engage with the research community and demonstrate the value that they bring to their organisations in the area of disseminating scholarly output. Although thousands of events have been held since the inception of OA Week, a minimal amount of research has been carried out regarding the impact of these events. This article presents a review of the literature on OA Week and evaluates the effectiveness of three events held during OA Week 2015 in Ireland through the use of statistics and a survey. The three events held during OA Week 2015 in Ireland that were evaluated include: a seminar run by Repository Network Ireland (RNI), a D.E.A.R. (Drop Everything And Read) campaign using OA materials organized by Dr. Steevens' Library, and a collaborative OA seminar between Dr. Steevens' Library and Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) libraries. The author concludes that a collaborative approach to planning and managing OA week between librarians from academic and other sectors can have tangible benefits both in terms of promoting OA and also promoting the role of the Librarian in the OA movement.

AB  - One of the most important tasks in scientific publishing is the articles' evaluation via the editorial board and the reviewers' community. Additionally, in scientific publishing great concern exists regarding the peer-review process and how it can be further optimised to decrease the time from submission to the first decision, as well as increase the objectivity of the reviewers' remarks ensuring that no bias or human error exists in the reviewing process. In order to address this issue, our article suggests a novice cloud framework for manuscript submission based on blockchain technology that further enhances the anonymity between authors and reviewers alike. Our method covers the whole spectrum of current submission systems capabilities, but it also provides a decentralised solution using open-source tools such as Java Spring that enhance the anonymity of the reviewing process.

AB  - As research datasets and analyses grow in complexity, data that could be valuable to other researchers and to support the integrity of published work remain uncurated across disciplines. These data are especially concentrated in the Long Tail of funded research, where curation resources and related expertise are often inaccessible. In the domain of astronomy, it is undisputed that uncurated dark data exist, but the scope of the problem remains uncertain. The Astrolabe Project is a collaboration between University of Arizona researchers, the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure environment, and American Astronomical Society, with a mission to identify and ingest previously-uncurated astronomical data, and to provide a robust computational environment for analysis and sharing of data, as well as services for authors wishing to deposit data associated with publications. Following expert feedback obtained through two workshops held in 2015 and 2016, Astrolabe is funded in part by National Science Foundation. The system is being actively developed within CyVerse, and Astrolabe collaborators are soliciting heterogeneous datasets and potential users for the prototype system. Astrolabe team members are currently working to characterize the properties of uncurated astronomical data, and to develop automated methods for locating potentially-useful data to be targeted for ingest into Astrolabe, while cultivating a user community for the new data management system.

AB  - The DCC Curation Lifecycle Model has played a vital role in the field of data curation for over a decade. During that time, the scale and complexity of data have changed dramatically, along with the contexts of data production and use. This paper reports on a study examining factors impacting data curation practices and presents recommendations for updating the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model. The study was grounded in a review of other lifecycle models and informed by a site visit to the Digital Curation Centre and consultation with expert practitioners and researchers. Framed by contemporary conditions impacting the conduct of research and provision of data services, the analysis and proposed recommendations account for the prominence of machine-actionable data, the importance of machine learning for data processing and analytics, growth of integrated research workflows, and escalating concerns with fairness, accountability, and transparency of data and algorithms.

AB  - Background: The two main bibliometric databases, namely Web of Science and Scopus, are not available for free, whereas the Dimensions is one of the new freely available bibliometric databases and is considered to be an alternative to Scopus in particular. Objectives: To compare the information on citations to articles published in European Science Editing as available in the Dimensions to that available in Scopus. Methods: Information on articles published in European Science Editing that were cited in sources published between 2020 and 2022 was analysed to compare the relevant data as given by Dimensions and Scopus. Results: Both databases were similar in terms of the number of cited articles, the number of citing articles, and the number of citations. Of the total of 35 cited articles, 3 were unique to each of the 2 databases. Of the total of 93 citing articles, 74 were found in Scopus and 75 in the Dimensions. Conclusions: Scopus and Dimensions shared an overlap of 84% in articles cited but of only 60% in the citing articles. Information on individual citing articles strongly suggests that Dimensions takes data on citing articles from CrossRef. Unfortunately, these metadata contain errors. Data on citations in the Dimension database could be made more accurate if the references appended to the citing articles listed in the Crossref database were under an open license.

AB  - This paper describes our submission for the LongSumm task in SDP 2021. We propose a method for incorporating sentence embeddings produced by deep language models into extractive summarization techniques based on graph centrality in an unsupervised manner.The proposed method is simple, fast, can summarize any kind of document of any size and can satisfy any length constraints for the summaries produced. The method offers competitive performance to more sophisticated supervised methods and can serve as a proxy for abstractive summarization techniques

AB  - 機械可読性とはコンピューターによる文書構造の認識しやすさである。機械可読性に配慮した文書はより検索されやすく，利用されやすくなる。逆に，機械可読性を考慮しない文書は流通しにくい。今まで，文書は人間可読性を高めることに重点が置かれてきたが，文書流通がインターネットを中心とするようになり，XMLを利用した機械可読性を高めた文書の重要性が増してきている。しかし機械可読性と人間可読性は往々にして対立する。本稿では，これらの対立の事例を検討し，オンラインジャーナルでは当面機械可読性優位の組版が行われるべきであることを示す。

AB  - SUMMARY Librarians and publishers alike are struggling with a plethora of new options for pricing journals. To build a shared understanding of the advantages and concerns of various common pricing models, three categories of pricing models are evaluated in paper. Variations on traditional subscriptions, tiered pricing, and consortial complexities are defined and then considered from the viewpoint of both librarians and publishers. Some common themes in the discussions are identified and considered.

AB  - Key points Our collective authorship and publishing practices do not always end up ensuring that scholarly content is discoverable by readers. Readers of all kinds rely on a variety of ‘discovery pathways’, such as search engines, library systems, and various electronic links, some of which are blind to the content they desire. Efforts over the years to improve content discoverability have made great progress, but an increasing amount of freely available content brings up new issues. The National Information Standards Organization (NISO)’s Discovery to Delivery (D2D) Topic Committee has developed a grid comparing various ways in which content is shared with various ways in which users discover such content. This article brings to light a few of the current obstacles and opportunities for innovation by publishers, aggregators, search engines, and library systems, and invites Learned Publishing readers to step up and identify others.

AB  - World‐wide calls for improvements in access to journal literature are being answered by a plethora of projects and services. Consortial purchasing, national licences and “big deals” dominate changes in collection development. Moves to set up affordable easy‐to‐use electronic document delivery services offer an alternative model based on single‐article purchase. More radical barrier‐free access models are moving the economic emphasis away from purchasing to input‐payments. Are all these projects and services making a difference or will access to journal literature be no better in years to come than it is now? It is arguable that only those initiatives which are developing new models through collaboration between the stakeholders will succeed in making a major breakthrough in access.

AB  - Key points The term 'serial' is becoming obsolete largely because what was once a dominant paper-based medium for communicating has been replaced by a complex ecosystem of online information sources, social media, digital subscription packages, databases, and emerging new formats. While the term serial, associated with publishing in neat instalments, may be fading, the notion of serializing remains very hot. For many users, the 'serial' -or what is left of it -persists only as a Cheshire Cat smile, a mystifying element that must be included as part of the student's properly structured citation. Although seriality is still a valid concept, in the technical environment, there are hints that 'serial' might be replaced by new phrases that include the term 'diachronic'.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to look at the changing way in which the Information Services Office (ISO) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides services to NIST scientific and technical staff throughout their research and publishing cycles. These services include the more traditional services of a research library and publishing NIST technical reports and The Journal of Research of NIST and preserving and exhibiting scientific instruments and other artifacts. ISO has always prided itself on having a close relationship with its customers, providing a high level of service and developing new services to stay in front of NIST researcher needs. Through a concerted, strategic effort since the late 1990s, ISO has developed and promoted relationships with its key customers through its Lab Liaison Program. Design/methodology/approach This paper discusses the relationship ISO has developed with the Office of Data and Informatics (ODI), how this relationship was forged and how this collaboration will serve as a model for working with the other labs and programs at NIST. It will also discuss the risks and opportunities of this new collaborative service model, how ISO positioned itself to become an equal partner with ODI in the exploration of solutions to data management issues and the benefits of the relationship from ODI’s perspective. Findings A pattern of strategic changes to the services and activities offered by the Lab Liaison program has put ISO in the position to collaborate as peers with researchers at NIST. Originality/value This study provides an overview of how ISO made strategic decisions to incorporate non-traditional services to support data management at NIST.

AB  - In 2020 the University of Kansas Libraries began a year-long diversity audit of the circulating monograph collection. The study, which utilized the checklist method evaluated the Libraries' holdings based on a curated list of award winning and nominated titles. In addition to determining if specific titles were part of the collection, the study also sought to learn how these books were acquired. The study found that the library owned 60% of the 6,671 titles checked and of those with a known acquisitions method, 59% came via an approval plan. Titles and publishers not profiled by GOBI were significantly less likely to be in the collection as they were not included in the approval plan or highlighted by a slip notification. The Libraries' reliance on GOBI and efficient and streamlined selection and acquisition processes has resulted in a less diverse collection.

AB  - Is it possible to predict the future of serials work? Not with perfect accuracy, of course - but to do so imperfectly is both possible and imperative.We need to be looking ahead and asking questions like these: What are the implications of the open access movement for serials staff? Will the information economy of the future be driven by problems of scarcity or problems of abundance, and what does each scenario mean for the library? The areas in which we work are especially volatile, and both we and those we serve will benefit greatly if we learn how to anticipate and prepare for change, rather than simply reacting to it after it happens.

VL  - 9
AB  - OpenBiodiv is a biodiversity knowledge graph containing a synthetic linked open dataset, OpenBiodiv-LOD, which combines knowledge extracted from academic literature with the taxonomic backbone used by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The linked open data is modelled according to the OpenBiodiv-O ontology integrating semantic resource types from recognised biodiversity and publishing ontologies with OpenBiodiv-O resource types, introduced to capture the semantics of resources not modelled before.We introduce the new release of the OpenBiodiv-LOD attained through information extraction and modelling of additional biodiversity entities. It was achieved by further developments to OpenBiodiv-O, the data storage infrastructure and the workflow and accompanying R software packages used for transformation of academic literature into Resource Description Framework (RDF). We discuss how to utilise the LOD in biodiversity informatics and give examples by providing solutions to several competency questions. We investigate performance issues that arise due to the large amount of inferred statements in the graph and conclude that OWL-full inference is impractical for the project and that unnecessary inference should be avoided.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, the research of statistical methods to analyze complex structures of data has increased. In particular, a lot of attention has been focused on the interval-valued data. In a classical cluster analysis framework, an interesting line of research has focused on the clustering of interval-valued data based on fuzzy approaches. Following the partitioning around medoids fuzzy approach research line, a new fuzzy clustering model for interval-valued data is suggested. In particular, we propose a new model based on the use of the entropy as a regularization function in the fuzzy clustering criterion. The model uses a robust weighted dissimilarity measure to smooth noisy data and weigh the center and radius components of the interval-valued data, respectively. To show the good performances of the proposed clustering model, we provide a simulation study and an application to the clustering of scientific journals in research evaluation.

AB  - Education is a major force for economic and social wellbeing. Despite high aspirations, education at all levels can be expensive and ineffective. Three Grand Challenges are identified: (1) enable people to learn orders of magnitude more effectively, (2) enable people to learn at orders of magnitude less cost, and (3) demonstrate success by exemplary interdisciplinary education in complex systems science. A ten year ‘man-on-the-moon’ project is proposed in which FuturICT’s unique combination of Complexity, Social and Computing Sciences could provide an urgently needed transdisciplinary language for making sense of educational systems. In close dialogue with educational theory and practice, and grounded in the emerging data science and learning analytics paradigms, this will translate into practical tools (both analytical and computational) for researchers, practitioners and leaders; generative principles for resilient educational ecosystems; and innovation for radically scalable, yet personalised, learner engagement and assessment. The proposed Education Accelerator will serve as a ‘wind tunnel’ for testing these ideas in the context of real educational programmes, with an international virtual campus delivering complex systems education exploiting the new understanding of complex, social, computationally enhanced organisational structure developed within FuturICT.

AB  - &lt;img src=” https://s3.amazonaws.com/production.scholastica/article/34241/large/res_articles.jpeg?1649278121”&gt; Science publishing has many problems today. Some of them are caused by external factors, such as the computer and internet revolution. Others are because of the publication explosion and the resulting imbalance between the interests of science, authors, institutions, and the publishing business. However, these pains are part of the overall growth, nothing more. Society needs science more than ever, but progress cannot be made without reliable communication in publications. Publications are not science; they are yesterday’s information and knowledge, which are organized, stored, and shared on various media. It is important to understand actual problems with publications and consider what you can do.

AB  - The web began with a vision of, as stated by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, "that much academic information should be freely available to anyone". For many years, the development of the web and the development of digital libraries and other scholarly communications infrastructure proceeded in tandem. A milestone occurred in July, 1995, when the first issue of D-Lib Magazine was published as an online, HTML-only, open access magazine, serving as the focal point for the then emerging digital library research community. In 2017 it ceased publication, in part due to the maturity of the community it served as well as the increasing availability of and competition from eprints, institutional repositories, conferences, social media, and online journals - the very ecosystem that D-Lib Magazine nurtured and enabled. As long-time members of the digital library community and frequent contributors to D-Lib Magazine, we reflect on the many innovations that D-Lib Magazine pioneered and were made possible by the web, including: open access, HTML-only publication and embracing the hypermedia opportunities afforded by HTML, persistent identifiers and stable URLs, rapid publication, and community engagement. Although it ceased publication after 22 years and 265 issues, it remains unchanged on the live web and still provides a benchmark for academic serials and web-based publishing.

AB  - Open access to scholarly resources is a growing dimension in the universe of scholarly communication. The impact of open access on the traditional model of acquisition and access is just beginning to surface. In managing the transitioning toward open access, libraries will benefit from the model of use analytics developed by the collection development team at HKU to rationalize the value of library investment and to refine collection priorities for the future development of the collections and budget. This paper will discuss the collection building strategies of my university to tackle the major challenges in managing the transition to open access model. In particular, I will focus on the analytics employed to evaluate the use and cost impact of e‐journal big deals within an open access environment. The shift to open access of scholarly contents, which is a critical component in the research process, must be prudently managed in keeping down the total costs of ownership. The cost impact of open access must be factored into the big picture in developing new pricing models for greater optimization of resources and budget.

AB  - Outlines the nature of research and publishing in Arabic, the attempts to encourage resource sharing in the Arab Gulf States, the existing arrangements for interlibrary lending and the development of electronic document delivery systems that facilitate interlibrary lending. A case study examined the availability of relevant technology and personnel with appropriate expertise in three major libraries in Kuwait: Kuwait University, the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training, and the National Scientific and Technical Information Center. Questionnaires and interviews, intended to assess staff attitudes and perceptions, were used to examine the reasons why the Ariel system of Electronic Document Delivery appeared to have not yet been adopted, although it has been increasingly used in other parts of the world for more than 10 years. The paper notes that the adoption of this new technology in Kuwait is supported in principle, but is hindered by lack of awareness, skills and motivation, and speculates about the wider implications for the Gulf States.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationships between income inequality, economic growth and the main macroeconomic factors in Tunisia. We investigate two effects: the effect of inequality on growth, and particularly, the effect of growth on inequality. Also, attention has been focused on the role of the monetary policy, via introducing money supply as an independent variable, in affecting inequality and growth. Our empirical study is based on a series of annual data from 1975 to 2015 using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) method in order to estimate the cointegrating equations. The findings of the paper show that income inequality increase economic growth in Tunisia. Other factors having significant positive effect on economic growth include money supply and life expectancy at birth. However, inflation rate, primary education and unemployment have statistically significant and negative effect on economic growth. On the other hand, the results indicate that money supply, inflation rate, unemployment and savings are positively and significantly related to income inequality, whereas, life expectancy at birth and gross fixed capital formation decrease inequality in Tunisia. The policy implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - The UK Research and Innovation funding council announced its latest Open Access Policy on August 6, 2021. This policy applies to all UKRI funded research, and thus constitutes a significant move towards OA as an academic standard. For the first time in the UK, OA is to be mandated for academic books – this means that both monographs and edited chaptered books must be published Open Access from January 2024, though a 1 year embargo is permissible. As the infrastructures, business models and workflows supporting OA book publishing are currently lagging behind journals, especially in the Arts and Humanities, many researchers and institutions have responded to the policy with some consternation, even whilst supporting the aims and ethics of OA publishing. This article explores some of these apprehensions and questions raised by institutions, academics and by librarians regarding OA book publishing in a UK context, especially regarding funding and sustainability. It aims to dispel certain myths around OA book publishing in general, particularly the notion that Book Processing Charges are a necessary or even desirable element. The article then presents some of the varied models and systems currently in use and development, particularly the work of the UKRI/Research England funded COPIM project (Community- Led Open Access Infrastructures for Monographs), one of the aims of which is to build ways of delivering more sustainable revenue sources to OA publishers. It focuses in particular a key and soon to be launched output of the project: the Open Book Collective.

AB  - The extent to which data visualizations are used, and the quality of these visualizations, has consistently been shown to influence human decision-making relative to static (non-visual) presentations of findings or ideas (Boldosova &amp; Luoto, 2019; El-Wakeel et al., 2020; Liem et al., 2020). Why are visualizations so impactful? Likely because most decision-makers do not want to sort through spreadsheets or read a novel-length narrative to understand what is important—they want it straight and quick. They want color, novelty, storytelling, and interactivity (Dykes, 2020; Kostelnick, 2016; Kosara &amp; MacKinley, 2013). This is the purpose of data storytelling: to literally tell a story about the data analyses to, in some way, impart knowledge or affect change among the audience. Data and data analysis are never neutral—they are always political–and storytelling is how the data analyst can attempt to influence how data findings are perceived by the audience. This paper discusses the basis of data storytelling and why it is important for creating a narrative around data visualizations that compels readers and viewers to act upon findings. It then discusses (in the form of a reflective discussion) how the art of data storytelling may be improved and activated to promote social justice themes by reflecting on the effectiveness of storytelling in hip hop music.

AB  - Depuis 25 ans, le mouvement open access se déploie progressivement au croisement de revendications pour une circulation plus ouverte des résultats de la recherche et d'opportunités inédites introduites par l'Internet et le Web. Les reformulations du mouvement furent nombreuses, portées par des acteurs différents, ne projetant pas les mêmes enjeux sur cette transformation. À l'appui d'une observation participante, l'article s'attache à retracer l'évolution des différentes modalités opératoires de l'open access à la fois dans une dimension diachronique et une dimension comparée pour les politiques nationales de différents pays. Un tournant particulier semble s'amorcer, marqué par des négociations globales entre éditeurs, pouvoirs publics et financeurs de la recherche. Le contexte français est analysé, en particulier par l'intégration récente d'éléments réglementaires dans la loi Lemaire de 2016 et par les tensions croissantes avec les acteurs de l'édition nationale, majoritairement en sciences humaines et sociales.

An historic view of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the funder’s mandates, and other policy formations set the stage for the discussion of the role of the library in this institutional challenge. In his new role at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Plutchak operates at The Edge of Chaos, with “data wranglers”— concerned parties from a variety of disciplines who all have an interest in data management and who come together to share ideas and move closer to an innovative solution.

AB  - In Europe we tend to think of cultural diversity as the very essence of our European fabric. This conference has also underlined the necessity for sticking to internationally recognised standards if we want a seamless cooperation in the future. So I believe that presenting the Danish situation to you serves a dual purpose: that of confirming that basically we do the things you do, but we also do some things in a different way which hopefully might be inspiring. I shall be looking at both aspects, with the main emphasis on the Danish models.

AB  - ABSTRACT Copyright law grants exclusive rights to authors of original works of authorship, but those rights are subject to numerous exceptions and limitations, including fair use in the United States and fair dealing in Canada. These exceptions have traditionally worked to ensure that the rights of copyright owners are adequately balanced with the interests of subsequent authors, researchers, and consumers of copyrighted works. Moreover, fair use has emerged as the most promising legal mechanism for the digitization, preservation, and study of large collections of copyrighted work. Fair use and fair dealing provide much of the flexibility needed to ensure that copyright protection serves to facilitate scholarship rather than threaten it. Scholars encounter copyright law both as authors and as users of copyrighted works. With an eye toward the future, this panel will examine the extent to which the discourses and practices of the past decade have contributed to shaping and reshaping our scholarly environment, how the information field has responded, and why and how information scholars, researchers and professionals ought to remain engaged in these matters in the future.

AB  - This essay comprises four parts, each by one of the co-bloggers at In the Middle (http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com). Karl Steel argues that the benefits of academic blogging outweigh its potential humiliations, and that academic conferences should post their papers publicly and allow for comments so that conferences, in a sense, never end. Graduate students and junior scholars should be encouraged to blog to help build a community and a trade in ideas, and to accustom them to the feelings of exposure and humiliation common to all writing, which will thereby train them to become more confident scholars. Jeffrey Jerome Cohen examines some of the difficulties posed by the age of e-medieval: an internet culture of negativity. Blogging entails finding strategies for managing harsh or off topic comments, as well as for coping with unwanted attention. Drawing on the pedagogical distinction Nancy Sommers makes between process and product, Mary Kate Hurley examines the role blogs might play in creating a communal space in which to share unfinished ideas. Blogs might be an ideal medium for the process of thinking, rather than the finished work of having had thought. Eileen A. Joy argues there may be more value in thinking and “working through” our scholarship online, in an “open” environment that promotes and invites democratic, catholic, and convivial support, as well as the accidental tourist and silent voyuer, than there is in the traditional “finished product” of a journal article or book. It pleads, further, for a better awareness of the fact that intellectual property is always co-extensive and communal.

AB  - The descriptive concepts of “semantic” taxonomies are assigned to content items of the publishing domain for supporting a plethora of operations, mostly regarding the organization and discoverability of the content, as well as for recommendation tasks. However, either not all publishers rely on such structures, or in many cases employ their own proprietary taxonomies, thus the content is either difficult to be retrieved by the end users or stored in publisher-specific fragmented “data-silos”, respectively. To address these issues, the modular and scalable “Dominance Metric” methodology is proposed for rating the dominance and importance of concepts in semantic taxonomies. Our proposed metric is applied both on the vast multidisciplinary Microsoft Academic Graph Fields of Study taxonomy and the MeSH controlled vocabulary in order for their enhanced and refined versions to be produced. Moreover, we describe the cleansing process of the resulting taxonomy from Microsoft’s structure by deduplicating concepts and refining the hierarchical relations towards the increase of its representation quality. Our evaluation procedure provided valuable insights by showcasing that high volume, namely the number of publications a concept is assigned to, does not necessarily imply high influence, but the latter is also affected by the structural and topological properties of the individual entities.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an opportunity for academic libraries to advance open access (OA) to scholarly articles. Awareness among faculty on the importance of OA has increased significantly during the pandemic, as colleges and universities struggle financially and seek sustainable access to high-quality scholarly journals. Consortia have played an important role in establishing negotiation principles on OA journal agreements. While the number of OA agreements is increasing, case studies involving individual libraries are still limited. This paper reviews existing literature on publisher negotiation principles related to OA journal negotiations and reflects on recent cases at an academic library in Pennsylvania, in order to identify best practices in OA journal negotiations. It provides recommendations on roles, relationships, and processes, as well as essential terms of OA journal agreements. This study’s findings are most relevant to large academic libraries that are interested in negotiating with scholarly journal publishers independently or through consortia.

AB  - Abstracts are essential components of academic research articles, providing a concise summary of the study's purpose, methods, results, and conclusions. This qualitative evidence synthesis examines the quality, structure, and content of abstracts in the fields of English Language Teaching (ELT) and Literature. A systematic search of relevant databases identified 15 peer-reviewed articles published in English with a focus on abstract writing. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the studies for their research findings, methodologies, and recommendations related to abstract writing. The findings reveal that abstracts tend to be descriptive, with a focus on presenting the research problem, methodology, and main findings. However, there is a lack of consistency in structure and content across journals, and the quality of abstracts varies widely. Based on the analysis, several key recommendations for improving abstract writing in ELT and Literature journals are proposed, including greater consistency and standardization across journals, and improved training for authors and reviewers. This qualitative evidence synthesis offers a thorough overview of the body of knowledge on the subject of writing effective abstracts for ELT and literature journals and makes suggestions for further study and practice in this field. The study highlights the need for greater attention to abstract writing quality, structure, and content, and provides practical recommendations for improving the quality of abstracts in ELT and Literature research articles using thematic analysis as a data analysis technique.

AB  - We wanted to rethink how our library supported open access, so we attempted to ask ourselves and our staff why they supported “open” and how they defined “open”. By unpacking our institutional and individual understandings of “open” using design thinking principles, we were able to not only create a strong and value-driven statement, but to also open the door for staff at all levels to engage in policy-making for the organization.

AB  - Paper journals, conferences and workshops have been the major media for scholarly discourse for 300 years. However, in the 1990s access to low-cost personal computing and Internet communications is leading to radical changes in the operation of scholarly communities. Electronic publication and conferencing is becoming common in all disciplines using commonly available Internet facilities such as ftp archives, list servers, gopher and world-wide web. Some scholarly communities that had not previously achieved a critical mass have done so through the net, others have launched major collaborative projects managed through the net, and others are questioning the value of conventional conferences that are limited by being localized in space and time compared with the flexibility of continuous international electronic conferencing through the web. However, the majority of current electronic scholarly discourse emulates paper-based media in relying primarily on text and diagrams for knowledge communication. It is beginning to take advantage of some of the multimedia capabilities of electronic publishing for color diagrams, pictures, movies and sound. Hypertext and hypermedia capabilities are being used to develop webs of linked material. Concept maps and formal knowledge structures are being used to provide a framework for knowledge expression, interchange and collaborative development. This article focuses on the extension of current documentation technologies to provide knowledge-level support for scholarly communities.

AB  - This article describes two serialists who use skills honed in their respective serials departments to show how those skills adapt to the world of e-publishing. The presenters discussed their roles in e-publishing and their respective university presses and library publishing programs. How have their libraries reorganized to provide resources for supporting these new roles? The daily work of an e-publishing librarian was reviewed, including an overview of working with Digital Commons and Open Journal Systems, two e-press platforms. The presenters also discussed funding and sustainability of the programs, and working with open access and subscription titles.

AB  - Abstract This study delves into artificial intelligence (AI) literacy within Zambian academic libraries, focusing on librarians’ perceptions and applications of AI. The research aims to gauge the AI literacy level among Library and Information Science Professionals in Zambia, identify their awareness and knowledge of AI applications in libraries, and explore their perceptions regarding the advantages and challenges of implementing AI technologies in library services. Data from 82 diverse participants were gathered using purposive and convenience sampling methods. The findings indicate a solid understanding of AI fundamentals among Zambian librarians and positive attitudes towards AI’s potential benefits in library services. However, challenges such as the need for enhanced AI expertise, resistance to change, and budgetary constraints are acknowledged.

AB  - Recognizing the paucity of quantitative and qualitative data from North American educational institutions that have pursued open access policies, the authors devised a survey to collect information on the characteristics of these institutions, as well as the elements of the open access policies, the methods of promoting these policies, faculty concerns about the policies, and how those concerns have been addressed. The data collected through survey results from fifty-one institutions can inform the strategic decisions being made by other institutions considering an open access policy and illustrates the essential roles that academic libraries can play in the development and passage of open access policies.

AB  - The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) is building on its long experience in distance education to design for the delivery of a comprehensive range of teaching, learning and support services in a web environment The author is a university librarian who has also taken on the role of directing the corporate project that is developing USQ's vision of the eUniversity. From the perspective of this project, she discusses the challenges for librarians of integrating with other functions to meet the needs of students studying ‘flexibly’. What is the role of the library for an online student who may only know the university as a web site? What will be the expectations of those students, formed by familiarity with commercial applications on the web, and can they be met without lowering academic standards? The article discusses some of the implications—legal, pedagogical, technical—of working in a web environment to deliver learning flexibly.

AB  - E-libraries just like the former paper-based libraries will become increasingly essential and indispensable tools in research and education. Library consortia seem to be the way to get e-libraries started all over the world. However, it is unclear yet whether this is going to be a longlasting workable model. The Belgian research libraries follow the international pattern and are rapidly becoming hybrid libraries especially in business, science, applied sciences and biomedicine (the STM disciplines). Still they have large paper bound collections on board and no library is willing to replace these in the near future by a purely electronic collection of journals. The fear of losing the content and thus the „raison d’être“ of the library and the concern for users not yet familiar with e-information sources are the cornerstone for a prudent, yet conservative policy. Increasingly e-information and e-journals are being taken on board. Paper and electronic go side by side in new hybrid libraries partly also due to the market policy set by the publishers in combining paper and electronic in an attempt to keep or improve the annual turnover reached during the past paper period. The transition from paper to electronic occurred in Belgium somewhat later than in other Western European countries. This confirms the position of Belgium often taking up an average position in Western Europe.

AB  - The academic literature has arguably never been more accessible. Through the internet, academics - and the wider public - are presented with an increasing array of platforms which offer sources of academic literature and information sources. Large-scale platforms – such as Google Scholar – often utilise algorithms in order to manage how search query results are prioritised and presented to searchers. This ‘sorting by relevance’ introduces an opaque layer to how readers engage with the literature, with potentially important implications for academic rigour and equity. Academic publishing and citation practices often serve to preserve privilege; in turn, there is a risk that algorithms which draw upon data sources such as these will compound biases. There is a need to interrogate how such algorithms work, and academics’ assumptions about the mechanisms behind them. This paper starts a critical discussion of the issue of algorithm-mediated academic literature searches. First, it draws upon the existing literature – primarily related to Google Scholar. This is followed by a mapping of the use of algorithms across a sample of major academic databases. Algorithms are found to be used extensively, although how they operate varies and is often not clear. The paper concludes with next steps for this project.

AB  - Internet ha generado cambios en la comunicación científica creando un nuevo modelo de acceso libre y rápido a los resultados de investigación al que poco a poco se adaptan las instituciones educativas. Este artículo analiza la percepción sobre políticas y prácticas de acceso abierto por docentes de La Universidad de la Guajira – Colombia (Uniguajira) y la Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León- México (UANL). Metodológicamente se asumió una investigación no experimental de corte comparativo. Se utilizó un diseño muestral aleatorio con (n: 245) participantes. Los resultados evidencian una actitud favorable de los docentes frente a la comunicación científica en abierto, con valoraciones superiores en la escala media general de 3.3/4 para UANL frente a 2.97/4 en Uniguajira. Se concluye que existe disposición de los docentes para compartir contenidos científicos de libre acceso, y que a nivel institucional se debe fortalecer políticas y prácticas que favorezcan el acceso abierto.

AB  - In the spring of 2015, 14 faculty members in social science or in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) spoke with a working group from the University of Kansas (KU) Libraries regarding their research needs and challenges. Their responses highlighted a dynamic research environment in which individual researchers desire to connect with other experts, yet often remain isolated within their departments. Common challenges included dealing with data storage, management, and preservation, as well as understanding publication impact and dissemination methods. Respondents looked to KU Libraries as a neutral entity that could connect them to experts, materials, and practices that would enhance their research.

AB  - Abstract When one considers the building blocks of scholarly communication, it is possible to see historical trends forcing them apart into relatively specialized and isolated roles. Today, the entities that are most concerned with professional support of scholarly communication are academic institutions, professional associations, scholarly publishers, and libraries. Each of these faces disconcerting change: in their markets, in their mission, in their revenue streams, in their operational strategies, and in the technology they use to facilitate their work. Simultaneously, the concept of information management is used to reinvent the role of librarians. As a result, knowledge workers in these fields face instability on practical levels, and ambiguity on philosophic levels. The opening address will attempt to describe the conditions of our dilemma and suggest ways for resolving those conflicts, as a preparation for the sessions to follow.

AB  - A wide diversity exists in the current practice of transliterating Cyrillic scripts for use in bibliographic records in online catalogs. Without knowing which transliteration table was used, it is difficult to retrieve the desired record successfully or efficiently. Retrieving an item (e.g., titles or an author's name) from a library's online catalog (OPAC) where it is given only in transliterated form can be a confusing task, even for users who know the Russian language or at least the Cyrillic alphabet. This study explores the problems besetting three groups of Russian-language students faced with romanized Cyrillic bibliographic records. It also tries to investigate students' ability in searching the Russian records romanized according to the Library of Congress (LC) transliteration table. Analysis of the test results show the students' success-and-error rate before and after instruction. The findings of this study establish that transliteration is one of the factors limiting access _by Russian language students to the Slavic collections.

It analyzes the market demand, supply, and prices of STM books and how they affect academic libraries' budgets. A semilogarithmic econometric model is formulated to explore the factors that affect STM book prices. Various product features, including book length, cover type, format, supplier types, and publication locations, are examined. The empirical results are mostly statistically significant, particularly for some key factors. The overall findings of this study have policy implications for academic libraries' books collections and acquisitions.

JMWAIS editors also seek to participate in possible solutions to better managing, finding, and disseminating scholarly communications. To further this goal, in Fall 2017, JMWAIS editors created Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for all previously published articles. Future JMWAIS articles will also be assigned individual DOI.

AB  - Authors present a fairly detailed review of main trends as discussed at seminars held within the London Book Fair 2019. As to publishing business in general it is noted that the sales of print are rising for the fourth year in a row. E-book sales are growing in the UK and falling in the US for the second consecutive year (down 3.6% in 2018) while downloadable audiobooks continue to support publishing business with double digit growth in sales (up 37.1% in 2018). Improving technology, especially smart speakers give a boost to audiobook popularity. People are increasingly listening to audiobooks at home in the evening hours of 8pm to 10pm making them an important form of leisure. Audiobooks are in great demand in libraries. Libraries buy them from publishers and audiobooks are primarily circulated in the same way as print books, that is, “one book – one borrower”. In the era of fake news proliferation, quality research findings are important for making informed decisions (for instance, in environmental protection). We need standards and procedures that will help us recognize valid research – like cross-checking, fact checking, tracing the source of information, taking into account whether the material was published in academic or predator journals, journal blacklists and whitelists, differentiation between research and sponsored content.

AB  - Introdução: A publicação de artigos científicos é necessária para a divulgação da ciência. Objetivo: Neste contexto, o objetivo geral é analisar o cenário internacional da publicação científica sobre Epistemologia em periódicos da área de Biblioteconomia e Ciência da Informação, indexados pela Web of Science (WoS). Os objetivos específicos são: a) identificar os títulos de periódicos com maior número de publicação sobre o tema, bem como sua tipificação editorial; b) relatar os tipos de acesso dos periódicos por país; c) apontar as palavras-chave mais utilizadas e d) Identificar os epistemólogos mais utilizados no referencial teórico. Metodologia: O estudo foi caracterizado como exploratório, descritivo e quantitativo. Como procedimentos técnicos, fez-se uma pesquisa bibliográfica na principal coleção da WoS utilizando a estratégia de busca: (TI=(epistem*) AND SU=(library and Information Science)). O período estipulado foi de 2003 a 2018 e obteve-se um total de 113 artigos válidos. Resultados: Os resultados mostram que os periódicos com mais artigos publicados foram Knowledge Organization, com 14 artigos, seguido do Journal of Documentation, com nove artigos. Observa-se que os 113 artigos foram publicados em 41 títulos de periódicos e que pertencem a 26 editoras distintas. Quanto aos epistemólogos mais citados, o destaque foi para Kuhn. Conclusões: Conclui-se que as editoras comerciais possuem um amplo mercado, prevalecendo os altíssimos valores das taxas. O valor médio foi de 2.778,88 dólares americanos. Por fim, verificou-se que a produção científica sobre Epistemologia em Ciência da Informação é tematicamente diversa e aplicada, notando uma aproximação do campo epistemológico aos estudos de Organização do Conhecimento.

AB  - This article, the second in a two-part series, focuses on the roles that various library departments can and should play in the development of a robust scholarly communication program. It discusses how the crisis in scholarly communication affects different work areas and groups of staff. A whole-library approach to addressing the crisis can reveal how each department's responsibilities require management of different scholarly communication issues. The article also addresses the ways in which technical services is particularly impacted by the crisis in scholarly communication in order to provide a more in-depth analysis of how a discrete work area within the library experiences the crisis.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to conduct a comprehensive, objective and critical analysis of the results of research on open access in Ukraine to assess the current state of the topic and identify the aspects which require deeper study in order to develop an effective mechanism for implementing the principles of open access in practice. Research methods. The method of narrative literature review with a defined search strategy and criteria for selecting publications in four databases, such as Dimensions, Scopus, Web of Science and the depository of electronic copies “Scientific Periodicals of Ukraine” was used. The inclusion criteria were articles published by authors affiliated with Ukrainian institutions. The scientific novelty lies in the fact that the literature analysis helped to expand and deepen knowledge about the thematic areas of open access research in Ukraine; to identify previously unknown links and contradictions between studies; and to identify areas that require further studies, which include, in particular, the analysis of factors and barriers that facilitate or prevent Ukrainian authors from disseminating their works in open access, the dynamics of growth and peculiarities of the distribution of the share of open access publications by year and field of study. Conclusions. Open access is one of the main components of Open Science. It serves as a tool for accelerating knowledge sharing, developing science, helping to eliminate inequality, and helping to solve several global problems. The research of Ukrainian scientists focuses on four primary areas of open access research: the development of open access policies at the level of institutions and the state, the introduction of institutional repositories, the launch of open access journals, and the regulation of copyright in open scientific communication.

AB  - Electronic resources have hugely complicated the supply chain. Losing access to paid-for resources is common, and may be caused by miscommunication, lengthy reconciliation of payments to accounts, journal transfers and changing agents. There are many uses in the supply chain for institutional identifiers, and some of the new and developing relevant standards in this area are summarized. Being able to uniquely identify the institutions at each stage in the supply chain can cut down on access losses, and if libraries, agents, publishers and hosting services can agree on and implement a standard institutional identifier, loss of access may become a thing of the past.

AB  - Electronic publishing, especially publishing for the Web, is slowly becoming the main avenue for the dissemination of scholarly edited versions of primary texts. While this is a welcome development and increases access to high quality resources for casual users, it also poses new hindrances to deeper engagement with texts published in such a way. This article discusses some of the requirements for such a deeper engagement with texts, both in terms of the needed functionality, which includes commenting, annotating, translating, but also linking and enriching the texts and in terms of the needed overall architecture and the desired modes of communication between readers of such texts.

AB  - This article reports the results of a 2019 survey of academic librarians that investigated their attitudes, practices, and policies regarding open access (OA). This study asks if academic librarians write policies to ensure that they approach OA intentionally and systematically across all library services. The results indicate that, though librarians report favorable beliefs about OA and integrating OA into technical and public services, they seldom create OA policies.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to conduct a comparative analysis of institutional repositories of higher education institutions of Ukraine for training specialists in the field of information, library, and archival studies as a component of the quality of academic communication in the modern educational space. The research methodology is based on the application of the theory of scientific communication, general scientific and special methods of cognition, including analysis, synthesis, monitoring, and comparison. The scientific novelty of the study is to expand the understanding of the current situation of demand among users of scientific and educational resources of institutional repositories of higher education institutions for the training of specialists in the field of information, library, and archival studies. Conclusions. The article analyses the institutional repositories of ten higher education institutions for training of specialists in the field of information, library, and archival studies using Webometrics, QS World University Rankings, and SimilarWeb. Despite the high-ranking positions of the leading higher education institutions in Webometrics and QS World University Rankings, user access to institutional repositories remains at an insufficient level. A study based on web analytics by SimilarWeb has identified four leading HEIs by the number of visits to their repositories by users: Western Ukrainian National University (WUNU), Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (TSNU), National Aviation University (NAU), and Lesya Ukrainka Volyn National University (VNU). The level of use of the main communication channels (direct access, regular (standard) search, referrals, e-mail, social networks) for the use of repositories by each higher education institution is also determined, and recommendations are given on the promotion of scientific and educational resources of repositories and the use of PR and advertising technologies by librarians and all participants of scientific communication of higher education institutions to improve its quality in the modern educational space. Key words: institutional repository, higher education institution, electronic archive, training of specialists in the field of information, library, and archive studies, communication channels, scientific communication.

AB  - Abstract The panel will discuss the importance of understanding the research environment for providing effective information and technology support to researchers, and the implications for curricula in professional education. Our specific context is growing involvement of academic libraries and information services in managing research data, but the issues raised have wider implications for educating and developing other information specialists (e.g., in research institutes, government agencies, public libraries). Studies in the past five years have identified technical and discipline‐related skills and knowledge gaps as potential constraints on developing library research data services. Our recent research in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Ireland confirmed the need for data curation and technology skills, but also found practitioners engaging in other forms of research support, and expressing needs for a multilayered introduction to the research environment, extending beyond the research skills typically gained in masters programs, including subjects such as academic culture and practice, and research policy and evaluation. The panelists represent a mix of academic and practitioner viewpoints from different countries. They will each offer their views on what is missing and should be added to graduate curricula, and how programs can make space, asking the audience to respond with their own suggestions, counter‐arguments, and alternative visions, using an interactive style from the start.

AB  - ABSTRACT The explosion of scientific data in recent years has resulted in the need to compile, store and globally share this research information with the multi‐disciplinary communities of science. This has resulted in research data management communities that are responsible for curating data within institutional repositories. This panel is sponsored by the SIG Scientific and Technical Information to initiate a discussion addressing data curation issues as they pertain to collaborative research data management communities within the current institutional research environment from the perspective of key stakeholders. The panel objective encompasses an examination of contemporary curation practices and data management policy issues that impact the initiation and implementation of research data management plans for scientific researchers. In addition it will explore the role that institutional repositories play in the extraction, preservation, and storage of research data while providing access to data sharing in the global scientific research communities. The panel will be comprised of key institutional stakeholders, which include university administrators, information professionals, and research scientists.

AB  - The appearance of the Philosophical Transactions in 1665 marked the emergence of scientific journals as the dominant mode for dissemination of research and discoveries. The journal system served numerous fundamental needs within the scientific community and encouraged a climate of increased sharing of knowledge. As the rhetoric of scientific discourse evolved over time, a highly stable format emerged to govern the research article as a genre. In the contemporary era of networked science, however, informal scientific communication is also growing in importance as researchers turn to online collaborative tools for even more rapid sharing of results and work in progress.

AB  - Open Education (OE) opens up learning opportunities to, potentially, every person in the world. Additionally, it allows teachers, researchers, and practitioners to find, share, reuse, and improve existing resources under a dependable legal framework. Aiming to spread and foster the introduction of open policies in Higher Education (HE) institutions, the gamified interactive learning experience Catch the Open! was developed. Catch the Open! targets HE educators who wish to learn, or who wish to deepen their existing knowledge, about OE and Open Educational Practices (OEP). Within the gamified learning experience, the user becomes an educator, Alex, the game character, who receives a task from the Rector: to investigate how to best include OE and OEP in teaching and learning practice within the institution. Alex proceeds to explore and gather information in a web-based 2D virtual HE institution where students, colleagues, and guest researchers will help her to develop a comprehensive understanding of OE and the practical application of OEP. The educational content within Catch the Open! is underpinned by an OE competences framework for HE educators, developed in a previous phase of the Erasmus+ OpenGame project. In this paper, the design process to link pedagogical and technological approaches, which results in the Catch the Open! gamified web-based interactive application, is presented as well as the application itself. Moreover, two phases of piloting with 153 HE educators from six different HE institutions are presented. The obtained findings showed that the gamified environment helped in learning about OE. On the other hand, learners also suggested several improvement aspects of the gamified environment, such as the length of finishing a learning mission while playing.

AB  - An open access repository or open archive is a digital platform that holds research output and provides free, immediate and permanent access to research results for anyone to use, download and distribute. To facilitate open access such repositories must be interoperable according to the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). Search engines harvest the content of open access repositories, constructing a database of worldwide, free of charge available research. OpenDOAR is the quality-assured, global Directory of Open Access Repositories. Its repositories provide free, open access to academic outputs and resources. This paper deals with Comparative analysis of India and Australia repositories listed in OpenDOAR in terms of their growth, type, operational status, content type, software, subject coverage, language and policies regarding content, submission, and preservation. Keywords: Digital Repositories, Institutional Repositories, Open Access, OpenDOAR.

AB  - The Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL) was a pioneering library consortium that evolved from a small informal group of research library directors known as the "Taskforce for Interlibrary Cooperation" in the early 1970s. Early projects included shared acquisitions funding, a union list of serials, and a shared public access catalog. Drawing upon published sources, unpublished primary sources, archival records and personal interviews with early participants, this article provides an account of the key individuals of the organization, the technological innovations of CARL, and its legacy within the library community.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide an alternative method of building quality collections for Jewish Studies collection development professionals in small and medium‐sized academic libraries with highly restricted budgets. Design/methodology/approach Sources of Jewish Studies literary awards were identified and a detailed analysis of awarded books' subjects and the publishing sources was conducted. Findings The results show that awarded books cover a vast variety of subjects of interest to Jewish Studies collections. Since many of them are also published by academic presses, the use of identified Jewish Studies book award sources should be considered by bibliographers responsible for building Jewish Studies collections in non‐sectarian college libraries with very limited budgetary resources. Practical implications The “one stop” access to all award sources and awarded books provides an easy access to otherwise dispersed information. Originality/value The comprehensive list of awards, nominated and winning titles, as well as the subject analysis presented herein, is the first of its kind. This can be used by Jewish Studies bibliographers to build and improve their collections and can also serve as a model for building other interdisciplinary subject collections.

AB  - Semantic tags can enrich citation graphs by inter-connecting papers with citation reasons. One of the best sources of knowledge to tell the reason for citation is the author himself. Integrating these reasons in an authoring system can help authors to choose a reason while citing. We examined various Human and Automatic authoring systems for integration of citation reasons. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such system exists that facilities authors to integrate the reasons while citing. Same is the case with Cite Packages. This research proposes integration of <i>CCRO</i>:Citations&#x2019; Context and Reasons Ontology&#x2019;s (Ihsan and Qadir, 2019) taxonomic hierarchy of reasons within document. We have developed a <i>CCRO</i> Package to semantically tag citations with reasons and to create an intra-discourse relation between research articles. Furthermore, embedding these structures within <i>RDF</i> Data Store enables the creation of knowledge graphs that become a foundation artifact for the Semantic &#x0026; Scientific Discourse.

AB  - Apresenta brevemente o conceito de e-science. Trata-se de um estudo quantitativo que analisa as publicações sobre o tema e-science na área da ciência da informação. O universo da pesquisa é formado por 202 registros de documentos das bases de dados LISA e LISTA. A análise dos dados revela um crescimento do volume de publicações sobre o tema e demonstra que dentre os 202 registros analisados, 172 são de artigos de periódicos. Ainda, confirma o fenômeno de que poucos autores publicam muito. A Inglaterra foi o país que mais se destacou na análise dos dados, visto que demonstrou pioneirismo em programas de governo para e-science. Dentre as associações profissionais da ciência da informação, destaca-se a atuação da Association of Research Libraries. Ressalta-se que foram encontrados 3 artigos de autores brasileiros indexados sobre o tema.

AB  - In recent years, technical services operations and collection management at the University of South Florida (USF) Library was operating with flat budgets, a staff organization in a state of transition, ineffective workplace communication, and a progressive loss of institutional knowledge and skill sets. During the same time, the university was characterized by a fast‐developing dynamic research and learning environment. New research endeavors and academic programs were incorporating a variety of electronic resources in their activities. In response, library administrators implemented a strategy of organizing technical services operations into a community of practice with three key elements. The three elements included redefining technical staff organization, enhancing collaboration and communication, and building new work areas. This paper illustrates how the technical services operations at USF was remodeled by modifying staff organization and workspaces into collaborative teams. The team approach has focused skill sets on multiformat collection problem solving and enhanced service delivery to library patrons. The reorganization has transformed a department previously centered on processing print publications to a department focused on managing diverse activities including evidence‐based acquisitions programs in both e‐book and streaming formats as well as diverse e‐journal and database subscriptions. The new Collections & Discovery Unit has a shared mission and vision. The unit staff members have built a knowledge base of diverse information and solutions to meet the challenges of a fast‐changing academic landscape.

AB  - The article describes the results of the online survey on open science (OS) carried out on researchers affiliated with universities and Spanish research centres and focused on open access to scientific publications, the publication process, the management of research data and the review of open articles. The main objective was to identify the perception and habits of researchers with regard to practices closely linked to open science and the scientific value added is that offers an in-depth picture of researchers as one of the main actors to whom this transformation and implementation of open science will fall. It focuses on the different aspects of OS: open access, open data, publication process and open review in order to identify habits and perceptions. This is to make possible an implementation of the OS movement. The survey was carried out among researchers who had published in the years 2020-2021, according to data obtained from WoS. It was emailed to a total of 8,188 researchers and obtained a total of 666 responses, of which 554 were complete, the rest being forms with some questions unanswered. The main results showed that open access still requires the diffusion of practices and services provided by the institution, as well as training (library or equivalent service) and institutional support from the competent authorities (vice rectors or equivalent) in specific aspects such as data management. In the case of data, around 50% of respondents stated they had stored data in a repository, and of all the options, the most frequently given was that of an institutional repository, followed by a discipline repository. Among the main reasons for doing this, we found transparency, visibility of data and the ability to validate results. For those who stated they had never stored data, the most frequent reasons for not having done so were privacy and confidentiality, the lack of a mandated data policy or a lack of knowledge of how to do it. In terms of open peer review, participants mentioned a certain reticence to the opening of evaluations due to potential conflicts of interest that may arise or because lower-quality content might be accepted in order to avoid conflicts. In addition, the hierarchical structure of senior researcher versus junior researcher might affect reviews. The main conclusions indicate a need for persuasion of OA to take place; APCs are an economic barrier rather than the main criterion for journal selection; OPR practices may seem innovative and emerging; scientific and evaluation policies seem to have a clear effect on the behaviour of researchers; researchers state that they share research data more for reasons of persuasion than out of obligation. Researchers do question the pathways or difficulties that may arise on a day-to-day basis and seem aware that we are undergoing change, where academic evaluation or policies related to open science, its implementation and habits among researchers may change. In this sense, more and better support is needed on the part of institutions and faculty support services.

AB  - This paper discusses MathML, an XML-based standard for expressing mathematics - everything from elementary mathematics to undergraduate college-level mathematics. Limitations of pre-existing options led to the creation of MathML. MathML is designed to be useful for authoring and publishing, for creating online interactive math resources, and as a non-proprietary approach for archiving. MathML is supported by the W3C and by multiple scholarly publishers and vendors of computer-based mathematics software. The question now is whether MathML can achieve greater acceptance among authors and better integration with standards in related domains, either through cross-walks or through direct incorporation into other domain schemas.

AB  - Abstract When the Internet came into being, the information services industry entered an increasingly turbulent phase. It has become clear that traditional relationships in the information chain have changed radically with the advancement of electronic information delivery. Libraries, publishers, and subscription agents alike are being presented with challenges to their familiar roles and to their positions in our industry. Web technology and Internet distribution offer new opportunities to disseminate and access information. The downside of the Internet is the increased complexity of the industry in which we operate, with more suppliers, more formats, new types of relationships, more platforms, new pricing and licensing models, and new ways of buying and selling information. This includes the upsurge of consortia, increasing demand for individual articles, and linking ofvarious content types. It is becoming apparent that the future of the current subscription model and the journal in its present form has become questionable. All of these developments have resulted in new processes, operations, and systems, highlighting the strong need for agents to act as infomediaries in the electronic environment as the complexity increases. In this presentation we will assess current developments, future trends, and their impact on the value chain in general and, more specifically, the role of infomediaries. This timely assessment is relevant to all NASIG constituents as the roles of librarians, publishers, and subscription agents alike are being challenged by these developments. The world in which we now operate will be significantly different, possibly even unrecognizable, in the relatively short space of the next five years.

AB  - Introduction: Pacific University Libraries has had an institutional repository since 2009, when it selected Digital Commons to host a collection of theses and dissertations. Since then, the scope of the services has grown to include publishing open access journals as well as housing the books published by Pacific University Press—a library-born, hybrid, open access press. As our needs have changed, and with Elsevier’s acquisition of bepress in 2017, the University migrated from bepress’ Digital Commons platform to an open source Hyku platform hosted by Ubiquity Repositories. Description of Program: As the first academic institution working with Ubiquity Repositories on migration and implementation, we were involved in the process of data extraction, normalization, mapping, ingest, and validation. Lessons Learned: We learned the importance of having a mutual understanding of a platform’s goals, data structure and mapping, and standards in implementation decisions. Next Steps: As higher education continues to adapt to the changes brought by COVID-19, it has never seemed more important to utilize platforms that share the values of libraries worldwide. We hope that migrating to an open source platform will be a step toward more open scholarship, despite the current challenges and resource scarcity brought about by the pandemic.

AB  - Our proposal of an Open Science definition as a political and legal framework where research outputs are shared and disseminated in order to be rendered visible, accessible, reusable is developed, standing over the concepts enhanced by the Budapest Open Science Initiative (BOAI), and by the Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) and Open data movements. We elaborate this proposal through a detailed analysis of some selected EC policies and laws as well as of the function of research evaluation practices. The legal aspects considered in our examination include, in particular, the study of the role of licences in the context of the dissemination of research outputs.

AB  - The article highlights the place and the role problems of media technologies in future preschool and primary school teachers' training. We disclosed the meanings of «media education», «media technology» and other. The authors review the works of M. McLuhan about the global character of information and media environment, G. Gerbner's about the media influence on human personality. The «Concept of Implementation media education in Ukraine» have been analysed for the role and the place of media in the preschool, primary and higher education systems. We conducted a media literacy survey amond the students of «Preschool education» and «Primary education» speciality. It showed the sufficient level of students' ICT readiness, and readiness to applie media technology in the educational process, but it isn't attention to destructive impact of aggressive media environment to a child. It was suggested to integrate the educational media elements into teachers' training programs. Subject «The methodology of forming mathematical elements» shows for example using online tools (electronic resources) in the training of future teachers. We proved the necessity and relevancy role of media education technologies in future preschool and primary school teachers' training.

AB  - Journals play a pivotal role in disseminating scientific knowledge, housing a multitude of valuable research articles. In this digital age, the evaluation of journals and their quality is essential. The SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) stands as one of the prominent platforms for ranking journals, categorizing them into five index classes: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and NQ. Determining these index classes often relies on classification methodologies. This research, drawing inspiration from the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), seeks to employ the Random Forest method to classify journals, thus contributing to the refinement of journal ranking processes. Random Forest stands out as a robust choice due to its remarkable ability to mitigate overfitting, a common challenge in machine learning classification tasks. In the context of approximating SJR index classes, Random Forest, when utilizing the Gini index, exhibits promise, albeit with an initial accuracy rate of 62.12%. The Gini index, an impurity measure, enables Random Forest to make informed decisions while classifying journals into their respective SJR index classes. However, it is worth noting that this accuracy rate represents a starting point, and further refinement and feature engineering may enhance the model's performance. This research underscores the significance of machine learning techniques in the domain of journal classification and journal-ranking systems. By harnessing the power of Random Forest, this study aims to facilitate more accurate and efficient categorization of journals, thereby aiding researchers, academics, and institutions in identifying and accessing high-quality scientific literature.

AB  - Due to the increasing availability of digital content and systems improvements that have accelerated physical delivery, academic libraries are afforded opportunities to more efficiently provide users access to library materials. A theory for efficient provision of information resources, and thus more efficient use of financial resources, was proposed by one of the coauthors in "The Future of Academic Library Materials Expenditures: A Thought Experiment." The strategies on which the theory is based include purchase on demand, library publishing, and improved open access discovery. This article details the theory and then examines IUPUI University Library's experience of implementing strategies based on this theory. The authors analyze the effectiveness of the theory and offer guidance for libraries considering a similar path.

AB  - The majority of today's scholarly papers are authored in Microsoft Word. Some of those papers include simple and/or complex math. Authors have at their disposal multiple means to insert equations in Word documents, including several of Word's native equation editors and third‐party applications, such as Design Science's MathType . Building workflows that smoothly and accurately transform all of these formats into the appropriate XML markup for use in multiple rendering environments has many challenges. This paper clarifies the different forms of equations that can be encountered in Word documents and discusses the issues and idiosyncrasies of converting these various forms to MathML , LaTeX , and/or images in the JATS XML model. It also touches on workflow alternatives for handling equations in various rendering environments and how those downstream requirements may affect the means of equation extraction from Word documents.

AB  - Involving free online resources in the library services improves the information support for users. The terms "free resources", "open" are used for designation of free resources, which do not require financial compensation. In practice, however, Russian libraries have not yet developed a unified approach for understanding the terms "free resources", "free access", "open access". ISO 5127 and ISO 2789 International Standards recommend including in the library's collections these free Internet resources, which could be catalogued by the library in its online catalogue or some other library database. It's necessary to define the groups of networked resources which the library can include in its collections, and those resources that are of interest to users, but couldn't be included in the library stock. Organization of access to free resources shall be carried out in two ways: entering information about the resources in the library catalogue or other database and providing common search or the development of navigation tools based on the links grouped by any attribute on the library website. Processing of all kinds of free resources for users is part of the technological scheme of the network resources collection development and has various specific characteristics that affect the selection, registration, administration and management of the electronic resources.

AB  - Zusammenfassung Das Aufbereiten von Manuskripten für verschiedene Formate wie HTML oder EPUB kann Verlage vor Herausforderungen stellen: Für eine hohe Professionalität ist eine umfassende technische Expertise oft ebenso vonnöten wie die Nutzung kostenintensiver XML-Content-Management-Systeme. Eine Innovation in diesem Bereich stellt das vom BMBF geförderte Projekt „Open Source Academic Publishing Suite (OS-APS)“ dar. Es soll Wissenschaftsverlagen ermöglichen, auf einfachem Weg medienneutral zu publizieren, indem XML-basierte Workflows genutzt werden. Das XML wird automatisiert aus Word-Manuskripten extrahiert und das Corporate Design der exportierten PDFs kann über Templates gesteuert werden.

AB  - Existen ejemplos de revistas electrónica científicas de acceso abierto (open access, OA) desde la aparición de Internet, sin embargo con la Declaración de Budapest en la que se define el significado de OA y las revistas como una vía para alcanzarlo es cuando empieza a identificarse revistas de acceso abierto que ya lo eran, y a surgir otras con modelos inexistentes en la época de las revistas en versión impresa. En este trabajo se analiza cómo el movimiento OA ha repercutido sobre las vías de comunicación y acceso a la producción científica, y las consecuencias que ha tenido en la evolución del mercado editorial y los nuevos modelos de revistas basados no exclusivamente en el acceso por pago de suscripción. También se exponen resumidamente algunas de las tendencias en cuanto a la publicación electrónica, que desde el punto de vista de la comunidad científica tienen que ver con la creación de entornos colaborativos, el intercambio y la reutilización de datos, entre otras, y desde el punto de vista comercial por pasar de un modelo de proveedor de contenidos al de servicios, en el que la calidad y mejores precios hagan a las editoriales empresas más competitivas.

AB  - Many librarians have advocated for the use of demand-driven acquisition (DDA) as an important money-saving approach in a time of reduced resources that target acquisitions we know will be used. In addition to saving money, the introduction of e-DDA presents an opportunity for a consortium to achieve three collection development objectives: continue to make the core publisher output available—and even more quickly and easily available; free up more of the collections budget to purchase unique content for the system across the campuses, not just at the larger schools; and allow campuses to review user activity to make systemwide, long-term decisions about user behavior and content not acquired through DDA. DDA can enable the consortium to meet the needs of the many right now as well as to continue to build some collections of depth for the system as a whole and the scholarly community writ large.

AB  - Open educational resources (OER), now in their 15th year of existence, consists of, in principle, fully open educational content, available for free to all and are adaptable to serve the needs of the user. They were created as a response to the high cost of textbooks and as a means of leveling the playing field in terms of ensuring equal access to education for disadvantaged populations. The selected resources below attest to the fact that a concerted effort is well underway to address and overcome these challenges. Institutions are increasingly investing in OER as research has demonstrated that they have a positive role to play in student learning. Libraries, already champions of copyright and open access initiatives, have the expertise to advocate for and collaborate on efforts to further the growth and impact of open educational resources both within their institutions and beyond.

AB  - This study of UCL Press sought to identify the extent to which data available to open access (OA) monograph presses can be combined with low‐cost analysis tools to provide insight into development and strategy. An additional goal was identifying practical steps that monograph publishers can take to ensure that they make the most of the data they have access to. The project team carried out an analysis of downloaded figures from platforms providing access to UCL Press monograph titles, social media activity, and sales patterns. Patterns of engagement with the books were cross‐referenced against key marketing and dissemination events in order to identify relationships between marketing approaches and awareness or use of a title. This study shows that it is possible to gain valuable insights into the uses of OA books by collating and analysing usage and social media data. It also identifies a series of relatively straightforward steps that can be taken by presses to maximize the richness of the data captured. These include proactively gathering and storing data; providing best practice advice to those engaging in promotion, particularly when promotion is via social media; and making it easier to track specific efforts to publicize books by using tagged links.

AB  - The emergence and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, particularly text-based ones known as large language models, pose both opportunities and challenges to education. The ability of these tools to generate human-like texts based on minimal instructions causes concerns among educators about students’ use of these tools for academic writing, which may constitute a breach of academic integrity. We propose a pedagogical design that models on self-regulated learning and the authoring cycle and develops students’ critical thinking and self-regulation when composing academic writing using text-based generative AI tools. It contains six iterative and interactive phases. Students first plan the content and structure of the writing, then generate prompts for text-based generative AI tools. Next, students preview and verify the tools’ output, followed by the fourth phase of producing the writing using the corrected output. Fifthly, peer review by fellow students may be required to polish and proofread the writing. Lastly, through portfolio-tracking, students reflect on the writing process, and formulate strategies for future usage of text-based generative AI tools for writing. This pedagogical design helps students and teachers embrace text-based generative AI while addressing the perils these tools present, and guides the development of education interventions and instruments.

AB  - While learning analytics (LA) has been highlighted as a field aiming to address systemic equity and quality issues within educational systems between and within regions, to date, its adoption is predominantly in the Global North. Since the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) aspires to be international in reach and relevance, and to increase the diversity and inclusivity of the SoLAR community, it is pertinent to look at learning analytics use in higher education institutions in Africa. This paper reports the first scoping review of research in the field of LA conducted on the African continent. The coding and analysis show that LA research is still in its infancy on the African continent with only 15 studies, overwhelmingly from South Africa. The study also revealed several challenges, such as limited technical support and access to LMSs, the limited visibility of African scholars at SoLAR events and publication venues, and the limited focus on interventions that involve stakeholders. The article concludes with several propositions and provocations to advance the adoption of LA in Africa and open up space for critical conversations about the potential of learning analytics in contexts with characteristics different than those found in the Global North.

AB  - Learning scientific document representations can be substantially improved through contrastive learning objectives, where the challenge lies in creating positive and negative training samples that encode the desired similarity semantics. Prior work relies on discrete citation relations to generate contrast samples. However, discrete citations enforce a hard cut-off to similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning and ignores that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation - a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SciDocs benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can train (or tune) language models sample-efficiently and that it can be combined with recent training-efficient methods. Perhaps surprisingly, even training a general-domain language model this way outperforms baselines pretrained in-domain.

AB  - This review of 2004 and 2005 serials literature covers the themes of cost, management, and access. Interwoven through the serials literature of these two years are the importance of collaboration, communication, and linkages between scholars, publishers, subscription agents and other intermediaries, and librarians. The emphasis in the literature is on electronic serials and their impact on publishing, libraries, and vendors. In response to the crisis of escalating journal prices and libraries' dissatisfaction with the Big Deal licensing agreements, Open Access journals and publishing models were promoted. Libraries subscribed to or licensed increasing numbers of electronic serials. As a result, libraries sought ways to better manage licensing and subscription data (not handled by traditional integrated library systems) by implementing electronic resources management systems. In order to provide users with better, faster, and more current information on and access to electronic serials, libraries implemented tools and services to provide A to Z title lists, title by title coverage data, MARC records, and OpenURL link resolvers.

AB  - Campus partnerships are an increasingly common and dynamic entity on college campuses. To successfully achieve institutional goals, campus partners must collaborate and create communities of practice. Open educational resources (OER) is a rapidly growing area in higher education due to the increasing costs of attending college and increased student debt. By providing access to OER, colleges are supporting student success, increasing retention of students, and, most importantly, contributing to reducing students’ higher education debt. OER initiatives often fall under the purview of the academic library. While the library is an excellent place to start an affordable learning initiative, identifying pertinent campus partners and forming communities of practice will improve awareness of OER and increase OER adoption. This study utilized a survey to identify levels of current awareness and adoption of OER among faculty at a master’s comprehensive four-year public university in Pennsylvania. The goal was to provide a benchmark for assessing future progress. It also provided structure and a programming plan for a newly developed collaboration between the library, distance education, and Information Services & Technology. Survey results assisted the partnership in identifying ways to collaborate and implement strategies to increase awareness and adoption of OER on campus.

AB  - This paper analyzes changes to the definitions of “authorized users” contained in electronic resources licenses and embedded in access control technologies from the mid-1990s to the present. In analyzing changes to the license and technology-based definitions, it tracks shifts in major stakeholders’ perceptions of authorized users and describes developments in licensing and access control technologies. The paper demonstrates that the concept of authorized users has been shaped by a mix of social and technical elements, including changes to information providers’ and libraries’ business models and missions, shifts in norms for license terms, and development of technological tools used to facilitate or constrain access.

AB  - These data, from a group of liberal arts college libraries as well as from the much more scrutinized ARL libraries, raise important questions about certain articles of faith in academic librarianship.These questions relate to: the "doubling time" of library collections; the "60-30-10" division of library expenditures; the growing robustness of materials expenditures as a percentage of total expenditures, especially among the college libraries; and the phenomenon of increases in total expenditures considerably exceeding increases in major price indexes.''That most librarians dislike statistical records is patent.But without figures capable of intelligent interpretation, we are seriously handicapped indeed.William Thomas Kelvin expressed the need adequately and succinctly, ' ... when you can measure whatever you are talking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it.'" -Lawrence S.

AB  - AbstractThe authors analyze the issues that the Michigan Molecular Institute Library (MMI) will face in the transition from print to digital serials. The library supports a specialized research institute with sixty-eight serial subscriptions from forty-two publishers. Its specialized nature limits the number of potential consortia partners. Strengths include a user community of skilled researchers in a well-defined research area. In this transition, MMI will encounter both similar and different issues than those found in larger academic and research libraries. Topics include current access, planning, licensing, archival concerns, interlibrary loan (ILL), interoperability, and emerging trends. The authors recommend that the MMI librarian periodically evaluate the collection strategy in keeping with changing trends. AcknowledgementsThe following article is the result of a study by Natalie A. Tucker, a student in the Wayne State University Library & Information Science Program, under the direction of Robert P. Holley, professor, Library & Information Science, Wayne State University, during the fall and winter terms, 2002–2003.

AB  - The effect of technology has caused many institutions to intend to change their approach to teaching and learning, resulting in the current model of teaching and learning being an active collaborative and self-directed one. The connection between education and technology has received attention as part of educational policy and practice. Debatable topics like how to use technology in the classroom have therefore punctuated complaints about declining educational standards, unemployed learners, duplicate curricula, and archaic institutional structure. In the framework of information and communication technologies and societal growth, the Internet of Things (IoT) is asserting its vital position. Institutions may improve learning outcomes with the use of the Internet of Things by offering enhanced learning experiences, increasing operational effectiveness, and collecting real-time, actionable insight into student performance. The current state of the Internet of Educational Things (IoET) is examined from several educational perspectives in this article; a few of them are highlighted, and both of their established and potential educational benefits are discussed. Additionally, it provides in-depth discussions on current issues and problems for the IoET from a variety of approaches. The investigation performs a bibliometric analysis with VOSviewer to focus on peer-reviewed research articles published in well-known publications databases over the past eight (8) years. The findings of this study should also act as a strong incentive for universities and colleges around the world to use IoT-based teaching and learning technology for improved academic achievement.

AB  - Archaeological LiDAR has evolved into an indispensable component of archaeological prospection and landscape archaeology. However, it is frequently employed as a black-box digital method, which confines it to the realm of a specialized field. Making scientific publications more accessible, transparent, and reproducible is one of the steps required to turn LiDAR into a background method for all archaeologists. This is possible, according to our proposal, through the Executable Map Paper concept. This concept can be understood as a type of executable paper that pursues Open Science&rsquo;s goals. The proposed technical solution consists of a PDF frontend, a persistence layer, and a hyperlinked interactive map. Executable Map Paper is applicable to all map-dependent sciences, including geography, geology, and any geoscience. In this paper, we outline the theoretical context, propose technical solutions, and provide a practical illustration.

AB  - ABSTRACT This strategic session/article is an update to one given over 10 years ago at the 1994 NASIG Conference. From the publisher's and the subscription agent's view, journal pricing is described for both the traditional print and the electronic formats. The publisher's view includes what factors are considered when setting pricing. How the agent handles journal pricing is discussed in detail as well as the changes caused by the advent of the electronic journal. To complete the business picture, the agent's view shows how the service charges for libraries are calculated as part of the revenue stream for agents.

AB  - This investigation explores scholarly communication business models in American Library Association (ALA) division peer-reviewed academic journals. Previous studies reveal the numerous issues organizations and publishers face in the academic publishing environment. Through an analysis of documented procedures, policies, and finances of five ALA division journals, we compare business and access models. We conclude that some ALA divisions prioritize the costs associated with changing business models, including hard-to-estimate costs such as the labor of volunteers. For other divisions, the financial aspects are less important than maintaining core values, such as those defined in ALA’s Core Values in Librarianship.

AB  - Contemporary evidence-informed policy-making (EIPM) and societies require openly accessible high-quality knowledge as input into transparent and accountable decision-making and informed societal action. Open Science1 supports this requirement. As both enablers and logical consequences of the paradigm of Open Science, the ideas of Open Access, Open Data, and FAIR publishing principles revolutionise how academic research needs to be conceptualised, conducted, disseminated, published, and used. This ‘academic openness quartet’ is especially relevant for the ways in which research data are created, annotated, curated, managed, shared, reproduced, (re-)used, and further developed in academia. Greater accessibility of scientific output and scholarly data also aims at increasing the transparency and reproducibility of research results and the quality of research itself. In the applied ‘academic openness quartet’ perspective, they also function as remedies for academic malaises, like missing replicability of results or secrecy around research data. Against this backdrop, the present article offers a conceptual discussion on the four academic openness paradigms, their meanings, interrelations, as well as potential benefits and challenges arising from their application in data-driven research.

AB  - In the last decade, scholarly graphs became fundamental to storing and managing scholarly knowledge in a structured and machine-readable way. Methods and tools for discovery and impact assessment of science rely on such graphs and their quality to serve scientists, policymakers, and publishers. Since research data became very important in scholarly communication, scholarly graphs started including dataset metadata and their relationships to publications. Such graphs are the foundations for Open Science investigations, data-article publishing workflows, discovery, and assessment indicators. However, due to the heterogeneity of practices (FAIRness is indeed in the making), they often lack the complete and reliable metadata necessary to perform accurate data analysis; e.g., dataset metadata is inaccurate, author names are not uniform, and the semantics of the relationships is unknown, ambiguous or incomplete. This work describes an open and curated scholarly graph we built and published as a training and test set for data discovery, data connection, author disambiguation, and link prediction tasks. Overall the graph contains 4,047 publications, 5,488 datasets, 22 software, 21,561 authors; 9,692 edges interconnect publications to datasets and software and are labeled with semantics that outline whether a publication is citing, referencing, documenting , supplementing another product. To ensure high-quality metadata and semantics, we relied on the information extracted from PDFs of the publications and the datasets and software webpages to curate and enrich nodes metadata and edges semantics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever published resource, including publications and datasets with manually validated and curated metadata.

AB  - Most new concepts both in the Russian and English languages are expressed using phrases or compound words, because such complex words make it possible to represent a particular concept with completeness and accuracy. But multicomponent terms—complex words and phrases—are cumbersome; therefore, there is a need to abbreviate them in one way or another. In some cases this leads to the use of short versions of the term in the form of only one main component, while in others, various types of abbreviations are used, which can save time. However, their imprecise or incorrect translation can change or confuse the intended meaning. The paper discusses the differences in using abbreviations and acronyms in British and American scientific texts, as well as difficulties of their translation and optimal strategies of interlanguage adaptation. The investigation is performed using various research techniques, including a comparative method, a continuous sampling method, semantic structure analysis, and contextual analysis. It is shown that the existing modern classifications of abbreviations greatly differ in linguistic scientific literature and lexical units are abbreviated using various methods. It is found that there exist various traditions of their usage in scientific and technical texts. It is demonstrated that various standards for introducing, spelling, and punctuating abbreviations and acronyms in British and American scientific journals pose additional difficulties in the work of a translator in the field of science and technology, provokes translation errors and requires the use of normalization and explication as the main strategies for their translation. The paper may be of interest for those who translate scientific texts for British and American readership.

AB  - Today, one can observe shifts in the research landscape, which is formed by digitization and open science principles. The open science movement continues to gain momentum, attention and debate. In parallel with the principle of unity, open science gives rise to a taxonomy of several related ideas, guidelines and concepts, such as open access, open replicable research and open data. Over the past fifteen years, research institutions have focused on open access to publications. However, recently the focus of attention has shifted to research data as a “new currency” in research activities and their distribution in open access, and the guiding principles of data management are becoming crucial for the wide implementation of open science practices and the effective use of data in research, industry, business and other sectors of the economy. In this context, it is relevant to carry out a thorough study of primary scientific works on open science issues and to study the role of the concept of “open research data” in the paradigm of a holistic ecosystem of open science and business ecosystem. In this work, it is proposed to use the methods of quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis, which allows to identify the main trends and form the basis for further research. The information base for this work was the international scientometric database Scopus, which enables to analyze bibliographic data using built-in tools and import them for external use in the VOSviewer software. The study revealed an increasing trend in the number of publications on the subject under study, with the highest annual growth rate in 2017 (76%) and 2019 (66%). Qualitative bibliographic analysis made it possible to analyze the most cited and, therefore, trending works on the selected topic. In terms of the number of citations per year, the results show that the studies with such directions in open science as open program code (open source); data/research reproducibility, research data management; open access to publications (open access) are most popular. In addition, a cluster analysis of the co-prevalence of keywords was conducted. It formed clusters dedicated to both institutional and infrastructural problems of the development of open science and research data. Separately, the results of the analysis create a scientific basis for further research into the key determinants of the effectiveness of the implementation of a proper research data management system at the micro, meso, and macro levels. It will improve the effectiveness of the implementation of scientific developments from one field of knowledge to another, while achieving increased interdisciplinary research. In parallel with this, interested persons of the real sector of the economy get the opportunity to analyze scientific results, determining the possibility of their adoption in their own activities.

AB  - This article theorizes the functional relationship between the human components (i.e., scholars) and non-human components (i.e., structural configurations) of academic domains. It is organized around the following question: in what ways have scholars formed and been formed by the structural configurations of their academic domain? The article uses as a case study the academic domain of education and technology to examine this question. Its authorship approach is innovative, with a worldwide collection of academics (99 authors) collaborating to address the proposed question based on their reflections on daily social and academic practices. This collaboration followed a three-round process of contributions via email. Analysis of these scholars’ reflective accounts was carried out, and a theoretical proposition was established from this analysis. The proposition is of a mutual (yet not necessarily balanced) power (and therefore political) relationship between the human and non-human constituents of an academic realm, with the two shaping one another. One implication of this proposition is that these non-human elements exist as political ‘actors’, just like their human counterparts, having ‘agency’ – which they exercise over humans. This turns academic domains into political (functional or dysfunctional) ‘battlefields’ wherein both humans and non-humans engage in political activities and actions that form the identity of the academic domain. For more information about the authorship approach, please see Al Lily AEA (2015) A crowd-authoring project on the scholarship of educational technology.

AB  - The data management plan (DMP), while seen by many as an ancillary document during a grant application, is a rich source of contextual information that is key to ensuring researchers, funders, and institutions follow the best possible and most appropriate research data management (RDM) practices. Unfortunately, the current practice is to transmit this information to the funder as a PDF or Word file through their web portals. As optimizing internal workflows and information sharing is a priority across the research space, retooling DMPs as machine-readable and machine-actionable will enable leveraging of key information to build RDM strategies collectively. Similarly, there is a growing need to streamline workflows, reuse information and reduce the burden on researchers.

AB  - ABSTRACT In putting together the NASIG strategy session “Cooperative Trends in Digital Archiving,” the three panelists, Daviess Menefee (Elsevier), Eileen Fenton (Portico), and Marilyn Geller (Lesley University), discussed issues they faced in their own organizations. All three panelists shared concerns about the need for archiving in general and for archiving born digital journals specifically, and about core organizational values that led them to pursue digital archiving. They had common concerns about who should be involved in digital archiving projects and how it should be accomplished. There were some interesting parallels in the decision making process within each organization. In this presentation, each of the panelists discussed how and why they came to their decisions, and how they all relied on the CLIR report, E-Journal Archiving Metes and Bounds, 1 to measure their progress and determine the next steps.

AB  - The increasing need for organizations to keep a high level of synchronization around the world and the coming of new advancements are pushing increasingly more to move decision-making and operational power from the focus of associations to their edges. The blockchain could be the critical innovation to roll out this improvement conceivable. A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Blockchain is pleased with the fact that it provides high satisfaction and a trust bond to its users. Data immutability, decentralization, anonymity, auditability, and transparency are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. This paper presents a study of blockchain technology to provide a comprehensive analysis that includes types, architecture, components, characteristics, and applications of blockchain.

AB  - The aim of the present article was to investigate, through a literature analysis, how contemporary modes of production impact univer-sity presses considering the social, political and economic contexts. The methodological approach consisted of two stages of collec-tion from the Web of Science database: in the first stage we retrieved 42 items related to changes in university presses over the last few years. In the second stage we analyzed 62 papers, related to information technology, refined from the concept of open access as a socio-technical concept. Five categories were selected for the content analysis of the papers: a) publishing market; b) dynamics of publisher; c) interaction with libraries; d) science communication, e) copyright. As the result, we discuss the advantages and potential of open access literature as of 2000, as well as the challenges for ideal, unrestricted and unlimited access to the intellectual production. We argue that further studies should focus on public and private relations, restricted access or open access, production resources, market, book prices, relations of publishing houses and other entities, institutions or companies, treatment of copyright, rep-resentation of society, committees and editorial boards.

AB  - Today, one can observe shifts in the research landscape, which is formed by digitization and open science principles. The open science movement continues to gain momentum, attention and debate. In parallel with the principle of unity, open science gives rise to a taxonomy of several related ideas, guidelines and concepts, such as open access, open replicable research and open data. Over the past fifteen years, research institutions have focused on open access to publications. However, recently the focus of attention has shifted to research data as a “new currency” in research activities and their distribution in open access, and the guiding principles of data management are becoming crucial for the wide implementation of open science practices and the effective use of data in research, industry, business and other sectors of the economy. In this context, it is relevant to carry out a thorough study of primary scientific works on open science issues and to study the role of the concept of “open research data” in the paradigm of a holistic ecosystem of open science and business ecosystem. In this work, it is proposed to use the methods of quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis, which allows to identify the main trends and form the basis for further research. The information base for this work was the international scientometric database Scopus, which enables to analyze bibliographic data using built-in tools and import them for external use in the VOSviewer software. The study revealed an increasing trend in the number of publications on the subject under study, with the highest annual growth rate in 2017 (76%) and 2019 (66%). Qualitative bibliographic analysis made it possible to analyze the most cited and, therefore, trending works on the selected topic. In terms of the number of citations per year, the results show that the studies with such directions in open science as open program code (open source); data/research reproducibility, research data management; open access to publications (open access) are most popular. In addition, a cluster analysis of the co-prevalence of keywords was conducted. It formed clusters dedicated to both institutional and infrastructural problems of the development of open science and research data. Separately, the results of the analysis create a scientific basis for further research into the key determinants of the effectiveness of the implementation of a proper research data management system at the micro, meso, and macro levels. It will improve the effectiveness of the implementation of scientific developments from one field of knowledge to another, while achieving increased interdisciplinary research. In parallel with this, interested persons of the real sector of the economy get the opportunity to analyze scientific results, determining the possibility of their adoption in their own activities.

AB  - Journal publishing has evolved and changed considerably over the years, leaving many libraries to grapple with analyzing and identifying the purpose and scope of these collections. After numerous discussions and an analysis of how the current print journal collection was being used, Kraemer Family Library at the University of Colorado–Colorado Springs decided to withdraw over 50% of the library’s print journal holdings in order to create a collaborative space for students. This article begins with an overview of journal publishing as it relates to academic libraries and the impact of electronic serials on the scope and purpose of a print journal collection. It then highlights the steps used to complete the project, and communication goals and methods employed to keep library staff members, faculty on campus, and other constituents aware of the changes taking place in the library.

AB  - Trust is a core component of collaboration. Trust is a local phenomenon, and scientific research is a global collaborative, its impact multiplied through open exchange, communication and mobility of people and information. Given the diversity of participants, local policies and cultures, how can trust be established in and between research communities? You need transparent governance processes, thoughtful engagement of stakeholder groups, and open and durable information sharing to build the "stickiness" needed. In this paper we illustrate these concepts through three trust building use cases: ORCID, Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, and SeamlessAccess, platforms sharing an identity and access technical service core, painstaking community building, and transparent governance frameworks.

AB  - (1) Background: Open access to scholarly works is globally recognized as a goal to be achieved as soon as possible; however, there is not yet a general understanding of how to achieve open access for books. In considering the most appropriate models of transition, an accurate and detailed insight into national and regional specifics can be of great importance. The aim of this research is to show the current state of scholarly book publishing in Croatia: recognising the key stakeholders, their characteristics, and the current level of open access to scholarly books. (2) Methods: The existing data from two different sources were used: the data about the public subsidies for book publishers by the Ministry of Science and Education and the data on published books from the Croatian Scientific Bibliography CROSBI, both for the period from 2018 to 2021. (3) Results: In the four-year period, 224 Croatian publishers were awarded subsidies to publish 2359 book titles. The majority of the publishers received support for only a small number of titles and relatively low amounts of subsidies. More than half of the titles are published by small private commercial publishers. However, the uptake of digital publishing among commercial publishers is very modest. Open access to scholarly books is almost entirely in the domain of non-commercial publishers. Most open access titles are available on the websites of their publishers. (4) Conclusions: The analysis of the data from these two sources have resulted in an overview of the current state of book publishing in Croatia. Such an overview provides a good basis for designing future measures and creating a national open science plan and can also be a useful contribution to international discussions.

AB  - Despite promising outcomes in higher education, the widespread adoption of learning analytics remains elusive in various educational settings, with primary and secondary schools displaying considerable reluctance to embrace these tools. This hesitancy poses a significant obstacle, particularly given the prevalence of educational technology and the abundance of data generated in these environments. In contrast to higher education institutions that readily integrate learning analytics tools into their educational governance, high schools often harbor skepticism regarding the tools’ impact and returns. To overcome these challenges, this work aims to harness learning analytics to address critical areas, such as school dropout rates, the need to foster student collaboration, improving argumentation and writing skills, and the need to enhance computational thinking across all age groups. The goal is to empower teachers and decision makers with learning analytics tools that will equip them to identify learners in vulnerable or exceptional situations, enabling educational authorities to take suitable actions that are aligned with students’ needs; this could potentially involve adapting learning processes and organizational structures to meet the needs of students. This work also seeks to evaluate the impact of such analytics tools on education within a multi-dimensional and scalable domain, ranging from individual learners to teachers and principals, and extending to broader governing bodies. The primary objective is articulated through the development of a user-friendly AI-based dashboard for learning. This prototype aims to provide robust support for teachers and principals who are dedicated to enhancing the education they provide within the intricate and multifaceted social domain of the school.

AB  - This review of 2004 and 2005 serials literature covers the themes of cost, management, and access. Interwoven through the serials literature of these two years are the importance of collaboration, communication, and linkages between scholars, publishers, subscription agents and other intermediaries, and librarians. The emphasis in the literature is on electronic serials and their impact on publishing, libraries, and vendors. In response to the crisis of escalating journal prices and libraries' dissatisfaction with the Big Deal licensing agreements, Open Access journals and publishing models were promoted. Libraries subscribed to or licensed increasing numbers of electronic serials. As a result, libraries sought ways to better manage licensing and subscription data (not handled by traditional integrated library systems) by implementing electronic resources management systems. In order to provide users with better, faster, and more current information on and access to electronic serials, libraries implemented tools and services to provide A to Z title lists, title by title coverage data, MARC records, and OpenURL link resolvers.

AB  - This article describes recent attempts to formalise relationships between the university sector in Australia, and equivalent bodies in the UK and the USA, in the development of information infrastructure through the creation of international liaison positions. The article provides a historical overview for collaborative activity of this kind, and gives an organisational perspective on the current developments. It describes the process by which potential issues for international collaboration were selected, discusses the opportunities for collaboration in each ‐‐ library purchasing consortia, subject‐based information gateways, mirroring of databases, authentication systems, and the scholarly communications crisis ‐‐ and reports on progress with those issues. The strengths and weaknesses of this formal, nation‐to‐nation approach are also discussed.

AB  - In 2011 the University of Wollongong Library undertook a significant review of its Resource Sharing services. This was prompted by constraints in the systems supporting this service, changes to the Library's key suppliers, Infotrieve Australia and the British Library Document Supply Service, and the need to deliver effective library services within a defined physical and budgetary environment.As a result of the review, the existing Millennium Interlibrary Loan and Ariel software hosting the service were replaced by the Relais ILL system. The most cost-effective and relevant methods for supporting the research needs of the university were achieved through subscriptions with networks characterized by strong unmediated requesting functionalities, including ArticleReach, BONUS+, and RapidILL. To expand the Library's access to international collections, a subscription to OCLC WorldCat Resource Sharing was begun.UOW Library now processes approximately 50% more requests, 76% of which are now processed to some degree without library staff mediation.

AB  - Los repositorios digitales de producción científica son espacios que conservan la información de las diversas publicaciones almacenadas donde los metadatos juegan un papel fundamental para el cumplimiento de dicho propósito. Al describir a los recursos en términos de su contenido, utilización, características técnicas, etc., permiten su catalogación y, por ende, facilitan su localización, su recuperación y su uso. Sin embargo, los metadatos suelen adolecer de integridad, completitud, exactitud y consistencia. En este trabajo se propone desarrollar un asistente que facilite la generación de metadatos para los recursos almacenados en el repositorio DSpace utilizando técnicas de extracción de conocimiento. Se espera que las técnicas de extracción de conocimiento puedan facilitar y mejorar la generación de metadatos para trabajos de titulación almacenados en el repositorio DSpace, beneficiando especialmente a los usuarios no especializados en esta área. Otro resultado será una API basada en el modelo arquitectónico que facilite la generación automática de metadatos para los documentos almacenados en DSpace.&#x0D; The digital repositories of scientific production are spaces that preserve the information of the various stored publications where metadata play a fundamental role for the fulfillment of said purpose. By describing resources in terms of their content, use, technical characteristics, etc., they allow their cataloging and, therefore, facilitate their location, retrieval and use. However, metadata often suffers from completeness, completeness, accuracy, and consistency. In this work it is proposed to develop a wizard that facilitates the generation of metadata for the resources stored in the DSpace repository using knowledge extraction techniques. It is expected that knowledge extraction techniques can facilitate and improve the generation of metadata for titling works stored in the DSpace repository, especially benefiting users not specialized in this area. Another result will be an API based on the architectural model that facilitates the automatic generation of metadata for documents stored in DSpace.

AB  - En este artículo se describe y analiza el desarrollo socio-tecnológico del Repositorio Institucional (RI) de la Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos (UNER, Argentina) durante el período 2015-2019. El estudio forma parte de un proyecto de investigación más amplio, enfocado en una variedad de estrategias y prácticas institucionales destinadas a promover la comunicación científica y el acceso abierto al conocimiento. Desde la perspectiva de los Estudios Sociales de la Tecnología, se concibe a los RI como dispositivos complejos, en cuyo diseño e implementación se articulan soportes y artefactos técnicos, decisiones institucionales, normativas, hábitos culturales, prácticas de uso, afinidades, intereses y disputas entre grupos sociales. Mediante un abordaje metodológico cualitativo -basado en fuentes documentales, entrevistas en profundidad y grupos focales de discusión- se logró identificar un conjunto de potencialidades y dificultades presentes en la estrategia difusionista adoptada por la UNER en el desarrollo de su repositorio digital. Si bien ello permitió cumplir con los requerimientos legales y tecnológicos externos, el análisis muestra que en el proceso se soslayaron las necesidades, prácticas y hábitos de los diversos tipos de agentes internos involucrados –dimensiones clave para la apropiación grupal y la sostenibilidad socio-técnica de un RI.

AB  - This paper describes our vision for the new UTS Library opening in 2016/17. Preparations are currently focussed on implementing enabling technologies which will move up to 80% of the print collection to an automated storage and retrieval system. This will allow the physical library to shift from a space dominated by book storage to a vibrant space for people, and facilitate better integration of physical and digital collections, services and spaces. While underpinned by technology, our new library is about people, and this paper describes the co-design practices we are exploring to include our clients in the planning process and ensure we deliver library services which meet their needs.

AB  - Library faculty at the City University of New York (CUNY) have engaged in promoting and advocating for open access publishing at each of our campuses as well as across the University. Inspired by the passing of a faculty senate resolution in support of the creation of an open access institutional repository and associated policies, many CUNY librarians felt the need to raise their level of commitment. In this article, the authors—four library faculty members and one faculty member from outside the library—share their experiences creating and approving open access policies in the library departments of four CUNY schools and promoting open access beyond the libraries. They offer practical advice and guidance for other librarians and faculty seeking to encourage the embrace of open access publishing in departments or other sub-institutional contexts.

AB  - Academic libraries have recently seen a shift from self-management of user-authentication of licensed resources themselves, to cloud-based implementations of "federated identity" technologies. Such technologies aim to solve the problems of fragile access to licensed resources while also better protecting publishers' intellectual property. However, federated identity systems raise a host of issues regarding privacy, surveillance, machinic subjection, and algorithmic governance. This paper traces the development of federated identity systems out of earlier authentication processes, shows how such systems use artificial intelligence techniques to create a trackable "data body" for each student, and then analyzes this whole procedure through the critical theories of Maurizio Lazzarato and Bernard Stiegler. In conclusion, the article argues that the emergent nature of the "data body" creates ambiguity between the hyper-control of contemporary technologies and the possibility of resisting them.

AB  - Abstract In this paper we investigate the definitions of perpetual access and examine current studies on the attitudes and concerns towards perpetual access from both libraries and publishers separately. We then conduct a content analysis of 72 e-journal licenses to explore whether perpetual access clauses vary among commercial publishers and non-commercial publishers, whether clauses change over time, and whether differences exist between consortium and site licenses. Results suggest that different perpetual access clauses may be at different stages of institutionalization. Perpetual access clauses that are more institutionalized include: addressing perpetual access in license, providing perpetual access upon expiry of subscription, and specifying a location for perpetual access.

AB  - Both commercial and noncommercial publishing have impacted interlibrary loan and other types of resource sharing, such as patrondriven systems, in a variety of ways. Interlibrary loan has always been a concern of publishers, with the possibility libraries would copy in "such aggregate quantities as to substitute for a subscription to or purchase" of a work (CONTU 1978). Exceptions and limits have been in place in the law and as guidelines for library copying for patrons and interlibrary loan since 1978. However, over the past five decades or so, as traditional print publications, electronic "Big Deals," licensing, and permissions have become increasingly unsustainable for library budgets, the open access (OA) movement has gained acceptance and has influenced resource sharing as well. OA materials are being used to fulfill resource-sharing requests, and researcher behavior may bypass traditional means of resource sharing altogether for greater speed and ease of access. Traditional publishing has found itself at a crossroads with the need to adapt as researchers increasingly accept new models of scholarly communication. There are plenty of moving parts in resource sharing today, and these are explored herein.

AB  - Recent reports on Australia's research infrastructure have highlighted the decline in serial subscriptions in academic and research libraries during the 1990s. They have used the annual CAUL statistics in order to support these claims. This article examines the CAUL statistics for serial subscriptions, indicating their numerous flaws when used for longitudinal analysis. Alternative interpretations of the statistics are given, which provide some evidence that rates of subscriptions to print periodicals were sustained for a longer period than previous uses of the data have suggested.

AB  - This article presents a case study for transitioning library-led open-educational resources (OER) initiatives away from labor-intensive activities to a model where library personnel focus on project management responsibilities. This shift from labour-intensive activities, such as workshops and training sessions, led to more collaborative partnerships with faculty and students to produce OER projects. In particular, we focus on labour implications for the various stakeholders involved and the sustainability of these initiatives. We describe several initiatives undertaken by the Ohio University Libraries to encourage open educational resource adoptions and projects, including a grant-funded initiative to provide support services for faculty creating OER. That funding, which was awarded to enhance undergraduate education, has been used to support the development of five OER projects that have directly involved students in the creation of those materials. We provide an overview of the various ways in which students have become involved in OER creation in partnership with faculty and librarians and discuss the impact these partnerships have had on student-faculty-librarian relationships and student engagement. Among these projects are an Hispanic linguistics open textbook created using only student-authored texts, student-generated test banks to accompany existing OER materials for a large-enrollment art history course, and several other projects in which hired student assistants are helping faculty to develop content for open textbooks. This article helps to address a gap in the literature by providing transparency regarding the personnel, costs, and workflow for Ohio University Libraries’ OER initiatives and addressing potential areas of concern surrounding student labour.

AB  - The paper investigates the causal link between remittances and economic growth in Romania. Starting from the debates regarding the relative contribution of international migrants’ remittances to sustainable economic development, this paper proposes an econometric analysis of the effects of remittances on the Romanian economy. The article shows that remittances have a positive effect on the current account of external balance of payments and they can replace external financial assistance flows, including foreign loans. Significant inflows of remittances can offset the current account deficit of the balance of payments, reducing the likelihood balance of payments crisis. At the same time remittances will increase aggregate demand, which has the effect of increasing inflation, currency appreciation and widening trade deficit. We showed also that remittances can exert positive influences on the process of investment, especially through the creation of numerous small enterprises.

AB  - Open Science is widely regarded as a culture that is characterised by the transparency and broad accessibility of scholarly work, where researchers share openly artefacts almost immediately and with a very wide audience. The overarching aim of this paper is to document the systematic development of a European postgraduate programme on Open Science and Research Data Management developed by the TRAINRDM project. TRAINRDM is a 30-month European Union funded project, which aims to develop a training network around Open Science and Research Data Management. We have applied a comprehensive survey collecting 239 responses from researchers across Europe, representative of 2.58 million individuals i.e. the total number of researchers employed in the EU-27 region. We then mapped out existing skills and offerings at different TRAINRDM partner institutions to produce a fully-online postgraduate programme with micro-credentials, fully distributed delivery, and compliance to FAIR principles to address academic and industrial research needs. The main outputs of the project are a training programme for Early Career Researchers delivered in Summer 2022, and a the postgraduate programme (Master degree) to be fully validated under the European Qualifications Framework at Level 7 and delivered in 2023. The TRAINRDM curricula, teaching materials, data, and software are openly released under CC BY 4.0 and GPL licenses.

AB  - Open science is considered a new science paradigm to make research accessible, accountable, and effective. Open science is already changing the academic profession starting from micro-practices to professional relations with epistemic communities and stakeholders, with implications that we are not yet able to predict. The article delves first into literature and official documentation to unfold the discursive regimes which sustain the spread of open science. A specific focus is then devoted to the professional transition, highlighting the role of funding organizations in setting the new science environment and the subjective experience of academics. The article is completed by a case study in the field of Research Data Management where the misalignment among incumbent/changing processes can be more apparent. Finally, a research agenda that focuses on how academic micro-practices are affecting organizations and science structures is proposed. This article aims at beginning to plow the ground for new research directions to emerge.

AB  - While Internet technologies have provided social networks for researchers as more open means to make their work available to other scholars, the traditionally closed, peer review-based publishing process has remained nearly untouched. We ask researchers about their intention to go one step further and use social peer review (SPR), which enables them to directly publish their work within a web-based social network, where, instead of the traditional pre-publication peer review, it can be evaluated and critiqued by the entire academic community. Based on a sample of 1429 international scholars from various fields and by drawing upon adoption and institutional theory, this study seeks to identify scientists' motivational drivers for engaging in this new forms of scholarly communication. We find that the adoption of SPR is driven more by extrinsic factors than by researchers' intrinsic motivation or normative influences to make science more open. Further challenges for SPR are low scores on the most relevant performance criteria, as well as low acceptance by established scientists. However, rather than a substitute, SPR is well perceived as a possible supplement to the traditional peer-based review system.

AB  - The rapid advancements in technology have opened up new doors for both teachers and students to explore, learn, and create in innovative ways. However, this progress has also brought forth new challenges and complexities that demand a deeper understanding of the use of technology in art education. In this context, bibliometric analysis has emerged as a potent tool to examine emerging trends in the intersection of technology and art education. Employing the PRISMA approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) and utilizing relevant Scopus databases with standardized procedures that ensure comprehensiveness and replicability, this bibliometric study identified 29 articles. The number of published articles in 2022, at 12, exceeded that of 2021, with only 6. Furthermore, the study highlighted the top 10 countries conducting research in technology and art education, with China having 17 studies, followed by the United States with 3 and Australia with 2. The top three keywords in current research trends are Education Computing, with 9 publications, E-learning, with 8, and Virtual Reality, with 7. Other keywords that relate to technology and art education are also pertinent to the research. These findings suggest that there is a growing interest in utilizing innovative research techniques to examine the intersection of technology and art education. As emerging technologies broaden the horizons of art-making and learning, they offer new avenues for creativity and innovation, but they also demand careful consideration of their potential benefits and risks. Educators and researchers will need to work in tandem to design effective strategies for integrating these technologies in ways that encourage creativity, learning, and social justice.

AB  - This case study will describe the labor and collaborative efforts to-date made by an embedded librarian to pilot an OER textbook creation and/or adoption program in her liaison area—a school of education serving approximately 850 graduate and 150 undergraduates at a private Catholic university on the West Coast. This case study will explore the initial project goals, successes (e.g., administrative support and graduate student enthusiasm), and challenges (e.g., faculty buy-in, unbalanced labor, OER creation support) encountered in this project. The study will also discuss the librarian’s professional development undertakings in effort to fill OER creation and platform knowledge gaps. Finally, the study will discuss the librarian’s next steps for this project in the upcoming academic year.

AB  - Abstract The increasing centrality of persistent identifiers (PIDs) to scholarly ecosystems and the contribution they can make to the burgeoning “PID graph” has the potential to transform scholarship. Despite their importance as originators of PID data, little is known about researchers’ awareness and understanding of PIDs, or their efficacy in using them. In this article, we report on the results of an online interactive test designed to elicit exploratory data about researcher awareness and understanding of PIDs. This instrument was designed to explore recognition of PIDs (e.g. Digital Object Identifiers [DOIs], Open Researcher and Contributor IDs [ORCIDs], etc.) and the extent to which researchers correctly apply PIDs within digital scholarly ecosystems, as well as measure researchers’ perceptions of PIDs. Our results reveal irregular patterns of PID understanding and certainty across all participants, though statistically significant disciplinary and academic job role differences were observed in some instances. Uncertainty and confusion were found to exist in relation to dominant schemes such as ORCID and DOIs, even when contextualized within real-world examples. We also show researchers’ perceptions of PIDs to be generally positive but that disciplinary differences can be noted, as well as higher levels of aversion to PIDs in specific use cases and negative perceptions where PIDs are measured on an “activity” semantic dimension. This work therefore contributes to our understanding of scholars’ “PID literacy” and should inform those designing PID-centric scholarly infrastructures that a significant need for training and outreach to active researchers remains necessary.

Es werden vier Dimensionen des Konzepts der Offenheit von Wissenschaft unterschieden: freier Zugang, öffentliche Kommunikation, offene Kooperation und die Überwindung gesellschaftlicher Subsysteme. Es wird des Weiteren eine sinnvolle Abgrenzung des Untersuchungsgegenstandes Open Science vorgeschlagen, die bei einer TA‑Studie berücksichtigt werden müsste. Nach einer kurzen Darstellung des Status Quo für drei typische Konkretisierungen von Open Science (Open Access, Open-Peer-Review, Wissenschaftsnetzwerke) werden vier Szenarien der zukünftigen Entwicklung von Open Science zur Diskussion gestellt.

AB  - Publishing has transited from traditional to Electronic format making information resources available to users without much subscription. E-publishing is engendered by the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT), this development has brought about increase in the number of scholarly communication in circulation. The awareness and rate of e-publishing differs among faculties, it based on this that this study was carried out to survey the situation of e-publishing and open access of librarians in three federal universities in Southern Nigeria, five research questions were formulated to guide the study. The methodology adopted is descriptive survey, questionnaire was given to a total population of 64 librarians consisting of librarians from the institutions understudy, the data collected from the study shows that though librarians are aware of e-publishing but they have not being publishing as should have been expected in University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) out of the 95% that aware of electronic publishing only 30% have published there articles electronically, in University of Lagos (UNILAG) 100% indicated that they have published electronically while in University of Benin (UNIBEN) 45.4% percent indicated yes while 54.5% said they have not published their articles electronically. On availability of open access it was discovered that they have access as a total of 84% from UNN responded Yes, UNILAG 100% said Yes while in UNIBEN 90.9%. The following problems based on their scoring militating against e-publishing and open access in Nigeria. Inadequate power supply; inadequate computer terminals; inadequate funding for subscription payment.

AB  - Resumo Publicações eletrônicas, apesar dos avanços das Tecnologias da Informação, são ainda calcados no modelo impresso. O formato textual impede que programas possam ser usados para o processamento “semântico” desses conteúdos. È porposto um modelo “semântico” de publicações cientificas eletrônicas, no qual as conclusões contidas no texto do artigo fornecidas por autores e representadas em formato “inteligível” por programas, permitindo recuperação semântica, identificação de indícios de novas descobertas científicas e de incoerências sobre este conhecimento. O modelo se baseia nos conceitos de estrutura profunda, ou semântica, da linguagem (CHOMSKY, 1975), de microestrutura, macroestrutura e superestrutura, (KINTSH, VAN DIJK, 1972), na estrutura retórica de artigos científicos (HUTCHINS, 1977), (GROSS, 1990) e nos elementos de metodologia cientifica, como problema, questão, objetivo, hipótese, experimento e conclusão. Resulta da análise de 89 artigos biomédicos. Foi desenvolvido um protótipo de sistema que implementa parcialmente o modelo. Questionários foram usados com autores para embasar o desenvolvimento do protótipo. O protótipo foi testando com pesquisadores-autores. Foram identificados quatro padrões de raciocínio e encadeamento dos elementos semânticos em artigos científicos. O modelo de conteúdo foi implementado como uma ontologia computacional. Foi desenvolvido e avaliado um protótipo de uma interface web de submissão artigos pelos autores a um sistema eletrônico de publicação de periódicos que implementa o modelo.Palavras-chave publicações eletrônicas; metodológica científica; comunicação científica; representação do conhecimento; ontologias; processamento semântico de conteúdos; e-CiênciaAbstract Electronic publishing, although Information Technologies advancements, are still based in the print text model. The textual format prevents programs to semantic process articles content. A semantic model of scientific electronic publishing is proposed, in which conclusion are prompted by author and recorded in machine-understandable format, enabling semantic retrieval, identification of traces of scientific discoveries and knowledge misunderstandings. The model is based on concepts as deep, or semantic, structure of human language (CHOMSKY, 1975), of microstructure, macrostructure and superstructure (KINTSH &amp; VAN DIJK, 1972), of rhetoric structure of scientific articles (HUTCHINS, 1977), (GROSS, 1990) and on scientific methodology semantic elements, such as problem, question, objective, hypothesis, experiment and conclusion. It results from analysis of 89 biomedical articles. A prototype system was developed which partially implements the model. Questionnaires with authors were used to test the prototype development. The prototype was also tested with several researchers-authors. Four patterns of reasoning and sequencing of semantic elements were identified in articles analyzed. The content model is implemented as a computational ontology. A prototype of a web author’s submission interface to a electronic journal system was developed and tested.Keywords electronic publishing, scientific methodology, scientific communication, knowledge representation, ontologies, semantic content processing, e-Science

AB  - This paper reviews the literature of collection development and management from 2009 and 2010. Themes and trends reflect the profound effect of environmental forces on libraries, including the economic recession, changes in scholarly communication, and an increasingly networked environment. Libraries reduced print collections and moved them to storage or shared repositories and assessed collections to find efficiencies and demonstrate value. Research libraries moved away from collecting everything toward mission-focused collecting, with an emphasis on unique collections. Collaboration across libraries, within institutions, and with nonlibrary partners continued as a key management strategy. Libraries shifted from a just-in-case to a just-in-time approach to collection development, and subject specialists identified new areas of responsibility, such as data curation.

AB  - Web Presence of Repositories of Indian Institutes of Technology: A Webometric Study Dr. Babita Jaiswal, Richa Arya Abstract Links weave web documents together in a complex, structured hypertext corpus. Web links studies have been conducted by the scholars and information professionals all over the world since its introduction. The main objective of the study is to investigate the web presence of repositories of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) as a part of the World Wide Web. To investigate the web presence the few sub-objectives have been framed such as to identify IITs which are having their repositories; to find out the TLD, cc TLD and file formats use by the repositories; to find out total number of Web Pages, Link Web Pages, Self Link Web Pages, External Link Web Pages and Inlink Web Pages; to calculate Overall Web Impact Factor, Simple Web Impact Factor, Self Link Web Impact Factor, External Link Web Impact Factor and Inlink Web Impact Factor. Google covers more hyperlinks with advanced search facilities to count links possessed by the websites. Therefore, the present study has used Google to collect raw data, i.e., number of web pages, number of inlinks, self links and external links etc. Boolean operators are also used to form query syntaxes for retrieving data. SocSciBot web crawler is also employed. It is used to create network map of all the websites. URLs/websites of repositories are tested through command line textual queries like link, linkdomain, site, etc. Findings have been derived after analyzing the data.

AB  - Knowledge graph (KG) schema, which prescribes a high-level structure and semantics of a KG, is significantly helpful for KG completion and reasoning problems. Despite its usefulness, open-domain KGs do not practically have a unified and fixed schema. Existing approaches usually extract schema information using entity types from a KG where each entity e can be associated with a set of types {Te, by either heuristically taking one type for each entity or exhaustively combining the types of all entities in a fact (to get entity-typed tuples, (h_type, r, t_type) for example). However, these two approaches either overlook the role of multiple types of a single entity across different facts or introduce non-negligible noise as not all the type combinations actually support the fact, thus failing to capture the sophisticated schema information. Against this background, we study the problem of modeling hyper-relational schema, which is formulated as mixed hyper-relational tuples ({Th}, r, {Tt}, k, {Tv1},...) with two-fold hyper-relations: each type set T may contain multiple types and each schema tuple may contain multiple key-type set pairs (k, Tv). To address this problem, we propose HELIOS, a hyper-relational schema model designed to subtly learn from such hyper-relational schema tuples by capturing not only the correlation between multiple types of a single entity, but also the correlation between types of different entities and relations in a schema tuple. We evaluate HELIOS on three real-world KG datasets in different schema prediction tasks. Results show that HELIOS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hyper-relational link prediction techniques by 20.0-29.7%, and is also much more robust than baselines in predicting types and relations across different positions in a hyper-relational schema tuple.

AB  - In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have come into view as one of the most transformative developments in the technical domain, influencing diverse sectors ranging from natural language processing (NLP) to creative arts. Their rise signifies an unprecedented convergence of computational prowess, sophisticated algorithms, and expansive datasets, pushing the boundaries of what was once thought to be achievable. Such a profound impact mandates a thorough exploration of the LLMs’ evolutionary trajectory. Consequently, this article conducts a literature review of the most impactful scientific works, using the reliable Web of Science (WoS) indexing database as a data source in order to attain a thorough and quality-assured analysis. This review identifies relevant patterns, provides research insights, traces technological growth, and anticipates potential future directions. Beyond mapping the known, this study aims to highlight uncharted areas within the LLM landscape, thereby catalyzing future research endeavors. The ultimate goal is to enhance collective understanding, encourage collaboration, and guide subsequent innovations in harnessing the potential of LLMs for societal and technological advancement.

AB  - This study investigates the information seeking behavior of faculty and graduate students in the sciences of food and health. We compare three food science research sources through quantitative and qualitative research methods of interviews, observational studies, and surveys. We aimed to discover what motivates scientists’ information seeking, how they search, what barriers they experience, and how they critically evaluate information sources. We explored faculty perceptions of literature review practice in the field and by their students, their preferences for training and best practice in order to improve research quality. Recommendations for librarians supporting food science and related departments are provided.

AB  - Globally library cooperation and collaboration is transforming the scholarship landscape as academic libraries battle to survive amidst escalating costs of subscriptions. Zimbabwe is no exception to this phenomenon as evidenced by the development of local consortia for resource sharing. The main purpose of the research is to gather the views of librarians on the need for a library consortium to support national development in Zimbabwe. The researcher used a mixed method approach. Zimbabwe does not have national library consortium for nationwide access to information. Such a consortium is key to harnessing the collective buying power of member institutions to negotiate and guarantee license agreements for digital content. The study recommends a federated library consortium model built on lessons learned from other countries. The model elevates library consortium principles of cooperation and collaboration into Zimbabwe’s national development agenda.

AB  - Metadata harvesting requires timely propagation of up-to-date information from thousands of repositories over a wide area network. It is desirable to keep the data as fresh as possible while observing the overhead on the harvester. An important dimension to be considered is that repositories vary widely in their update patterns; they may experience different update rates at different times or unexpected changes to update patterns. In this paper, we define data freshness metrics and propose an adaptive algorithm for the synchronization of the harvester with the repositories. The algorithm is based on meeting a desired level of freshness while incurring the minimum overhead on the harvester. We present a comparison between different policies for the synchronization within the framework devised. It is shown that the proposed policy outperform the other policies, especially for heterogeneous update patterns.

AB  - Technical reports have always posed problems for libraries and librarians. They are often bibliographically inconsistent, difficult to source, and published to varying standards of quality. In some science and technical fields, these reports are also large in number and central in importance. Additionally, established workflows for acquiring and preserving technical reports in distributed repositories have been undermined by the transition from print to digital. Overall, the "grey literature" challenges librarians face have increased.

AB  - Wiki4R will create an innovative virtual research environment (VRE) for Open Science at scale, engaging both professional researchers and citizen data scientists in new and potentially transformative forms of collaboration.It is based on the realizations that (1) the structured parts of the Web itself can be regarded as a VRE, (2) such environments depend on communities, (3) closed environments are limited in their capacity to nurture thriving communities.Wiki4R will therefore integrate Wikidata, the multilingual semantic backbone behind Wikipedia, into existing research processes to enable transdisciplinary research and reduce fragmentation of research in and outside Europe.By establishing a central shared information node, research data can be linked and annotated into knowledge.Despite occasional uses of Wikipedia or Wikidata in research, significant barriers to broader adoption in the sciences or digital humanities exist, including lack of integration into existing research processes and inadequate handling of provenances.The proposed actions include providing best practices and tools for semantic mapping, adoption of citation and author identifiers, interoperability layers for integration with existing

AB  - The Publisher Application System (PAS) is a Web-based archiving and online evaluation system developed by the Database Evaluation Group (DEG), one of the working groups formed within the Anatolian University Libraries Consortium (ANKOS). The DEG was formed in 2008 to inquire and evaluate e-resources suited to the needs of the consortium; to follow up similar consortial activities worldwide as well as developments in connection with the scientific publishing industry; and to determine, implement, and improve pricing models in accordance with the prevailing economic, legal, and academic system. Development of the PAS was essential to ensure standardization and sustainability towards a more detailed and effective analysis of e-resources qualifying for evaluation by ANKOS. The PAS played an important part not only in establishing and defining the workflow of the DEG, but also in creating an archive of both the e-resources submitted to the consortium and the applicant publishers/agents submitting these resources. This article outlines the process that started with the foundation of the DEG through the formation of the PAS as well as the present setup of the system. It is also hoped that this case study will have a positive contribution to the processes being followed by the persons and the groups engaged in similar activities.

AB  - <ns7:p>Although FAIR Research Data Principles are targeted at and implemented by different communities, research disciplines, and research stakeholders (data stewards, curators, etc.), there is no conclusive way to determine the level of FAIRness intended or required to make research artefacts (including, but not limited to, research data) Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The FAIR Principles cover all types of digital objects, metadata, and infrastructures. However, they focus their narrative on data features that support their reusability. FAIR defines principles, not standards, and therefore they do not propose a mechanism to achieve the behaviours they describe in an attempt to be technology/implementation neutral. Various FAIR assessment metrics and tools have been designed to measure FAIRness. Unfortunately, the same digital objects assessed by different tools often exhibit widely different outcomes because of these independent interpretations of FAIR. This results in confusion among the publishers, the funders, and the users of digital research objects. Moreover, in the absence of a standard and transparent definition of what constitutes FAIR behaviours, there is a temptation to define existing approaches as being FAIR-compliant rather than having FAIR define the expected behaviours. This whitepaper identifies three high-level stakeholder categories -FAIR decision and policymakers, FAIR custodians, and FAIR practitioners - and provides examples outlining specific stakeholders' (hypothetical but anticipated) needs. It also examines possible models for governance based on the existing peer efforts, standardisation bodies, and other ways to acknowledge specifications and potential benefits. This whitepaper can serve as a starting point to foster an open discussion around FAIRness governance and the mechanism(s) that could be used to implement it, to be trusted, broadly representative, appropriately scoped, and sustainable.

AB  - Purpose- the purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the potential roles of librarians in institutional repositories in Kenya. Knowledge management practices and processes have roots in library practices anteceding institutional repositories. Thus, the library as an avenue for knowledge management can effectively become a physical or virtual place for open access and scholarly communication only if librarians' step outside traditional roles. Unfortunately, institutional repositories are not fully developed in some academic institutions. Unawareness of librarians of their roles, and being unskilled in implementing the institutional repository has been incriminated for this problem. Despite this, little has been explored to understand the roles of academic librarians in institutional repositories in higher learning institutions in developing countries.Design/methodology/approach- Using analytical method, this paper analyses and presented various the matical issues on Institutional Repositories in relation to the roles of librarians, while highlighting limitations and proposing solutions for its sustainability.Findings- the paper found that globally most universities have embraced IRS. However, the unawareness of librarians of their roles and low technical skills in the use of institutional repository has been incriminated for low visibility of research output notwithstanding the many research activities undertaken by universities. In fine the academic librarians have not played their roles in institutional repositories as extensive as expected.Originality/value: Despite the high uptake of IRs by higher learning's institutions, little has been documented on the role of librarians in the use of institutional repository.Implications: the review helps higher learning institutions and academic librarians to understand how academic librarians' roles have been transformed by the emergence of institutional repositories.

AB  - In 2000 the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was still in its early stages. It was often still called the Santa Fe Convention, which refers to a meeting in October 1999 of representatives from a number of institutions that maintained or planned e-print archives for open access, and from organizations interested in providing services on the data in those archives (such as search interfaces). This convention was an initiative of Paul Ginsparg, Rick Luce and Herbert Van de Sompel (all three working at that time at the Los Alamos National Laboratory) and it resulted in an agreement about a technical and organizational framework for achieving interoperability among e-print archives. The first European meeting on OAI took place in September 2000 in Lisbon, in conjunction with a meeting of the European Computer Driving Licence Foundation (ECDL), and therefore more oriented to computer specialists than to librarians.

AB  - This article presents a new framework for realizing the value of linked data understood as a strategic asset and increasingly necessary form of infrastructure for policy-making and research in many domains. We outline a framework, the 'data mosaic' approach, which combines socio-organizational and technical aspects. After demonstrating the value of linked data, we highlight key concepts and dangers for community-developed data infrastructures. We concretize the framework in the context of work on science and innovation generally. Next we consider how a new partnership to link federal survey data, university data, and a range of public and proprietary data represents a concrete step toward building and sustaining a valuable data mosaic. We discuss technical issues surrounding linked data but emphasize that linking data involves addressing the varied concerns of wide-ranging data holders, including privacy, confidentiality, and security, as well as ensuring that all parties receive value from participating. The core of successful data mosaic projects, we contend, is as much institutional and organizational as it is technical. As such, sustained efforts to fully engage and develop diverse, innovative communities are essential.

AB  - Ensuring the reproducibility of research is a multi-stakeholder effort that comes with challenges and opportunities for individual researchers and research communities, librarians, publishers, funders and service providers. These emerge at various steps of the research process, and, in particular, at the publication stage. Previous work by Knowledge Exchange highlighted that, while there is growing awareness among researchers, reproducible publication practices have been slow to change. Importantly, research reproducibility has not yet reached institutional agendas: this work seeks to highlight the rationale for libraries to initiate and/or step up their engagement with this topic, which we argue is well aligned with their core values and strategic priorities. We draw on secondary analysis of data gathered by Knowledge Exchange, focusing on the literature identified as well as interviews held with librarians. We extend this through further investigation of the literature and by integrating the findings of discussions held at the 2022 LIBER conference, to provide an updated picture of how libraries engage with research reproducibility. Libraries have a significant role in promoting responsible research practices, including transparency and reproducibility, by leveraging their connections to academic communities and collaborating with stakeholders like research funders and publishers. Our recommendations for libraries include: i) partnering with researchers to promote a research culture that values transparency and reproducibility, ii) enhancing existing research infrastructure and support; and iii) investing in raising awareness and developing skills and capacities related to these principles.

AB  - With the worldwide growth in the number of repositories, the international directories, such as OpenDOAR, become important mechanisms for enhancing the dissemination and visibility of stored contents. This study aimed to analyze the use of the criteria adopted by the directory OpenDOAR in relation to Luso-Brazilians institutional repositories. The data collection occurred from January to April 2013 through observations in OpenDOAR’s website and through emails exchange with the responsible team for the directory. Each one of the 91 Luso-Brazilians institutional repositories in the sample was checked manually in order to find out whether they comply with the established criteria for the registration in the directory. For this study, it was not questioned whether the use of the typology used to classify repositories was correct or whether it agreed with the specialized literature. The research detected that some of the criteria are violated, one of the reasons may be the lack of necessary information to understanding these criteria. Directories, such as OpenDOAR are responsible for gathering the open access initiatives. Therefore, the directories are important since they prove empirically the growth of the movement of open access to scientific information in the world.

AB  - Lay summarization aims to simplify complex scientific information for non-expert audiences. This paper investigates the trade-off between readability and relevance in the lay summarization of long biomedical documents. We introduce a two-stage framework that attains the best readability metrics in the first subtask of BioLaySumm 2023, with 8.924 FleschKincaid Grade Level and 9.188 DaleChall Readability Score. However, this comes at the cost of reduced relevance and factuality, emphasizing the inherent challenges of balancing readability and content preservation in lay summarization. The first stage generates summaries using a large language model, such as BART with LSG attention. The second stage uses a zero-shot sentence simplification method to improve the readability of the summaries. In the second subtask, a hybrid dataset is employed to train a model capable of generating both lay summaries and abstracts. This approach achieves the best readability score and shares the top overall rank with other leading methods. Our study underscores the importance of developing effective methods for creating accessible lay summaries while maintaining information integrity. Future work will integrate simplification and summary generation within a joint optimization framework that generates high-quality lay summaries that effectively communicate scientific content to a broader audience.

AB  - Academic libraries have always thought of “content” as their domain on campus. Yet beyond the course reserve desk, libraries have traditionally played a relatively small role on campus for the most common form of content in higher education, textbooks. Today, everything about textbooks and other course content is changing quickly. Spiraling costs have made textbooks a political issue in some states, while at the same time traditional textbook publishers experience economic pressures both from the growth of the used and rental markets and from new technological demands from the professors who assign their online books as well as from the students who use them. Librarians have begun to take notice, reversing course on the traditional library view of textbooks. A number of libraries are looking for more affordable ways for students to access textbooks. Many are leveraging open educational resources (OER) as alternatives to expensive, commercially-published textbooks. Other libraries have themselves become textbook publishers. This changed course has led librarians sometimes into new alliances and sometimes into degrees of conflict with other organizations, such as bookstores, commercial publishers, university presses, and aggregators.

AB  - Sedimentologika is a community-driven Diamond Open Access scientific journal for the publication of work in the broad area of sedimentology and stratigraphy. The journal aims to provide a platform to the academic community and broader society, offering and guaranteeing permanent free publication and free access to peer-reviewed scientific studies focusing on all types of sedimentary processes, deposits, and environments across all spatial and temporal scales, on Earth or any other planetary body. It will publish high-quality research that will advance the field of sedimentary science (through multidisciplinarity, new teaching practices, tools and methods, and progress in accessibility to science). Sedimentologika is part of an ongoing broader Diamond Open Access movement in geosciences aspiring freedom from the financial barriers and pressures of private publishing houses, to provide direct and equal access to science for all citizens, scientists, and institutions worldwide. The published material will include research, review, methodology and opinion articles, which will be free to share, as the authors will retain the copyright on all the submitted material. Manuscripts will be published in English. Authors can attach a second abstract in the language of their choice, further allowing local communities, students, or decisional bodies to access, at least, a summary of the latest research, thus reducing potential language barriers. Sedimentologika follows Open Science principles to promote ethical dissemination and accessibility of science and knowledge, following high equity, diversity and inclusion standards. Sedimentologika emerged as a solution for the scientific community to sidestep structural inequality of the academic publishing system that is becoming financially unsustainable to its payers (authors, funding agencies), and to commit to bibliodiversity. The objective is to ensure that scientific findings remain accessible to all in order to keep advancing research and informing society on how we understand sedimentology and stratigraphy in the world around us. Sedimentologika is driven by the academic and scientific community for the community and society, promoting self-governance and adapting to the needs expressed by the community.

AB  - Quantum key distribution – a process that encodes digital information – often utilises fibre optic technologies for commercial applications. Fibre provides the benefit of a dark channel as well as the convenience of independence of a line-of-sight connection between the sender and receiver. In order to implement quantum key distribution protocols utilising polarisation encoding, the birefringence effects of fibre must be compensated for. Birefringence is caused by manufacturing impurities in the fibre or a change in environmental conditions and results in a rotation of the state of polarisation of light as it is propagated through the fibre. With dynamic environmental conditions, the birefringence effects should be monitored with a test signal at regular time intervals so that the polarisation of each photon can be appropriately compensated to its original state. Orthogonal states are compensated simultaneously, but most protocols, such as BB84 and B92, require non-orthogonal basis sets. Instead of using a compensator for each basis, the presented scheme fixes the polarisation controller onto the plane on the Poincaré that passes through both bases, compensating both non-orthogonal bases simultaneously.

AB  - While most challenges organized so far in the Semantic Web domain are focused on comparing tools with respect to different criteria such as their features and competencies, or exploiting semantically enriched data, the Semantic Web Evaluation Challenges series, co-located with the ESWC Semantic Web Conference, aims to compare them based on their output, namely the produced dataset. The Semantic Publishing Challenge is one of these challenges. Its goal is to involve participants in extracting data from heterogeneous sources on scholarly publications, and producing Linked Data that can be exploited by the community itself. This paper reviews lessons learned from both (i) the overall organization of the Semantic Publishing Challenge, regarding the definition of the tasks, building the input dataset and forming the evaluation, and (ii) the results produced by the participants, regarding the proposed approaches, the used tools, the preferred vocabularies and the results produced in the three editions of 2014, 2015 and 2016. We compared these lessons to other Semantic Web Evaluation Challenges. In this paper, we (i) distill best practices for organizing such challenges that could be applied to similar events, and (ii) report observations on Linked Data publishing derived from the submitted solutions. We conclude that higher quality may be achieved when Linked Data is produced as a result of a challenge, because the competition becomes an incentive, while solutions become better with respect to Linked Data publishing best practices when they are evaluated against the rules of the challenge.

AB  - Cilj. Rad prikazuje knjižnične programe i usluge na daljinu Narodne knjižnice „Petar Preradović“ Bjelovar u doba epidemije COVID-19 u vremenu od 16. ožujka do 24. travnja 2020. godine kada je knjižnica bila fizički zatvorena za korisnike. Razmatra se problematika prilagodbe knjižnice na izvanredne situacije u kontekstu osmišljavanja i provođenju usluga na daljinu te komunikacija knjižnice sa svojim korisnicima na daljinu uporabom komunikacijskih medija i kanala zasnovanih na informacijsko-komunikacijskoj tehnologiji. Metodologija. Metodološki pristup temi ogleda se u istraživanju literature vezane za knjižnično poslovanje u kriznim situacijama te knjižničnim uslugama na daljinu. Bitna tema koju literatura pokriva odnosi se na medijsku komunikaciju knjižnica u kriznim situacijama. Ovaj rad sinteza je tog istraživanja, odnosno kritičkog promišljanja zadane teme uz primjere dobre prakse. Rezultati. Uvidom u relevantnu stručnu i znanstvenu literaturu te kroz primjere dobre prakse provedenih usluga na daljinu uočeno je da narodne knjižice mogu više-manje uspješno provoditi različite usluge koje ne zahtijevaju fizičko prisustvo korisnika u knjižničnom prostoru. Isto tako, te se usluge mogu još dodatno promovirati i razvijati u suradnji s lokalnom zajednicom te medijima, uz pomoć komunikacijskih kanala baziranih na informacijsko-komunikacijskoj tehnologiji. Vrijednost. Rad naglašava važnost prilagodbe knjižničnog poslovanja izvanrednim situacijama, u ovom slučaju epidemije COVID-19 , kako u teoriji, tako i u praksi. Isto tako, rad ističe primjere dobre prakse koji bi trebali poslužiti kao ogled drugim knjižničarima kao smjernice za osmišljavanja i provođenje usluga na daljinu.

AB  - Current approaches to plagiarism detection often focus on finding lexical matches rather than semantic similarities in the text content that is compared.But the more important unanswered questions remain whether similar concepts expressed in related topical contexts are semantically equivalent as idea-laundering plagiarism by humans or algorithm-generated plagiarism by machines.Now publicly available and easily accessible, text-generating algorithms have automated the process of assembling a text derived from but not attributed to published content scraped from the web.The FAIR Metrics, with FAIR an acronym for Fair Attribution to Indexed Reports and Fair Acknowledgment of Information Records, measure how appropriately a document cites prior records based on whether they contain similar claims that are equivalent in meaning.We demonstrate herein a workflow with results for manual evaluation of the FAIR Metrics to quantify the extent of plagiarism in 8 articles retracted or reported for plagiarism.We also demonstrate use of the Nexus-PORTAL-DOORS-Scribe (NPDS) Cyberinfrastructure to manage semantic descriptions of the concept mappings and entity equivalence evaluations made using concepts and relationships from the PDP-DREAM Ontology.

AB  - Computing technology has deeply shaped how academic articles are written and produced, yet article formats and affordances have changed little over centuries. The status quo consists of digital files optimized for printed paper—ill-suited to interactive reading aids, accessibility, dynamic figures, or easy information extraction and reuse. Guided by formative discussions with scholarly communication researchers and publishing tool developers, we present Living Papers, a language toolkit for producing augmented academic articles that span print, interactive, and computational media. Living Papers articles may include formatted text, references, executable code, and interactive components. Articles are parsed into a standardized document format from which a variety of outputs are generated, including static PDFs, dynamic web pages, and extraction APIs for paper content and metadata. We describe Living Papers' architecture, document model, and reactive runtime, and detail key aspects such as citation processing and conversion of interactive components to static content. We demonstrate the use and extension of Living Papers through examples spanning traditional research papers, explorable explanations, information extraction, and reading aids such as enhanced citations, cross-references, and equations. Living Papers is available as an extensible, open source platform intended to support both article authors and researchers of augmented reading and writing experiences.

Foi realizada busca no ROAR para levantar os repositórios brasileiros e no ROARMAP para identificar as políticas registradas por instituições brasileiras. Das 100 instituições brasileiras registradas no ROAR, 34 atendem ao critério de inclusão, porém somente três já efetuaram registro de suas políticas no ROARMAP, sejam elas: Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG) e Universidade de São Paulo (USP), a qual refere-se a teses. As políticas analisadas recomendam: o depósito das publicações científicas com revisão por pares (artigos de revistas, comunicações em conferências); disponibilização dos metadados imediatamente em Acesso Livre, respeitando períodos de embargo quando necessário; e incentivo para que o autor conserve a propriedade dos direitos autorais de suas publicações. Pode-se inferir que as políticas da UFRGS e FURG foram bem sucedidas, uma vez que os repositórios das mesmas são, respectivamente, o primeiro e o terceiro no ranking brasileiro em povoamento.

AB  - The present study aims to outline the profile of uncited or rarely cited articles indexed in the Web of Science database between 2017 and 2021. We used stratified random sampling of 14,425 journals to extract our study sample of 373 journals. The dependent variable was defined as the number of citations, with independent variables being the JCR index, maturity, quartile, language of publication, and whether the research was funded. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample according to field of research and variable. A negative binomial regression method was used to estimate which variables influence the number of citations received by articles in the sample. We found that of the 256,524 articles that make up the research corpus, 39,469 (15.39%) received no citations and 91,963 articles (35.85%) received up to four citations. The variables that positively influenced estimates of the number of citations were maturity (0.481), JCR index (0.159), and funding (0.020), while quartile (-0.170) and language (-1.032) had a negative influence on number of citations. We conclude that the pressures of academic productivism create a vicious cycle in which studies are referenced based on their ranking in the struggle for privileged editorial space, with articles in higher quartile journals being more prone to citation.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which teaching staff cooperated with librarians in collection development, specifically in relation to electronic resources, and to identify barriers they encountered while performing collection development activities. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods approach was adopted for the study. Quantitative and qualitative techniques of data collection and analysis were used to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the research topic. Data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire and interviews. A total of 149 faculty members completed the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 51.2%, while 16 library staff members were interviewed to obtain qualitative data. Findings The majority of the teaching staff who participated in the study affirmed that they had cooperated with subject librarians in collection development. A high percentage (62.4%) of the faculty members had collaborated with subject librarians in collection development activities. Only 37.6% of the faculty members had not participated in collection development activities with subject librarians to acquire library electronic resources. According to faculty members, some of the main challenges affecting collection development at the University of Namibia were a lack of catalogues for electronic resources and a lack of lists of titles from vendors. Moreover, librarians were not always available to assist faculty members. It is recommended that faculty members be part of the process of selecting materials and that a good relationship be fostered between librarians and faculty members to bring value to collection development activities. Originality/value Collection development in respect of electronic resources is a complex process to be undertaken by a single entity and, therefore, requires the collaboration of all stakeholders involved. In the case of institutions of higher learning, these stakeholders include faculty, librarians and vendors. The emergence of a variety of e-resources demands a meticulous strategy on the part of libraries to ensure they can offer a wide range of up-to-date and accurate resources that meet the evolving needs of their users. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, studies that are similar to this one have not been conducted in Namibia before. This case study presents useful findings and lessons on faculty–librarian cooperation for effective collection development, not only at the University of Namibia library but also at other academic libraries in economies with similar characteristics.

AB  - This Extended Editorial has been compiled by the members of the Editorial Board to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Journal of Integrated Design and Process Science, which operates as the Transactions of the Society for Process and Design Science. The paper divides in three parts. The first part provides a detailed overview of the preliminaries, the objectives, and the periods of operation. It also includes a summary of the current application-orientated professional fields of interests, which are: (i) convergence mechanisms of creative scientific disciplines, (ii) convergence of artificial intelligence, team and health science, (iii) convergence concerning next-generation cyber-physical systems, and (iv) convergence in design and engineering education. The second part includes invited papers, which exemplify domains within the four fields of interest, and also represent good examples of science communication. Short synopses of the contents of these representative papers are included. The third part takes the major changes in scientific research and the academic publication arena into consideration, circumscribes the mission and vision as formulated by the current Editorial Board, and elaborates on the planned strategic exploration and utilization domains of interest.

AB  - This paper discusses the technical infrastructure and production workflow for the University of Lethbridge Meeting of the Minds Graduate Journal. This infrastructure was designed for an editorial board that anticipated high annual turnover: very easy to understand and train for, able to accommodate differing levels of interest and commitment from year to year, and be “publish and forget”: the long term preservation and discoverability of articles published by the journal had to be ensured regardless of future generations of students’s willingness to support the journal.

AB  - La formación del profesor en ciencias experimentales se basa tradicionalmente en dos áreas relevantes, una disciplinar y otra didácticopedagógico. En la actualidad se ha incorporado una nueva visión del rol docente, centrado en un perfi l de profesor-investigador y sus hábitos de trabajo. Esta postura justifi ca la inclusión de asignaturas, seminarios, talleres y consultorías en su formación con enfoques teórico-práctico dirigidos a profundizar los métodos de investigación en la enseñanza de estas ciencias y refl exionar sobre sus diferentes aspectos. A pesar de la consolidación de este nuevo perfi l, podemos recapacitar y preguntarnos ¿por qué tenemos que incluir la investigación en la formación docente? A continuación resumiremos algunas de las motivaciones y necesidades que creemos imponen esta competencia a los docentes. En primer lugar, se trata de completar su perfi l con habilidades específi cas y el desarrollo de procedimientos y formas de pensamiento que se pueden transferir a sus estudiantes. Las exigencias de los nuevos modelos educativos requieren de innovaciones áulicas tendientes a cambiar y mejorar las estrategias de enseñanza y de aprendizaje y por consiguiente saber cómo resultan estas innovaciones, cuáles son los cambios que realmente ejercen y en qué procedimientos hacen hincapié. Estas son algunas de las cuestiones que se pueden averiguar y para obtener respuestas serias y fundadas es preciso investigar al respecto. En segundo término, cada día son más los parámetros de calidad que se imponen en los sistemas educativos y en la labor de los docentes. Es común que se midan las competencias adquiridas y que se establezcan puntajes o califi caciones de los docentes, de los materiales y de las instituciones. Todo ello puede ser investigado y es ineludible que toda acción educativa o cualquiera de sus aspectos, debieran ser fi ables y legitimadas por la investigación (Liston y Zeichner, 1993; Palladino, 1995).Para lograr una adecuación de la investigación en la formación docente generalmente se incorporan cursos de metodología de tipo tradicional, que presentan difi cultades para ser transferidos a las ciencias experimentales con propuestas ?recetarias? y separadas de los planteos de la enseñanza de las ciencias, creemos que es importante introducir estos cursos desde otra perspectiva, que profundice sobre las posturas de investigación y contribuya a refl exionar acerca de la concepción de ciencia que poseen los docentes. Otros tópicos importantes son la introducción de discusiones fi losófi cas y epistemológicas para superar algunas de las visiones actuales de ciencia forjadas fundamentalmente en el siglo XIX y XX. Es necesario fl exibilizar el concepto de método científi co y sus procedimientos con actividades acordes; equilibrar el valor de la innovación y la investigación para que sea una fuente de renovación y motivación; propiciar un diálogo activo con investigadores de la propia disciplina, de la educación en ciencias y con otros colegas.En todo proceso de investigación educativa se intenta ubicar el contexto general en donde se van a desarrollar las actividades investigativas, ya que esta labor está enmarcada en una situación sociohistórico que la condiciona (Latorre y González, 1992). También, resulta imprescindible el estudio de los marcos teóricos de las diferentes líneas de investigación específicamente vinculadas a la enseñanza de las ciencias. Para ello, se necesita realizar una profunda revisión de la literatura, lo que facilita la formulación de una hipótesis o establecer una pregunta o problema a resolver. Hasta hace poco tiempo las fuentes bibliográfi cas con que se contaba para buscar los antecedentes eran sólo materiales, ya sean libros o revistas, que estaban en formato papel. Hoy en día, la aparición de Internet y el crecimiento en la difusión del conocimiento han provocado un cambio revolucionario en las publicaciones y por consiguiente en la forma de acceder a estas fuentes. Sin embargo, a pesar de que las facilidades tecnológicas han aumentado enormemente, resulta difícil llevar a cabo una buena búsqueda no sólo por las restricciones económicas respecto al acceso de los artículos impuestas a través de las editoriales, sino por la escasa formación dada a los docentes para desarrollar estas habilidades.Los planes de estudio y las asignaturas de los profesorados en ciencias experimentales, están lejos de incorporar estos conocimientos y dada la importancia de la investigación y su escritura como una nueva dimensión del rol docente, es que nos planteamos este trabajo. Sus objetivos están centrados en identifi car y caracterizar fuentes de información útiles para la investigación usando medios electrónicos, conocer las características de la escritura científi ca, sus procesos de revisión, como así mismo, refl exionar acerca de la importancia de la investigación y de su escritura.El acceso a nuevas fuentes de informaciónSon variadas las fuentes que se pueden consultar para obtener antecedentes en una investigación, tales como libros, artículos científi cos, tesis de maestría y doctorado, ponencias en congresos, informes, monografías, entre otras, las que pueden ser de primera o segunda mano. La distinción de estas fuentes para Ecco (1997) consiste en que la obra estudiada sea de una edición original y es lapidario al respeto cuando señala que ?lo que no se ha de hacer jamás es citar una fuente de segunda mano fi ngiendo haber visto el original? y que las publicaciones redundantes son consideradas poco éticas.Cada día se encuentran más publicaciones de libre acceso en Internet, pero muchas veces no sabemos si estas fuentes son válidas y cuáles serían las características que debemos considerar a la hora de su selección. En el caso de los artículos, tiene que ver con quiénes son sus autores y en qué revista se publican. Las diferencias de estas últimas las establece el prestigio de los comités de la revista, como además poseer referato, estar indexada, su inclusión en SCI (?Science Citation Index? o Índice de Citación en Ciencias). El factor de Impacto es un indicador que categoriza a las revistas a través de contabilizar el número de veces que es citado cada uno de sus artículos, lo cual indicaría el impacto del trabajo en el área.El SCI existe para Ciencias Sociales y para Ciencia y Tecnología, pero a veces consultar este índice tiene un costo asociado, además de que allí se indexan principalmente las revistas en idioma inglés. La falta de acceso a la información a través de Internet y a la utilización del software debido a las barreras económicas, ha generado el movimiento de acceso libre (denominado en inglés como ?open access?) para las publicaciones electrónicas y otras aplicaciones computacionales. La base Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), es un proyecto internacional liderado por la Universidad de Lund en Suecia que se muestra como un ejemplo, al igual que Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) de la Fundación Soros. The Public Library of Science (PLOS) es una organización para el apoyo y la creación de revistas de libre acceso. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), es una coalición de universidades y bibliotecas para difundir y contribuir a la iniciativa de libre acceso a las revistas académicas a través de Internet (Melero y Pérez-Agüera, 2009).Para las publicaciones en español, se han creado entidades de indexación, como Latindex, Dialnet y Scientifi c Electronic Library Online, conocida como base ?SCiELO? que es un proyecto latinoamericano en el cual participa Argentina. La indexación es un proceso que certifi ca internacionalmente la calidad científi ca de la publicación y se lleva a cabo por medio de un sistema de evaluación que analiza las publicaciones a través de distintos indicadores.Todas las bases de datos han desarrollado protocolos y software propios para la evaluación y difusión de sus publicaciones en el marco de los recursos abiertos. Estas bases de datos son las que se pueden consultar para comenzar una búsqueda de antecedentes. Esto puede complementarse con búsquedas en los sitios que poseen las diversas revistas, entre las que destacamos: Ciência &amp; Educação, Enseñanza de las Ciencias, Revista Electrónica de Enseñanza de las Ciencias, Investigaçoes em Ensino de Cièncias, Revista de Educación en Química, Revista de Educación en Biología, Revista Mexicana de Física.Para lograr una buena exploración a través de Internet se necesita usar términos adecuados acorde al objeto de estudio, ya que la búsqueda se realiza por palabras claves o algún sinónimo. Es importante preguntarse por la palabra clave de una línea de trabajo, del objeto de mi investigación. También es necesario conocer la palabra equivalente en inglés, ya que la traducción literal del término muchas veces no es la que usan los buscadores. Por ejemplo TIC en inglés: communications and information technology (C&amp;IT), virtual learning environments (vles), computer education.Como ya hemos señalado los procesos de revisión de los artículos son los que establecen el control de calidad y el valor de los mismos. Hay varios sistemas para realizar este proceso entre el que se encuentra la ?revisión de pares? como el más reconocido y consiste en la revisión de cada artículo por un número reducido de revisores (en general, dos o tres) que son especialistas en el tema del artículo. El autor desconoce quienes son los revisores, pero los revisores pueden conocer (o no) quienes son los autores, de acuerdo a la modalidad de revisión que haya implementado la revista (Godoy y Valeiras 2004). Conocer este sistema es importante cuando se desean publicar los resultados de alguna investigación para que ésta no fracase en el momento de su evaluación y de esta manera se incremente el número de trabajos que dan a conocer las experiencias que realizan los docentes.Los artículos científicosLa investigación científi ca, principalmente fi nanciada por entidades públicas, tiene como primordial vía de difusión la publicación de artículos en revistas especializadas con requerimientos y reglas para su publicación, con diferentes tipos de evaluaciones e índices de impacto. Hay otras producciones escritas provenientes de reuniones, congresos, simposio, etc., que Asúa et al. (2006) no las considera como trabajo científi co, ya que en general son cortos no accediendo a mostrar los detalles de la investigación y al carecer de esta información dificulta la labor de evaluación. Sin embargo, cada vez son más los eventos que publican resúmenes extendidos que permiten evitar estas falencias. La consideración del valor de un escrito allí presentado depende por una parte del área de trabajo y por otra, del reconocimiento y seriedad que le adjudica la comunidad investigadora a sus entidades organizadoras y sus comités de evaluación. Dejando de lado esta polémica, consideramos importante estas publicaciones, ya que se exponen los trabajos para su discusión en foros públicos y específi cos que de otra manera podrían pasar desapercibidos, sobretodo en áreas vinculadas a la formación docente.Los escritos científi cos presentan características especiales en cuanto a su redacción, entre las que se destacan su claridad y sencillez del lenguaje, su buena organización y la coherencia interna. Un aspecto a tener en cuenta a la hora de publicar es la estructura que tiene y las condiciones que se exponen en las revistas a las que se desean enviar un manuscrito. No hay una regla única al respecto, pero se pueden hacer algunas recomendaciones que ayudan a lo que la comunidad científi ca considera aceptable (Arribalzaga et al. 2005). El título de un trabajo es la carta de presentación del mismo y tiene que representar lo que éste contiene en breves palabras, que se recomienda, sean entre 40 y 90 caracteres. En cuanto al orden de los autores se supone que el primero es el que ha llevado adelante el trabajo pero muchas veces se determina este orden por consenso en el grupo de investigación. Hay estilos defi nidos por distintas normas; actualmente se ha generalizado las normas que ha establecido la American Psychological Association (Asociación Norteamericana de Psicología, APA, 2009).El cuerpo del trabajo se integra por una introducción en la que se sitúa al lector en el tema, se plantea el problema y los objetivos del mismo. A continuación se describen los antecedentes y el marco teórico, luego el material y método, los resultados y su discusión para fi nalizar con las conclusiones y la bibliografía. Conseguir publicar un artículo en una revista con referato significa haber logrado parámetros de calidad en el trabajo y el reconocimiento de los pares.Reflexiones finalesLos problemas que aparecen en las aulas de ciencias pueden encontrar soluciones a través de su investigación, por lo que es importante iniciar a los docentes y futuros docentes en este proceso. En relación a esto compartimos las dudas expuestas por Menin (2005), cuando se pregunta ?cómo iniciar a los futuros maestros en la investigación, desde la escuela, las más de las veces en situaciones adversas, cuando no hay tiempo disponible ni recurso material adecuado?. Pero hacer el esfuerzo de lograr esta meta, significaría poder articular las teorías aprendidas con las realidades de las aulas. La escritura de estas investigaciones y experiencias pueden o no, generar un artículo científi co, el cual según Kreimer (2005) es cuestionado desde diferentes ópticas que tiene que ver con los ?mitos? de este tipo de escritura tales como: los logros y legitimaciones alcanzados a través de estas publicaciones, la necesidad de publicar para permanecer con un cierto estatus en el sistema, o considerar a los artículos científi cos la ciencia ?per se?. A pesar de estos cuestionamientos, escribir las investigaciones llevadas a cabo por los docentes es una forma importante de socializar su trabajo. Aprovechar los recursos de Internet y desarrollar experiencia y habilidades para encontrar información fi able y útil en la que se apoye la investigación, al igual que refl exionar sobre distintas cuestiones inherentes a esto, aportan un conocimiento más profundo del tema, lo que redunda en benefi cios no sólo para la investigación, sino también para el trabajo en el aula. Todo ello es un desafío que la formación docente tiene que asumir.

AB  - Academic publishing is a critical aspect of research, contributing to knowledge dissemination and career advancement. However, there is a paucity of standardised instruments for assessing academics’ persistence in publishing. This study developed and validated the Persistence to Publish Questionnaire (PPQ) as a valid and reliable tool for evaluating academics’ persistence to publishing in Scopus-indexed journals. The PPQ was developed through a rigorous process, including item generation, content validity assessment, pretesting, and pilot testing of items. A sample of academics (n = 262) from various disciplines across two public universities in Cross River State participated in the validation process. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were conducted to determine the instrument’s factor structure and evaluate its fit. The results from the analysis revealed that the PPQ is a multidimensional instrument with five underlying factors – persistence in manuscript preparation, manuscript submission, handling revisions, dealing with rejections, and publication delays. The PPQ exhibited strong reliability in terms of internal consistency, with Cronbach’s α values ranging from .89 to .99. McDonald’s ω and split-half reliability corrected with the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula (rtt) results further supported its reliability. Construct validity evidence showed both convergent and discriminant validity, confirming that the PPQ effectively measures persistence to publish. The PPQ represents a valuable contribution to the field of academic publishing. It offers an opportunity for researchers and institutions to assess the degree to which academics are willing to publish, empowering researchers and institutions to identify areas of improvement and provide targeted support. This tool holds promise for enhancing research productivity and quality within the global academic community.

AB  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) models play a crucial role in various NLP tasks, including information extraction (IE) and text understanding. In academic writing, references to machine learning models and datasets are fundamental components of various computer science publications and necessitate accurate models for identification. Despite the advancements in NER, existing ground truth datasets do not treat fine-grained types like ML model and model architecture as separate entity types, and consequently, baseline models cannot recognize them as such. In this paper, we release a corpus of 100 manually annotated full-text scientific publications and a first baseline model for 10 entity types centered around ML models and datasets. In order to provide a nuanced understanding of how ML models and datasets are mentioned and utilized, our dataset also contains annotations for informal mentions like “our BERT-based model” or “an image CNN”.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to implement information security risk management (ISRM) in research information systems (RIS).Appropriate identification and assessment of risks in different aspects such as software, communications, and human resources for RIS's besides providing efficient and effective preventive and corrective actions are other aims of this study.Furthermore, continual improvement of risk response processes in information technology environment is another aim of this study.In this study, potential risks of information security are identified using failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).Also, detected failure modes are evaluated by multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) using a hybrid method of fuzzy logic, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Shannon entropy scoring method, and technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS).The result of this paper shows that information security software potential risks assessment by the proposed model is more accurate and reliable than non-fuzzy models.Unauthorized access to view or change the stored information of the server is the risk with the most important priority identified by MCDM approach.Confidentiality of information is more important than other information security criteria.Furthermore, failure modes in the category of the main server and internet have more priority in comparison to others.

AB  - Résumé Pour faire l’état des lieux du libre accès (LA) en France en 2012, dix ans après la Budapest Open Access Initiative, nous avons examiné les deux voies : la voie verte (l’auto-archivage) et la voie dorée (publications dans les revues en LA). L’archive centrale multidisciplinaire HAL, créée en 2002 pour recevoir les publications scientifiques au niveau national, est reconnue pour sa qualité technique, mais elle ne propose que 10% à 15 % de la production scientifique annuelle française. Ce chiffre est à l’image de ce qu’offrent toutes les autres archives dans le monde où il n’y a pas d’obligation de déposer (pas de mandat). Les archives qui ont un mandat comme celle de l’université de Liège, ont atteint un taux de 80% en deux ans. Quelques archives institutionnelles se sont développées en France parallèlement à HAL, et deux d’entre elles (Archimer and OATAO) ont un bon taux de remplissage, grâce à l’implication d’un personnel dédié. Pour soutenir les offres éditoriales en libre accès le Centre pour l'Édition électronique Ouverte (CLEO) a récemment mis en place OpenEdition Freemium. Cette initiative pourrait favoriser le développement des revues en LA. Cependant, l’étude faite à partir des revues qualifiantes en Sciences Humaines et Sociales montre que les chercheurs sont peu encouragés à publier dans ces revues par les instances d’évaluation : peu de revues en libre accès françaises sont présentes dans les listes des revues qualifiantes de l’agence d'évaluation de la recherche et de l'enseignement supérieur (AERES). On note aussi une forte disparité entre les disciplines. Différents exemples de politique en faveur du libre accès sont donnés : un politique forte peut être menée par des universités, comme à l’université de Liège, ou par des bailleurs de fonds, comme le FRS-FNRS en Belgique ou par l’Europe. Elle peut être entreprise au niveau législatif comme aux USA, au Brésil ou en Argentine. En France les deux voies du libre accès sont tracées par des initiatives intéressantes. Le gouvernement français devrait accompagner ces initiatives et devrait s’investir dans une politique forte pour recevoir rapidement les bénéfices du libre accès.Mots clés Libre accès, archives ouvertes, auto-archivage, publications en libre accès, voie verte, voie dorée, politique de la recherche, évaluation de la recherche, mandatResumo Para verificar como está o Acesso Livre (AL) na França em 2012, dez anos após a Budapest Open Access Initiative, foram examinadas as duas vias: a via verde (auto-arquivamento) e a dourada (publicação em periódicos em AL). O arquivo central multidisciplinar HAL, criado em 2002 para receber publicações científicas em nível nacional, é reconhecido por sua qualidade técnica, mas ele apresenta apenas 10% a 15% da produção científica francesa anual. Este número espelha o que oferecem todos os outros arquivos no mundo em que não há obrigação de depósito (ou seja, não há mandato). Os arquivos com mandato, como o da Universidade de Liège, chegaram a uma taxa de 80% em dois anos. Alguns arquivos institucionais desenvolveram-se paralelamente ao HAL, e dois deles (Archimer et OATAO) mostram um bom índice de preenchimento, graças à dedicação das pessoas envolvidas. Para sustentar a oferta editorial em acesso livre, o Centre pour l'Édition électronique Ouverte (CLEO) implementou recentemente o OpenEdition Freemium. Essa iniciativa poderia favorecer o desenvolvimento dos periódicos em AL. No entanto, o estudo feito com os periódicos qualificados em Ciências Humanas e Sociais mostra que os pesquisadores são pouco estimulados a publicar nauqueles periódicos pelas instâncias avaliadoras: poucos periódicos franceses em acesso livre estão presentes nas listas de periódicos qualificados da agence d'évaluation de la recherche et de l'enseignement supérieur (AERES)[1]. Nota-se também uma grande disparidade entre as disciplinas. São fornecidos diversos exemplos de políticas de certos países em prol do acesso livre: uma política robusta pode ser impolementada pelas universidades, como na Universidade de Liège, pelas agências de fomento, como o FRS-FNRS na Bélgica e os Research Councils na Grã Bretanha, e também pode ser empreendida no nível legislativo, como nos Estados Unidos, no Brasil ou na Argentina. Na França, as duas vias do acesso livre são traçadas por iniciativas interessantes. O governo francês deveria acompanhar essas iniciativas e desenvolver uma política forte para obter rapidamente os benefícios do acesso livre. Palavras-chave Acesso livre, repositórios abertos, auto-arquivamento, publicações em acesso livre, via verde, via dourada, política cientifica, avaliação de pesquisa, mandato [1] Com funções semelhantes às da Capes. N.do T.Abstract Ten years after the Budapest Open Access Initiative, we have examined the current situation of Open Access in France via the two open access (OA) roads: the Green (self-archiving) and the Gold (OA publishing). HAL, a central multidisciplinary French archive launched in 2002, is recognized for its technical quality, but 10 years after its creation it only includes 10 to 15% of the annual French scientific output. This figure is similar to other repositories worldwide for which there is no mandatory policy (no mandate). On the other hand, archives such as that of Liège University which has a mandate, achieved an 80% deposit rate within two years. Other than HAL, a number of institutional archives are being developed in France, with Archimer and OATAO being two successful examples, thanks to dedicated library staff. In order to support the editorial offer in open access the Centre pour l'Édition électronique Ouverte (CLEO) recently launched the Open Edition Freemium. This initiative should favor the development of OA periodicals. However, the study based on the list of qualifying periodicals in Human and Social Sciences, shows that researchers are not encouraged to publish in these periodicals by national assessment bodies; very few French open access periodicals are on the different qualifying lists of the agence d’évaluation de la recherche et de l’enseignement supérieur (AERES - French research and higher education assessment agency). In addition, a wide disparity can be observed between disciplines. Different examples of strong policies in favor of OA are given: at the university level, as at Liège university, at the level of foundations, as at FRS-FNRS in Belgium, at the level of the Europe or at the legislative level, as attempted in the USA or Brazil or Argentina. In France the two roads are supported by interesting initiatives and these should be accompanied by strong French government policy to enable the benefits of open access to be rapidly reaped.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has illustrated the lack of a holistic approach in implementing Open Science (OS), leading to an inability to fully utilise its potential to inform prompt, evidence-based policy responses. In this view, this study aims to identify and categorise the factors influencing the adoption of OS and proposes possible actions for decision-makers to develop relevant policies. To achieve this, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 experts from Australia, France, the Netherlands, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States as well as eminent international entities. During the interviews, they were asked to answer a range of questions that emerged from a systematic literature review. The responses were coded and analysed using a grounded theory approach. This led to the identification of four thematic clusters, containing a total of 24 factors that can either enable or inhibit OS practices, namely, (a) external; (b) institutional and regulatory; (c) resource-related; and (d) individual and motivational. Drawing upon Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development framework, we also propose a conceptual model that integrates these factors, accompanied with corresponding actions, into a tangible process of OS policy design and implementation.

AB  - This paper offers an overview of the highlights of the 2020 NISO Plus inaugural conference that was held in Baltimore, MD from February 23–February 25, 2020. This conference replaced what would have been the 62nd Annual NFAIS conference. However, NISO and NFAIS merged in June 2019, resulting in the conference being renamed NISO Plus and taking on a new format. The goal was to continue some of the best traditions of past NFAIS conferences while building in time for discussions. With two and a half days of networking and education on tap, attendees had the opportunity to learn about emerging and exciting areas of change and development such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and new content types such as Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality. There were very practical sessions that focused on the status of standards, current issues and problems, with the goal of working towards innovative solutions and developing plans for moving forward.

AB  - First posted April 15, 2013 For additional information, contact: Core Science SystemsU.S. Geological Survey12201 Sunrise Valley DriveReston, VA 20192 Core Science Systems is a new mission of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that resulted from the 2007 Science Strategy, “Facing Tomorrow’s Challenges: U.S. Geological Survey Science in the Decade 2007–2017.” This report describes the Core Science Systems vision and outlines a strategy to facilitate integrated characterization and understanding of the complex Earth system. The vision and suggested actions are bold and far-reaching, describing a conceptual model and framework to enhance the ability of the USGS to bring its core strengths to bear on pressing societal problems through data integration and scientific synthesis across the breadth of science.The context of this report is inspired by a direction set forth in the 2007 Science Strategy. Specifically, ecosystem-based approaches provide the underpinnings for essentially all science themes that define the USGS. Every point on Earth falls within a specific ecosystem where data, other information assets, and the expertise of USGS and its many partners can be employed to quantitatively understand how that ecosystem functions and how it responds to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Every benefit society obtains from the planet— food, water, raw materials to build infrastructure, homes and automobiles, fuel to heat homes and cities, and many others— are derived from or affect ecosystems.The vision for Core Science Systems builds on core strengths of the USGS in characterizing and understanding complex Earth and biological systems through research, modeling, mapping, and the production of high quality data on the Nation’s natural resource infrastructure. Together, these research activities provide a foundation for ecosystem-based approaches through geologic mapping, topographic mapping, and biodiversity mapping. The vision describes a framework founded on these core mapping strengths that makes it easier for USGS scientists to discover critical information, share and publish results, and identify potential collaborations that transcend all USGS missions. The framework is designed to improve the efficiency of scientific work within USGS by establishing a means to preserve and recall data for future applications, organizing existing scientific knowledge and data to facilitate new use of older information, and establishing a future workflow that naturally integrates new data, applications, and other science products to make interdisciplinary research easier and more efficient. Given the increasing need for integrated data and interdisciplinary approaches to solve modern problems, leadership by the Core Science Systems mission will facilitate problem solving by all USGS missions in ways not formerly possible.The report lays out a strategy to achieve this vision through three goals with accompanying objectives and actions. The first goal builds on and enhances the strengths of the Core Science Systems mission in characterizing and understanding the Earth system from the geologic framework to the topographic characteristics of the land surface and biodiversity across the Nation. The second goal enhances and develops new strengths in computer and information science to make it easier for USGS scientists to discover data and models, share and publish results, and discover connections between scientific information and knowledge. The third goal brings additional focus to research and development methods to address complex issues affecting society that require integration of knowledge and new methods for synthesizing scientific information. Collectively, the report lays out a strategy to create a seamless connection between all USGS activities to accelerate and make USGS science more efficient by fully integrating disciplinary expertise within a new and evolving science paradigm for a changing world in the 21st century.

AB  - Science progresses by building upon the prior body of knowledge documented in scientific publications. The acceleration of research makes it hard to stay up-to-date with the recent developments and to summarize the ever-growing body of prior work. To address this, the task of citation text generation aims to produce accurate textual summaries given a set of papers-to-cite and the citing paper context. Due to otherwise rare explicit anchoring of cited documents in the citing paper, citation text generation provides an excellent opportunity to study how humans aggregate and synthesize textual knowledge from sources. Yet, existing studies are based upon widely diverging task definitions, which makes it hard to study this task systematically. To address this challenge, we propose CiteBench: a benchmark for citation text generation that unifies multiple diverse datasets and enables standardized evaluation of citation text generation models across task designs and domains. Using the new benchmark, we investigate the performance of multiple strong baselines, test their transferability between the datasets, and deliver new insights into the task definition and evaluation to guide future research in citation text generation. We make the code for CiteBench publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/citebench.

AB  - À la fin des années 1990, Criminologie est l’une des premières revues savantes québécoises à passer au format numérique. Cet article dresse un portrait de l’usage numérique de la revue, basé sur l’analyse de 858 894 téléchargements extraits des logs du serveur de la plateforme Érudit, de 2010 à 2015. Dans l’ensemble, le lectorat de la revue semble bien établi, l’essentiel des usagers provenant d’Amérique du Nord et d’Europe. L’importance croissante de l’utilisation de la plateforme Érudit dans les pratiques de recherche des usagers, de pair avec l’effet positif de la suppression de la barrière mobile sur la diffusion de la recherche, sont également dignes de mention. Une asymétrie importante dans la distribution des consultations d’articles et de numéros thématiques a également pu être observée, une proportion importante de téléchargements étant l’affaire de quelques articles et numéros thématiques. Enfin, l’analyse des mots clés des articles téléchargés permet de souligner l’importance des problématiques locales ainsi que de la thématique autochtone en général.

AB  - El conocimiento abierto (CA) es un movimiento que busca propiciar las denominadas sociedades del conocimiento; este se puede entender como "toda forma de conocimiento creada por personas e instituciones diseminada de una forma proactiva en un formato accesible, interoperable y reutilizable. Se trata de conocimiento que se convierte en un bien público" (Moneo, 2015) . El conocimiento abierto presenta distintas manifestaciones, como pueden ser la ciencia abierta, los recursos educativos abiertos, el software de código abierto, los datos abiertos, los negocios y la innovación abierta y el acceso abierto (Lara y Rossini, 2014, pp. 22-44) . En particular, el acceso abierto (AA u Open Access) se puede considerar como una construcción colectiva que "genera beneficios directos sobre la sociedad ya que facilita una transferencia directa de conocimiento al entorno económico y social y también se disuelven las barreras entre países ricos y pobres" (Abadal, 2012) ; también va más allá de la consulta gratuita de contenidos inéditos o publicados. Para lograr esto es necesario realizar acciones en diversos sentidos, en las cuales deben participar de manera activa todos los involucrados en el apoyo, la producción y la distribución de las obras.

AB  - Objetivo: Apresentar os estudos que revisam o tema e os que não revisam concretamente a questão do gênero e da mulher na ciência da informação, porém sustentando que apenas os estudos crítico-revisionistas-críticos teriam o compromisso de fazer avançar o debate no sentido de lançar questões epistemológico-feministas à área. Metodologia: Segue um procedimento bibliográfico seletivo, elencando trabalhos que ilustram vários temas relativos à mulher inseridos na ciência da informação. Resultados: Para incorporar elementos das epistemologias feministas à ciência da informação devem ser revistas a concepção de ciência da informação, a discussão de sua identidade, a incorporação da teoria de gênero, a integração dos esforços de renovação da linguagem, o questionamento do gênero nos métodos de pesquisa e a neutralidade das tecnologias da informação. Entre empirismo, ponto de vista feminista e feminismo pós-moderno na ciência, pode-se elencar pontos que implicam mudanças na ciência da informação. Conclusões: Os trabalhos crítico-revisionistas têm manifestado diversos problemas do uso da linguagem na reprodução dos preconceitos, mas sugere-se olhar para outras frentes de atuação da área em que se fazem necessária a incorporação mais aprofundada de uma abordagem feminista. O pensamento patriarcal se esconde sob um verniz pluralista, mas segue as mesmas diretrizes de ciência-padrão e elege quem está autorizado a defini-la.

Mowa jest o gatunkach tekstów użytkowych (nieliterackich). Metody badań – Wykorzystano metodę analizy piśmiennictwa z obszaru genologii lingwistycznej oraz dyfuzji innowacji. Zmiany w strukturach mentalnych przedstawione zostały z użyciem techniki ram dynamicznych. Wyniki – Problem został przedstawiony z dwóch, kompatybilnych punktów widzenia. Po pierwsze, omówione zostały dostępne w literaturze modele ewolucji gatunków, wynikającej ze zmian technologicznych, prowadzących do upowszechnienia gatunków tekstu w formie elektronicznej (cybergatunków). Zmiany te uznane zostały za procesy innowacyjne w rozumieniu ekonomicznych teorii dyfuzji innowacji. Po drugie, ewolucja gatunków przedstawiona została od strony zmian w modelach mentalnych, tworzonych w umysłach ich użytkowników. Wnioski – We wszystkich teoriach wyróżnia się dwojakiego rodzaju zmiany gatunków tekstów: ewolucyjne i rewolucyjne, przy czym te ostatnie zwykle dotyczą zmian spowodowanych wprowadzaniem nowych technologii. Zmiany te mogą być rozpatrywane z punktu widzenia procesów tekstu, tekstu jako wyniku realizacji tych procesów lub reprezentacji mentalnych pojęć dotyczących tych procesów i gatunków tekstu.

AB  - Introdução: A emergência da Web Semântica vem impactando o ambiente de publicações digitais científicas. O crescimento da literatura biomédica em formato digital suscita a questão de que novas descobertas podem ter origem não só nos laboratórios, mas também nas bases de dados bibliográficas e factuais. O formato textual linear dos artigos científicos, voltado para leitura humana, é inadequado ao tratamento por computadores. Objetivos: Contextualizar o problema de pesquisa de modelos semântico para artigos digitais em ciências biomédicas, identificando áreas correlatas e produzindo uma revisão da literatura.Metodologia: A pesquisa é descritiva e exploratória, centrada no problema da de pesquisa, procurando identificar interfaces entre as áreas revistas; a abordagem é qualitativa, os métodos foram pesquisa bibliográfica e documentaria. Resultados: apresentação do estado da arte e principais questões em cada subárea, mineração de textos biomédicos e publicações estendidas/modelos semânticos de publicações; são áreas complementares mas não integradas.Conclusões: Estamos em transição de um modelo de publicação centrado no artigo textual linear para um modelo em que o artigo digital, em um novo formato, é um dos elos de uma rede de recursos interligados e acessíveis simultaneamente, processáveis por programas, tirando partido das tecnologias da Web Semântica.

AB  - On September 25, 1999, 80 academic library leaders got together at the American Research Libraries/Online Computer Library Center (ARL/OCLC) Director's Summit in Keystone, Colorado, USA. They challenged themselves to plan for the future of libraries in the digital environment. They all believed that to remain viable in the global economy, libraries and librarians need to assert the underlying values of librarianship as a way to redefine the rules of the playing field in this new environment. An informal working group agreed to write a statement articulating the values of academic libraries and how those values could be reflected in the digital arena. As Carla Stoffle, Dean of University Libraries and the Center of Creative Photography at the University of Arizona states, "We must all become activists, seize the initiative, and gain control of the 'rules' which are now in the hands of others" (Stoffle, 2003). The 'others' are publishers, software producers, information technology professionals, etc. At Keystone participants tackled the following topics: · How to create and support new learning and research environments · How to work creatively with information providers to develop strong responses to needs · How to engage in the changing aspects of teaching and learning in higher education · How to expand their library's knowledge management role within the university · How to connect the values of libraries with the technological environment (Stoffle, 2000). So the Keystone Principles require explicit action based on three specified user-centered principles and twenty-two action items rooted in our values.

AB  - The EU’s scientific potential is increasingly flowing into the world of new scientific knowledge. The object of this paper is the communication interpretation of the Open Science policy, covering not only access and storage of scientific information and preservation of scientific information, but communication aspects also. Purpose of the study: Establish modern trends in the scientific ecosystem oriented towards facilitating the publication and communication of scientific results. Tasks of the study: Compare new solutions in science communication models in the most popular platforms, and explore what is the alternative to traditional scientific journals. Methodology/approach: The qualitative systematic review (qualitative evidence synthesis),scientific criticism of sociological surveys, methods of analytic and synthetic processing of primary and secondary resources, secondary data analysis and overview of scientific publications available in the libraries worldwide, have been used to obtain data about the impact of new EU solutions: the European Road Map for development of the European Research Area (ERA),the European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, etc. A comparative analysis of innovation in publishing platforms was conducted with special attention to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s Gates Open Research platform. Results: The creators of the Gates Open Research platform defend the view of the rapid and socially beneficial effect of new and publicly-accepted scientific knowledge.The cutting-edge solutions are: transfer power from the hands of editors to the hands of the authors; minimize barriers or gatekeepers on the path of the new scientific outcome for society; assessment of the research not in view of the venue of publication but on the basis of the intrinsic value of the completed study; minimize the funds invested in publishing and dissemination. Implications: The conclusions can be important in identifying technological and ideological regularities for optimizing the model of scientific publications and increasing the speed and visibility of any scientific news.

AB  - Les acteurs intermédiaires de la chaîne documentaire, soit les éditeurs et bibliothécaires, sont de plus en plus impliqués dans des projets de diffusion électronique d’information. En même temps, ils doivent continuer à répondre à la demande de supports imprimés. Les différentes approches pour assurer cette coexistence se résument aux trois scénarios suivants : produire la forme imprimée pour en dériver par la suite des versions électroniques; produire parallèlement les deux formes; ou enfin, produire les deux formes à partir d’un document source unique contenant toute information sémantique requise pour ces deux opérations. Cet article étudie les principaux avantages de cette troisième approche et en présente une application dans le cadre d’un projet pilote de revues savantes aux Presses de l’Université de Montréal. Les auteurs abordent les questions entourant le choix des formats de diffusion et d’archivage. Le format SGML a été retenu pour ses qualités d’intégration, sa pérennité et la richesse sémantique qu’il peut exprimer. Érudit, le projet pilote présenté en détail ici, a consisté à développer une chaîne de traitement fortement automatisée basée sur le SGML, lequel format sera bientôt remplacé par le format XML. Du format SGML sont produits automatiquement des versions HTML, format standard de diffusion sur le Web, ainsi que des formats d’impression, soit PostScript et PDF, respectivement destinés à l’impression de la publication papier et l’impression à distance.

AB  - of the Annual Business MeetingThe first ASLO annual meeting outside of North America was a great success largely in part due to the capable hands of the organizing committee, the event planner (DIS) and especially the overall leadership of Morton Sondergaard and Bo Riemann.Nearly 1500 participants from 49 countries attended, making the conference one of the largest for ASLO and demonstrating the interest level in having ASLO meetings in Europe.(See table .)The ASLO business meeting was called to order at 1700 on Tuesday, June 6, 2000, at the Belle Center in Copenhagen.Approximately 60 people attended the public meeting to review the business of the society as required in the by-laws.President Tom Malone welcomed everyone to a very lively meeting and thanked the membership for a stimulating and rewarding two years as president.(See President's Message in the Spring 2000 ASLO Bulletin.Treasurer Russ Moll cautiously reported that the financial difficulties of the society are a past issue due to the increase subscription rates.Everett Fee, Editor-in-Chief of Limnology and Oceanography, provided an overview of the journal, highlighting that the time between manuscript submission and final publication is approximately four months.Secretary Asit Mazumder gave an overview of the society membership including institutional subscriptions.

AB  - What should the relationship be between the purely Open Access publishers and librarians? Yes, in theory, among publishers these are publishers who are fully aligned with libraries to end the stranglehold which the traditional subscription publishers have on libraries. Yes, they are 100% attribution-only (CC-BY) publishers living up to the goals of Open Access (as described in the Budapest Open Access Initiative [BOAI]). But, are they just replacing over-priced subscriptions with over-priced APCs (Article Processing Charges)?

AB  - No research article exists in a vacuum. There are no scientific texts in modern science that do not reference other works, and generally those references are meant to support the authors’ assertions. References are a well-understood way to evaluate a piece of research, and those references help tell a story about how the authors reached their conclusions. References tell the story of the research itself; they show the history, they reveal facts that support the assertions, and they lead the reader to the underlying data. But what about the story behind the evaluation process that brings that research to the public? There is an important story that needs to be told about this part of the life of the research article. The story behind the editorial process—the subplot, so to speak—can help readers and other researchers understand and evaluate the rigor of the peer review and the quality of the publishing process. It would be really useful for readers, funders, and institutions to know what kind of quality checks were made on the manuscript, how many reviewers assessed which versions, and what changes the editor asked the author to make. All of these rich details that are hidden within the editorial workflow should be part of the story. There is an interesting initiative underway to help tell the story behind the editorial process for any document that claims to be a scholarly work. The initiative, called the DocMap Framework, seeks to define a machine-readable protocol that anyone can use to […]

AB  - This article describes the concept of the Publishing Makerspace, which is a publishing environment that is reconfigured as a place where all the components of a scholarly project—books and e‐books, virtual and physical exhibits, visualizations, live performance and film—can be integrated using a collaborative process. This place enables the creation of a multimodal publishing environment that fully integrates digital content with manuscripts and “traditional” scholarly content. Starting with an overview of the history of the team that devised this approach and its membership, the article describes the problem that the authors have identified with current approaches to multimodal publishing and outlines a workshop model for engaging in a reconfiguration of the publishing process, including a description of a new publishing and knowledge making ecosystem that includes librarians, publishers, and other collaborators.

AB  - The world is rapidly changing driven by the rise of data and Artificial Intelligence (AI).Many industries are facing wholesale change.Customers now expect tailored, digital solutions and personalized insights delivered at the point of need -and structural transformation is simmering as a result.This paper looks at the sea change and opportunities in the academic publishing sector.Driven by technology and changes in user experience, publishers need to harness technologies such as AI to help them evolve from being traditional content providers to data-driven product companies.Data is at the heart of everything.Increasing their data maturity will fuel innovation and power the transformed products and services that customers demand going forward.As part of this feature 67 Bricks will also introduce the Product Development Data Maturity model for scholarly publishers to help plot a course from where they are now to where they need to be to survive.

AB  - In these uncertain economic times, library administrators are often faced with tough budget decisions. They are encouraged to “think outside the box” for creative strategies to help cut costs while not diminishing services to library patrons. Wendy Bartlett’s Floating Collections: A Collection Development Model for Long-Term Success offers one such creative and thought-provoking strategy, particularly for public library systems.

AB  - Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Session 1358 Experiences with Academic Publishing on the Internet: A Look at the Technology Interface Jeffrey S. Beasley, Charles T. Townley New Mexico State University Abstract This paper discusses the experiences of publishing academic papers through Internet journals such as the Technology Interface. While Internet publishing creates many opportunities for exchanging information, this can also cause concern for ownership, proper cataloging, citing, and archiving. Also, the Internet is a dynamic environment. Many questions arise due to the use of Internet publications. For example, should journal documents be allowed to change once placed on-line? Can a previously published paper be updated? Should guidelines for publishing on the Internet be different than the printed press? Should articles be published in HTML format or another such as Adobe Acrobat? Who should pay for the opportunity to publish on the Internet? This paper will address these issues and includes a discussion of the experiences with the Technology Interface. Introduction Before 1996, only 100 on-line titles of science, technology and medicine (STM) peer-reviewed journals appeared on-line.1 A search on the Internet search engine Yahoo! 2 was conducted January, 1998 using the underlined keywords. The search produced the following results: • Found 266 Category and 4495 Site Matches for journal. • Found 14 Category and 51 Site Matches for journals in engineering, • Found 4 Category and 130 Site Matches for Technology Journals. • Found 3 Category and 418 Site Matches for magazine technology. • Found 0 categories and 2 sites for engineering technology journal Not all of the listings are classified as peer-reviewed journals but the impact the Internet is making on electronic publishing is evident by the number of site matches to the keyword search. The Technology Interface is a recent addition to the long list of providers of electronic information on the Internet. The first issue of the Technology Interface - the Electronic Journal for Engineering Technology appeared on the Internet in November of 1996. The Technology Interface is a paperless on-line publication accessed via the World-Wide Web (WWW). The Technology Interface was developed specifically to provide professionals in the Engineering Technology profession and related fields, the opportunity to share ideas concerning teaching, teaching improvements, projects, industrial activities, research and much more via the Internet. This paperless media provides the convenience for organizations to freely share their information. The journal is now in its second year of publication.

AB  - The world is rapidly changing driven by the rise of data and Artificial Intelligence (AI).Many industries are facing wholesale change.Customers now expect tailored, digital solutions and personalized insights delivered at the point of need -and structural transformation is simmering as a result.This paper looks at the sea change and opportunities in the academic publishing sector.Driven by technology and changes in user experience, publishers need to harness technologies such as AI to help them evolve from being traditional content providers to data-driven product companies.Data is at the heart of everything.Increasing their data maturity will fuel innovation and power the transformed products and services that customers demand going forward.As part of this feature 67 Bricks will also introduce the Product Development Data Maturity model for scholarly publishers to help plot a course from where they are now to where they need to be to survive.

AB  - What are the budget, funding, and spending patterns within libraries in the current economic environment?• How do librarians evaluate content?What data do you gather?What is the role of the teaching faculty in decision making?• What role do mobile applications play in libraries?• What are the factors in eBook purchasing decisionmaking?What role does print play, if any? • What makes a good e-journal?What enhancements would you like to see in them?• What are the functions of your institutional repository, and what role is the library playing in publishing?All of the panelists reported that the continued recession is placing pressure on their libraries and the services they are able to offer.Gammon noted that "serials ate the book budget" entirely, and at Akron the monographs are now funded solely out of student library fees.McElroy noted that while the materials budget at Oregon Health & Science University is stable, funding for operations has been cut.OHSU has been fortunate that the academic departments and clinicians have been willing to share the costs of particular resources, though McElroy noted that at any time, faced with their own budget pressures, the departments might choose to pull back.Schools with large endowments are more insulated.But at Penn, where the faculty expects a high level of service, the library must continually prove its worth.At Michigan, every significant price increase of a digital resource or journal package must be justified, and the library has cut 1,300 subscriptions.Library budgets are flat at Stanford, and positions have been frozen.Collections have been pruned, and as Josephine described, "every purchase is a decision, nothing is automatic."At Michigan, the healthy research dollars the school brings in help to supplement the library's collection, but the way in which outside grant money is allocated to libraries is not uniform.Murray-Rust noted that faculty expects the library to support the areas of research in which they have been awarded grants, and yet the library rarely receives funds for that purpose.State-wide consortia have played an important part in managing collections through state funding.In Ohio and Oregon, the state-wide consortia are encouraging libraries to collaborate on monograph collections.Ohiolink recommends that no more than five libraries in the state hold a title and ORBIS recommends just three.While these policies do not preclude more libraries from purchasing copies, they do relieve pressure on already-strained budgets.Murray-Rust worries that as funding to Galileo is reduced, Georgia Tech will need to find room in its budget to cover key resources that were historically paid for by the state.

KW  - Metadata Quality
KW  - Visibility
AB  - Most book and monograph publications still lack visibility within an electronic environment due to missing digitalized and persistent bibliographic data and/or fragmentary portability or interoperability based on the variety of formats, resulting in a more error-prone, non-standardized communication between various indexing systems and platforms. But books that cannot be discovered will not be read. OA metadata for books is essential for the transformation of the whole scholarly landscape, and one of its greatest advantages is full, immediate accessibility. 1 The point of origin for the OA META project was the realization that available book metadata (i.e. ONIX/MARC records) was not primarily created for the usage of indexing within an electronic research environment. Consequentially, both detail and focus of elements tagged in datasets are not necessarily selected to output solidified and persistent book records. The question was how to enrich or edit available metadata so that it can unfold its greatest impact in an e-context.

AB  - ABSTRACT Access to knowledge is a critical issue when intellectual property rights are debated among governments in such fora as the World Intellectual Property Organization and the World Trade Organization. Scientific and scholarly materials became available online long before other types of copyright‐protected works, such as music and films. It is therefore particularly interesting to analyse how this specific field of publishing has adapted to the new digital landscape. Lessons can be learnt from related business sectors. Licensing is a key component in creating access, on terms and conditions that are fair and balanced for users in all parts of the world; this will encourage writing and publishing both now and in the future.

AB  - Collaboration has increased in importance in academic libraries over the past several years, both as a value and a model of work. While certainly not a new concept, cooperative work with campus partners, external partners, and within the library itself has become increasingly common. In Academic Libraries and Collaborative Research Services, editor Carrie Forbes (University of Denver) brings together a wide variety of perspectives on internal and external library collaborations. Fourteen chapters are divided into four sections, with topics including liaison work, cross-institutional and cross-continental partnerships, evidence synthesis, data literacy, and open scholarship. Academic librarians of all experience levels and in a wide variety of roles will be able to find something relevant to their work.

AB  - Rethinking Collection Development and Management is an anthology of essays authored by professionals active in the field, broadly conceived. The treatment of each topic is highly contemporary and carries with it the distinct perspective of personal experience. This pronounced subjectivity distinguishes this volume from more directly instructive texts such as Peggy Johnson’s Fundamentals of Collection Development and Management, 3rd ed. (ALA Editions, 2014). Indeed, the publisher recommends the volume as a supplement to its more traditional textbook counterparts.1 Taken as a whole the volume seeks to situate contemporary collection development and management as a field evolving in many directions at once.

AB  - Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment Inc. for PALSave, an affordable education initiative that will combat rising textbook costs and their detrimental effects on student success and retention. The average cost of textbooks annually is about $1,300. Research from The Student Public Interest Research Groups and U.S. PIRG Education Fund shows that some students have to borrow more to pay for college, are likely not to buy required materials at some point, and might even drop a class because of text prices. PALNI offers the PALSave program in response to this need and to help provide a proactive solution to textbook affordability. The grant will enable PALNI to support course transformations using course materials which are free to students, focusing on Open Educational Resources worldwide.

AB  - During the last years the call for publishing and sharing research data has become ubiquitous. Besides moral appeals towards transparency as a basic principle of science, more and more policies and regulations start to push researchers to make their research data available to the scientific community and the general public. In addition to research funding organizations, publishers are most influential in this regard as they are able to boost the practice of data sharing by incentives that are highly attractive for researchers: publications and hence reputation in academia. In consequence more and more datasets are published by researchers – in very different ways, using the quite heterogeneous tools and publishing solutions currently available.However, these data publications do not necessarily increase transparency in research. Publishing research data might even contribute to an increase in noise and opacity. Mere disclosure of date has very little value per se, as The Royal Society in its report “Science as an open enterprise” (2012) noticed. The report asks for “intelligent openness” where data are not just published but effectively communicated. To accomplish intelligent openness, data have to be accessible, intelligible, assessable and usable (p. 14).The presentation will take up this consideration and explore the challenges involved. Communicating data aims at enabling receivers (i. e. data users) to correctly interpret and appropriately use the published research data. As will be shown by examples of published datasets from the field of behavioral and social sciences, currently this aim is by no means generally achieved. In seeking to comply with data policies of funders and publishers researcher may be inclined to publish datasets that are hardly intelligible and not usable. Additionally there is a lack of data publishing infrastructures (including technical tools as well as standards and social practices) supporting researchers in communicating data in a meaningful way to their different audiences. Obviously, it is much easier to share data within the own research community than across research fields, disciplines or even cultures. In general, the less the researchers who publish data and the audience who wants to use these data share a common context (increasing “distance-from-data-origin”, Baker &amp; Yarmey 2009), the more demanding communicating research data will become.Thus, publishers face considerable challenges when trying to advance from publishing to communicating research data. Developing solutions pointing in this direction should be, nevertheless, of primary concern, as publishing without communicating might ultimately be just a waste of resources. Therefore, besides exploring the challenges, the presentation will also try to identify steps that might help to approach the ambitious goal of communicating research data.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the use of scholarly communication platforms in Zambia, exploring the perceptions, usage patterns and factors influencing the adoption and utilisation of these platforms among Zambian researchers and academics. Employing a cross-sectional survey design, the study gathered data from a sample of faculty members and researchers at selected universities in Zambia. The survey instrument consisted of three sections, collecting information on demographic background, scholarly communication practices in Zambia and the scholarly communication platforms used by the academic community. The findings reveal insights into the perceptions of scholarly communication services, the challenges faced by Zambian researchers in accessing and utilising scholarly resources and potential strategies to enhance scholarly communication in the country. Additionally, the study identifies the scholarly communication platforms most widely used by the Zambian academic community and the factors influencing their adoption and usage. This research contributes to the limited literature on scholarly communication in Zambia, providing valuable insights for stakeholders involved in promoting and enhancing scholarly communication practices within the country.

AB  - Student Journal Forum began as an in-person half-day event at the University of Toronto (U of T) in 2015. It was organized by a group of librarians with the goal to connect editors of 60+ student-led U of T journals with publishing supports, best practices, and with each other. The audience’s enthusiastic engagement and the community-building power of the event prompted the librarians to offer it again the next year, and the year after. Eight years later, this local annual event has grown into a Canada-wide virtual gathering. The shift to online during the COVID-19 pandemic was a key catalyst to open the Forum to students to connect remotely, and for the event to be jointly organized by multiple libraries across Canada. The event’s offering has evolved as well, moving from librarian-led publishing best practice sessions to student-led presentations and participatory learning sessions. The most recent 2023 Forum featured an open call for proposals that let student editors share their experiences and present on topics that mattered to them. It was complemented by a half-day of publishing skill sessions presented by Canadian librarians and two panels with scholarly editors and publishing professionals. In this paper, we reflect on the evolution of the Student Journal Forum, its successes and challenges, and its role in establishing the connection between student editors across Canada and between different Canadian libraries that offer student journal publishing support.

AB  - Scholarly communication librarianship is a messy field. Its margins are ill-defined and ever- changing. There is a lack of curricular training in library schools and a lack of opportunities for early-career candidates. As a result, preparing librarians for a scholarly communication career presents a challenge. In this piece I discuss this messiness and describe my personal experiences in a residency position, showing how these kinds of positions support the professional development of scholarly communication librarians, with specific reference to the NASIG Core Competencies for scholarly communication librarians.

AB  - This paper discusses an approach allowing researchers – users of some CRIS – to initiate and maintain scholarly pre-publication communication. The pre-publication communication takes place between authors of some research outputs and researchers who use these outputs on a stage of preparing their own research papers. Such communication is initiated when a researcher who uses CRIS tools is manipulating with a research output text and/or with the text fragments to create his/her own research outputs. In this paper a SocioRePEc CRIS is presented, which is being designed specifically to allow researchers in economics (who belong to a bigger international community of RePEc users) to make experiments with the pre-publication communication. By this, researchers get capacity to use research outputs available at RePEc (metadata and/or full texts in PDF) in so-called "interactive" mode. The discussion explains that this interactive usage mode leads to better adjustment of the researchers' supply and demand, and opens an opportunity for the further wider/deeper research cooperation.

AB  - Watch the VIDEO.The Swedish government has expressed an intention to move towards open access (OA) to publications based on publicly funded research in Sweden. As part of fulfilling this intention, the Bibsam Consortium, working on behalf of a number of Swedish universities, government agencies, and research institutes, has started to include OA in their negotiations with publishers. One consequence is that Bibsam has followed other international actors and entered into a number of offset agreements. The first of these agreements was Springer Compact, which runs from July 2016 to December 2018. The implementation and consequences of this agreement are being investigated at the request of Bibsam, and this presentation builds on findings from this investigation.Offset agreements are presented as one possible road ahead, a temporary one, in the transition towards OA to scholarly publications. A number of factors, including costs and the speed of flipping hybrid journals to full OA, will determine the success of such agreements. The attitudes of the researchers – the authors of the publications – are also key in determining the outcome. This presentation reports on findings from a questionnaire submitted by 375 first authors of articles covered by the Swedish Springer Compact agreement. It will present the authors’ attitudes to OA, to the Springer Compact agreement, and to future similar agreements.The study shows that only about one quarter of respondents knew about the agreement before submitting their work. A majority would not have paid article processing charges (APC) for their article had APCs not been covered by the agreement. Many are generally positive to OA publishing, however. When asked what they think about agreements such as Springer Compact, three quarters wrote in free-text answers that it is “good”, “very good” or “excellent”. Respondents express both appreciation of the easy process and a relief over not having to find funding for OA.Some respondents were more tentative, saying that they appreciate OA, but that their opinion about the agreement depends on the cost. Non-profit solutions to academic publishing or alternative methods to achieving OA were also mentioned as desirable. A small number of respondents would prefer the traditional subscription model. Yet, the vast majority of respondents say they would like to see similar agreements with other publishers.The answers to the questionnaire show that these researchers are very positive to having their work published OA if it is not associated with costs, limitations, or other hassles for the researcher. That is, if publishing remains no more problematic than in the subscription system, researchers see many benefits with OA. However, there is a minority which expresses ideological hesitation. From this, universities and funders can learn the value of facilitating OA publishing for the individual researcher, but also that many researchers will expect agreements to be economically feasible and that there is a potential to engaging researchers even more in the discussion of future solutions.

AB  - Research Commons is dedicated library space for researchers. Research Commons in libraries are important to develop research culture in the university environment [1]. In order to review and enhance the current status of research support activities of the Library, University of Moratuwa (UoM) a, a survey was carried out among all academic staff members and postgraduate students at the UoM. The survey aimed to investigate the usage and importance of current research support services and find out the importance of some proposed research support services. As the research instrument, a questionnaire was developed after conducting a pilot study among eminent researchers and focus group interviews with library academics. Current library services as well as new library services were ranked using average weighted scores [2]. Average weighted score was calculated to determine overall order of preference as shown below. Largest weight was given for most preferred choice.

AB  - In 2019, MIT Press and University of Michigan Press launched their own ebook collections for direct sale to libraries. Nearly a year has gone by. In that year, three basic truths have emerged and continue to guide them on this journey: 1. Establish Principles - Our principles must be our central reference point. We must innovate by taking a “values-based” approach not just a solely “value-based” selection process. 2. Embrace Exploration, Agility and Humility - We are perpetual searchers and seekers, always novices and beginners. Transformation comes from discovering the right questions more than having the right answers. 2. Take Action - We cannot think ourselves into new ways of acting, rather we act ourselves into a new way of thinking. Impactful change will only happen when we take risks, focus on people, and shift from monologue to dialogue when engaging with the communities we serve. How did they come to these truths? What are the prospects for each of their individual endeavors? Why should libraries care? In this paper, representatives of the two presses will tell their respective stories about this last year’s adventures. We they share why they chose to work directly with libraries, what they expected after launching their new collections, as well as divulge what reality actually dealt them.

AB  - Every campus appears to be “in the know” when it comes to open access, yet many of us “in the trenches” at our university libraries know that not to be the case. Often what is closer to reality is that there are many pockets of disparate knowledge on campus that need to be harnessed and reconciled in order to truly develop a program that benefits the whole. This poster will describe Rowan University’s current Open Access (OA) and Open Educational Resources (OER) initiatives that conference attendees may use as templates for programs at their institutions.

AB  - The abrupt closure of universities in 2020 because of COVID-19 forced many of them to adopt online learning through various technological platforms. Institutional repositories (IRs), digital archives of intellectual outputs of universities, could be important in online education. However, there is a dearth of empirical data on their ability to support teaching, learning and research in universities. This study aimed to investigate the role of IRs in supporting teaching, learning and research in Kenyan universities during the Covid-19 and to identify challenges faced by the universities in the usage of IRs. The study was informed by the technology acceptance model and adopted a mixed method approach and a multiple-case (embedded) research design. The study was conducted in four universities using a sample of 370 students, 322 academic staff and 12 key informants, selected by a mix of stratified, random, and purposive sampling technique respectively. The study found that IRs played crucial roles in supporting teaching, learning and research during the pandemic, with three out of every four respondents (n=424, 73%) using it for teaching, learning and research. Alarmingly, IR usage was lowest, χ2 (4) = 73.462, p&lt;0.0001, among the senior-most academic staff (professors, associate professors, and senior lecturers) relative to junior staff and students. Perceived lack of usefulness and difficulty of use of IRs constituted the major challenges. This study recommends the improvement of IRs perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to enable them better support teaching, learning and research.

AB  - According to the OA Diamond Journals Study of diamond open access journal operators, 53% of journals employ less than one full-time worker, and 60% of journals rely heavily on volunteers. Due to these resource constraints, most diamond open access journals publish less than 25 articles per year, and 75% of journals are not able to provide their content in XML and HTML but only in PDF (Bosman et al., 2021, p. 7-8).For them to keep up with larger commercial publishers and their professionalized content output, a high degree of process automation and streamlining is necessary. The Open Source Academic Publishing Suite (OS-APS, https://os-aps.de/en/) project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research aims to achieve this. Smaller and medium-sized publishers usually deliver Word manuscripts. OS-APS automatically extracts the underlying XML from these manuscripts, offers optimization, and, most importantly, export in various formats (PDF, HTML, XML, EPUB). Professional corporate design, such as that of the PDFs, is also managed automatically by reusing templates or by creating one’s own with the OS-APS Template Development Kit.In addition, OS-APS will also connect to scholarly and community-driven publishing platforms such as Open Journal Systems (OJS), Open Monograph Press (OMP), and DSpace: the software will be able to be integrated into a wide range of publication processes, whether with small, low-resource, commercial, institutional, or diamond open access publishers. To understand the requirements of these heterogeneous publishers, the OS-APS project has a practical advisory and a scientific advisory board with representatives from the different publishing sectors. In addition, it regularly holds demo days with feedback opportunities. One such demo will be given at PUBMET2022.The Open Source software could be a significant improvement for smaller, independent OA publishers to streamline their processes, create new e-book formats (such as HTML, EPUB), and secure their long-term presence and bibliodiversity. The project is in line with the recommendations of the OA Diamond Study and its call for cOAlition S funders and infrastructures to “support the development of generic tools to generate structured content in XML and HTML” (Becerril et al., 2021, p. 20).

AB  - Sometimes it’s hard to find answers for work-related questions. This difficulty is compounded when one lacks the means to engage with a community of peers who face similar situations and problems. As institutional repository (IR) managers, we found ourselves with access to resources and listservs that didn’t quite fit our needs. Available discussion spaces were either too general in scope, drowning out repository-specific concerns; or too narrowly focused on platform-specific issues and technical details.

AB  - e image of the monastic humanities scholar toiling away in a paper-laden faculty office to produce a scholarly monograph is a popular stereotype.It is popular in part because it simplifies the oen abstract, organic, and even rambling processes involved in humanities-based research.As humanists increasingly collaborate by using online and digital tools, however, the messy office metaphor requires a literal and systematic overhaul.e collaborative processes between humanities scholars and students takes this stereotype and finds new ways to create and mobilize knowledge generated in digital environments.Drawing from two gatherings of the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) project, the articles collected in these three issues (6.2, 6.3, 6.4) of Scholarly and Research Communication (SRC) work to do just that.As part of an ongoing conversation in SRC (Arbuckle, Crompton, & Mauro, 2014), these issues will continue to describe new ways humanities researchers, publishers, and policy makers can collaborate effectively to make the most of the new affordances of computational tools and methods.

AB  - Peer review is under pressure. Without fair, transparent and efficient peer review we cannot ensure the right proposals get funded and the correct manuscripts get published. In the era of Open Access, which is driving an exponential increase in the number of submitted publications, how we carry out peer review is becoming increasingly important and how we find reviewers is coming under scrutiny. The current methods are slow and produce bias pools of reviewers. As such we need an improved way. At Prophy we have developed a state-of-the-art referee finder that can find experts to review any manuscript from any scientific field in seconds. Then through post-processing filters we can find appropriate candidate referees who are most likely to review a paper, whilst highlighting important conflicts of interest through our complex citation networks. These methods can ensure fair and independent experts who can review interdisciplinary papers from any discipline. These methods are being delivered through APIs and the editorial workflow of editors ensure the right people get access to these tools. Finally, as large-language models improve, so does Prophy and as such we will be looking to drive real innovation in this area in years to come.

AB  - MENTAL DEVELOPMENT (TAMD), published four times a year, publishes original papers of archival journal quality in Autonomous Mental Development (AMD).Recent advances in computational intelligence, cognitive science, neuroscience, and robotics have stimulated the birth and rapid growth of this new research field.Mental development is a process during which a brain-like natural or artificial embodied system, under the control of its intrinsic species-specific developmental program, develops mental capabilities through its real-time interactions with its environments (including the brain's own internal environment) using its own sensors and effectors.The mental capabilities include perceptual, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and all other mental capabilities that are exhibited by humans, higher animals, and artificial systems.The scope of TAMD includes: • Computational modeling of mental development, including mental architecture, theories, algorithms, properties and experiments;• Experimental investigations relevant to the goal of achieving a computational understanding of developmental processes in humans and animals, especially those focusing on the role of experience and on the active exploration of the environment; • Engineering applications of autonomous mental development such as mechanisms enabling highly complex capabilities by robots and other artificial systems.Investigations in AMD are expected to improve our systematic understanding of the working of the wide variety of mental capabilities in humans.Authors are encouraged to submit papers that disclose significant conceptual, computational, or empirical discovery, technical and practical knowledge, exploratory developments, and applications to both artificial and biological mentally developing systems.The Transactions encourage papers submitted from all areas related to mental development, including, but not limited to, computer science, engineering, neuroscience, psychology, biology, medicine, and philosophy.Due to the existence of many empirically oriented journals in the field of human developmental psychology, the Transactions will emphasize computational approaches to mental development and experimental studies that make contact with computational approaches.

AB  - Despite its capacity to reach readers irrespective of affiliation or geographic location, conversations about Open Access (OA) frequently center academic stakeholders in high-income countries. This presentation will examine opportunities for technical services librarians to explore with students some of the inequities of the scholarly communications landscape, including various approaches to and aspects of OA, and to consider the disparate levels of access available to individuals based on institutional affiliation. Because higher education settings afford students a high degree of information privilege, academic librarians face the challenge of teaching students to appreciate the value of information, acknowledge barriers to it, and identify and evaluate the freely available resources and content to which they will have access post-graduation. Although technical services and scholarly communication librarians tend to have fewer teaching responsibilities than those working in public services, our experiences with collection development, licensing, and resource description provide insights to share with students regarding information value and privilege. A case study on student projects which included the editing of Wikipedia entries highlights tensions between institutional privilege and open resources. Teaching students about the costs, processes, and value of information production empowers them to understand their privilege and responsibilities.

AB  - My working day begins any time between 7.30am and 8.30am, depending partly on when my first meeting starts (and since we have offices in the US, Europe and Asia, early meetings are fairly common). My current position spans circulation management (including subscriptions management, membership management, and circulation analysis), journals marketing and library marketing. Depending on which of those hats I’m wearing, I might be meet- ing with the executive director of a major society to discuss ways of boosting their membership numbers, looking at circulation growth for a group of our journals over the last five years, or brain- storming how to launch a new sales initiative to libraries.

AB  - Beall’s list heavily used as a base for selection of predatory journals by large no. of research studies was ceased from internet in 2017. Thus, status of journal declared as predatory in list is debatable. To verify quality of journals in terms of accuracy and standard of peer review, a sample of Medical Science journals from Beall list and indexed in reputed indexing/abstracting databases was taken. sample of journals was put to quality and credibility check by submitting a deliberately flawed research article. deliberate errors exceed an acceptable norm in submitted research paper. It is astonishing to see that majority of journals (61.96%) accept flawed article on such a sensitive issue, i.e., COVID-19 without peer review and desired revisions. Instant mails reporting paper's acceptance, preceded by multiple emails requesting for submission for Article processing fee, were received frequently. It is found that such publishing ventures are a scare story that only wants to generate as much revenue as possible.

AB  - This paper is based on a panel session on various aspects of the Version of Record (VOR) – the permanent record, held at the APE 2022 Conference. It argues that even with the current possibility of sharing versions and elements of the VOR, such as a preprint, an Author Accepted Manuscript or protocols, the VOR still remains valuable. The scholarly community should continue to protect the VOR and recognise it as an enabler of invention. This way, research can be communicated in more rapid, more open and more diverse ways, enabling readers to access a fuller picture of research.

AB  - MENTAL DEVELOPMENT (TAMD), published four times a year, publishes original papers of archival journal quality in Autonomous Mental Development (AMD).Recent advances in computational intelligence, cognitive science, neuroscience, and robotics have stimulated the birth and rapid growth of this new research field.Mental development is a process during which a brain-like natural or artificial embodied system, under the control of its intrinsic species-specific developmental program, develops mental capabilities through its real-time interactions with its environments (including the brain's own internal environment) using its own sensors and effectors.The mental capabilities include perceptual, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and all other mental capabilities that are exhibited by humans, higher animals, and artificial systems.The scope of TAMD includes: • Computational modeling of mental development, including mental architecture, theories, algorithms, properties and experiments;• Experimental investigations relevant to the goal of achieving a computational understanding of developmental processes in humans and animals, especially those focusing on the role of experience and on the active exploration of the environment; • Engineering applications of autonomous mental development such as mechanisms enabling highly complex capabilities by robots and other artificial systems.Investigations in AMD are expected to improve our systematic understanding of the working of the wide variety of mental capabilities in humans.Authors are encouraged to submit papers that disclose significant conceptual, computational, or empirical discovery, technical and practical knowledge, exploratory developments, and applications to both artificial and biological mentally developing systems.The Transactions encourage papers submitted from all areas related to mental development, including, but not limited to, computer science, engineering, neuroscience, psychology, biology, medicine, and philosophy.Due to the existence of many empirically oriented journals in the field of human developmental psychology, the Transactions will emphasize computational approaches to mental development and experimental studies that make contact with computational approaches.

AB  - The University Libraries at Virginia Tech established an Open Access Subvention Fund (OASF) in August 2012. Although it began as a two-year pilot project, the Fund has continued to the present. Anyone at Virginia Tech is eligible to apply for funding to offset the cost of an article processing charge to publish in an open access journal. To learn more about user perceptions of the OASF and open access in general, we surveyed everyone who had requested support. The survey, conducted during the fall of 2019, provided a means to gauge the needs of our users, seek feedback on the request and award process, and gather input on the fund guidelines. In this article, we review our findings in the hope that the lessons learned will be useful to other libraries in assessing similar open access subvention funds.

AB  - States will soon have in effect the first major revision of its copyright law since 1909.This revision was made necessary largely by the successful engineering of xerog raphy into increasingly convenient and economic copying machines.The new law legitimizes most examples of single, personal-use copying but severely proscribes multiple and sys tematic copying without copyright-holder authorization.The new law alse makes it clear that an author is entitled to copyright protection from the time his work first exists in tan gible form (e.g., a handwritten draft manuscript), even if the work is not yet registered in the U.S.

AB  - The objective of the session, "Don't Forget The Little Publishers" was to illustrate to the library community and to publishers alike the opportunities to discover and subscribe to high-quality content from small to medium-sized information providers, which to date are overlooked because these information providers lack the resources to effectively market their content.Attendees came away from the session with a much broader understanding of the challenges small publishers must overcome to sell their content; what types of content they are missing; examples of a number of vehicles that are being used to get content out in the market; novel subscription/pricing alternatives; and success stories from those who manage subscriptions.Conversely, attendees also were presented with trends and challenges the library community is facing that may limit future successes, in particular collection sales.The panel concluded by not concluding a clear direction but left it open for the future, as methodologies and internal/external factors of the participants change.

AB  - Successful research object sharing requires that systems and users understand the structure, semantics and rules that govern a given research object collection.&#x0D; A number of metadata standards define ontologies and vocabularies for consistent expression of research object semantics. Supporting, clarifying and sometimes extending these standards are metadata application profiles (MAPs). MAPs play a key role defining metadata element cardinality and data types. MAPs may also mandate or recommend controlled vocabularies, where metadata standards have not already mentioned these in formal range declarations, encoding schemes and semantics that are to be consumed by external systems. MAPs also guide design options for in-house systems and workflows. In this paper, development of a draft MAP for grey-literature policy and research collections is discussed. A focus of the discussion is the considerations around selection and adoption of metadata standards given the research data and literature communities in the APO stakeholder map.&#x0D; This paper presents a work-in-progress version of a Dublin Core Application Profile (DCAP) candidate. The Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory Metadata Application Profile (APO-MAP) takes research object class structure as a starting point and considers class model options, especially given the availability of registry services and Persistent Indenter (PID) systems. The discussion finds that MAP development progresses towards a best fit that balances the need to adopt widely supported standards, local business drivers, and community acceptance.

AB  - The publishers and providers of e‐journals take great pride in the diverse designs of their websites. Yet how these websites present, identify, and link together the publications that they display can make the end‐user task of discov‐ ering articles and accessing them easy, frustrating, or completely fruitless. In 2010, NISO established a workgroup to draft recommended practice guidelines for the presentation and identification of e‐journals (PIE‐J) to help publishers ensure that e‐journal content can be reliably discovered, cited, and accessed by users over time. The recommended practice guidelines emphasize the need to retain the original title and citation information across all journal formats and provide constructive advice to help with the presentation of born‐digital content as well as to support the contin‐ ued digitization of content from journals originally published only in print. The guidelines will be presented to at‐ tendees of this session, along with information on how the guidelines were drafted and how the guidelines relate to other standards and best practices. In an article in Information Standards Quarterly pub‐ lished in spring 2009, Reynolds and Hepfer describe a scenario in which a frustrated undergraduate work‐ ing on a writing assignment faces various challenges in her search for the full text of a specific article start‐ ing with a standard, abbreviated citation to that arti‐ cle. A great deal of the difficulty that the fictional student encounters stems from a lack of standardiza‐ tion in the way in which e‐journals are presented. Various policies and practices have contributed to creating a sometimes overwhelmingly complex online environment for journal content. Since 1971, most U.S. libraries have followed cataloging rules that require each significantly changed title of a jour‐ nal to be cataloged as a separate record; the result is that libraries effectively consider a changed title to have become a new journal for identification, con‐ trol, and inventory purposes. Often the new title has a different ISSN from the old title. Editors may feel content is more marketable if it is presented under the current journal title, and may not reference his‐ torical titles. Product managers and website design‐ ers may seek a simpler and more elegant arrange‐ ment than breaking the content into the various pieces that place it under (multiple) changed titles. Not all content providers either think to consult li‐ brarians or employ librarians to advise on content presentation. In addition to problems with presentation of journal content on the web for readers, there are also diffi‐ culties with link resolvers used by academic and other institutions to connect users with content. Typically, these link resolvers help guide readers to journal articles by using the metadata in Open URLs (ANSI/NISO Z39.88). If the source citation (as repre‐ sented by OpenURL metadata) and the knowledge‐ base identify the same content with different journal titles and ISSN, then the corresponding target links will not be offered to the user. Content that a library has paid for will not be served to a researcher, even though that content has been licensed and should be available to its users. Further, even when guided to the appropriate content by the link resolver, re‐ searchers may be confused by seeing one title in a reference and landing on a page that appears to be an entirely different title. In order to provide publishers and other content providers with practical guidance, the National In‐ formation Standards Organization (NISO) convened a working group on Recommended Practices for the Presentation and Identification of E‐Journals (PIE‐J). PIE‐J is jointly headed by Bob Boissy, Director, Net‐ work Sales, Springer (Robert.Boissy@springer.com)

AB  - No faculty lines were open when I graduated with my MLS at the library where I was employed as a staff member, but I was able to take advantage of organizational restructuring to obtain a management position over interlibrary loan. My department head at the time was assigned with providing copyright assistance. I seized the opportunity to learn more while I searched for a position that required my degree. I was supported while pursuing continuing education in copyright. I was also given increasing responsibilities that I suspected were beyond my rank. My eagerness to develop a professional skill set had worked both for and against me.

AB  - Democratizing access to information is an enabler for our digital future. It can transform how knowledge is created, preserved, and shared, and strengthen the connection between academics and the communities they serve. Yet, open scholarship is influenced by history and politics. This article explores the foundations underlying open scholarship as a quest for more just, equitable, and inclusive societies. It analyzes the origins of the open scholarship movement and explores how systemic factors have impacted equality and equity of knowledge access and production according to location, nationality, race, age, gender, and socio-economic circumstances. It highlights how the privileges of the global North permeate academic and technical standards, norms, and infrastructures. It also reviews how the collective design of more open and collaborative networks can engage a richer diversity of communities, enabling greater social inclusion, and presents key examples. By fostering dialogue with multiple stakeholders, more effective avenues for knowledge production and representation can be built based on approaches that are accessible, participatory, interactive, ethical, and transparent, and that reach a far broader public. This expansive vision of open science will lead to a more unified knowledge economy.

These results and the ensuing discussion highlighted important issues associated with e-publishing formats based on the perspectives of the CJUCE readership. This paper extends that discussion to include a look at overcoming existing criticisms of the peer-review process, current changes in university library holdings, and perspectives of the contributors with respect to e-journal formats.

AB  - With millions of research articles published yearly, the peer review process is in danger of collapsing, especially in "hot" areas with popular conferences. Challenges arise from the large number of manuscripts submitted, skyrocketing use of preprint archives and institutional repositories, problems regarding the identification and availability of experts, conflicts of interest, and bias in reviewing. Such issues can affect the integrity of the reviewing process as well as the timeliness, quality, credibility, and reproducibility of research articles. Several solutions and systems have been suggested, but none work well, and neither authors nor editors are happy with how long it takes to complete reviewing the submitted research. This panel addresses these challenges and potential solutions, including digital libraries that recommend reviewers, as well as broader issues like opportunities for identifying peer reviewers for scholarly journals by engaging doctoral students and postdocs, as well as those who recently completed their Ph.D.

AB  - Medical journals are dull; I do not think there is any doubt about that. —Richard Asher, M.D., F.R.C.P.1 In 1958, Dr. Richard Asher wrote in the British Medical Journal that “medical journals are dull.”1 Among the laundry list of offenses of the publication's format was that “their wrappings [were] so drab and difficult to remove, so the journals accumulate on our desks in inconvenient piles and roll on to the floor.” Over half a century later, we feel the medical and publishing communities have succeeded in making our distinguished journals more to our readers' liking. Much of this success has to do with our journals' growing roles on the Internet, but it was not an easy evolution. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery's first Web site, while a major leap forward, suffered from some of the same symptoms that Asher posited were driving people away from reading journals. Using Asher's example as analogy, our first Web site itself could be considered the “wrappings” to our content; it was the hard-to-manipulate shell that left our online Journal remaining unread somewhere on our readers' computer desktops. The content was superb, as always, but our users could not access it in intuitive, easy, interactive ways, and therefore the content risked going unread. In July of 2009, PRSJournal.com officially became a member of the new, interactive, community-based Web 2.0 that arose after the dot com bust. Stagnant information on a Web page would no longer do; Web sites had to work for their users, not just sit in digital piles. As Kent Anderson, editor-in-chief of the Society for Scholarly Publishing's blog, Scholarly Kitchen, said in 2008, Web 2.0 environments do not just “shovel documents online … [they] bring people and experiences online.”2 Web 2.0 environments such as the new PRSJournal.com keep online journals from succumbing to digital “dullness.” PRSJournal.com underwent a revolutionary transformation when the site was transferred to our publisher's new LWW Journals Web Platform. Once placed on this new platform, immediate changes allowed our Web site, the journal of record, to provide end users with intuitive design and highly useful tools. These first features included a vastly improved search engine, easier-to-read articles, a system for “permalinking” our supplemental digital content and videos, collaborative devices that allow users to mail articles directly to colleagues, enhanced learning tools that enable users to download figures as PowerPoint files, and personalization tools that include the ability for each reader to build his or her own collections of articles, figures, videos, and tables. With the help of Lippincott Williams & Wilkins' Web development teams, PRSJournal.com is continuing to take advantage of and introduce new interactive and interesting Web features to enhance our readers' experiences online. Earlier this year we rolled out our Stand-Alone Video Player exclusively to house our CME video collections. Soon we will be utilizing the player to host true stand-alone videos, starting with a series of lectures and intraoperative videos from the 2010 Baker Gordon Cosmetic Symposium. We hope to bring this series of videos to you each year to provide you with a new multimedia way to improve your understanding of the most cutting edge cosmetic techniques and operations. With our growing video gallery, you will not just be able to read the Journal—you'll be able to watch it, too. Over the summer, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery launched its blog, PRSonally Speaking, which can be found on the home page. We started our blog to share our insights, comments from our esteemed Section Editors, and need-to-know news from the Editorial Office; the blog also enables you to share your thoughts with us. PRSonally Speaking became home to lively, civil debate on hot topics and great discussions pertaining to our field. We encourage you to bookmark us, subscribe to the RSS feed, and join in the ongoing conversation with Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. PRSonally Speaking is an excellent opportunity to have fun, get engaged, and interact with the plastic and reconstructive surgery community. This has always been the community's Journal, but with the blog, the community now provides the opportunity to communicate without submitting an article for print. Also, you may have noticed the new Article as ePUB feature, which launched in July. This is an avant-garde function that allows you to take PRSJournal.com with you in reader-friendly formats for devices, including the Barnes & Noble Nook, Sony eReaders, and the Apple iPad. For readers who want the Journal always at their fingertips without having to carry around any bound volumes, this function will be incredibly useful. In the past year, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery has also started tweeting, so that our readers and “Twitter followers” can have another avenue to keep abreast of the Journal. Follow us at www.twitter.com/prsjournal to obtain information on free content, new additions to the video library, and other Journal news and announcements. Other new features on our Web site that are designed with you in mind include a more robust Publish Ahead of Print selection and our Quick Polls, designed to let you tell us how you feel. Coming soon, PRSJournal will be launching a second release of the LWW Journals Web Platform, giving you access to many more interactive and exciting Web features that will further enhance your Web experience. These features include the Alert Me When Cited function (Fig. 1), which will allow you to sign up for an email alert any time an article of interest is cited by any newer LWW article. In the same vein, two new features will provide a list of LWW articles that cited that article, with links where available, and a ticker that shows the total number of times each articles was cited. These features enable Journal readers to follow their topics of interest beyond PRS; our Journal is part of a larger community, and now, through these citation tools, our readers can follow an article's impact and related topics from journal to journal.Fig. 1.: The Alert Me When Cited function will allow users to sign up for email alerts any time an article of interest is cited by a newer LWW article.Another new feature that will help our readers interact with Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery content in new ways is a tab on the “Most Popular” webpart that shows the Journal's Highest Impact articles. If you enjoy seeing the “most viewed” and “most emailed” articles, then the “highest impact” articles will add a new dimension to your reading of the Journal, allowing you quick access to the Journal's highest impact articles according to the ISI Hot Papers service. Adding additional support to our e-reader presence is a new Journals@LWWiPhone app, which lets readers register and identify their interests, browse Tables of Content, read abstracts, and track their “most viewed articles.” This new app is another example of how PRS content will continue to be offered in new mediums and modes, wherever and however you want to read it. Finally, we will soon be stepping behind the camera with increasing frequency to bring you more videos, including Video Discussions and Introductions by the Editor. With our recent and upcoming Web enhancements, we are taking steps closer to offering our readers the ability to personalize Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery to their own interests. You can already build your own collections of videos, pictures, and more. With the next feature release, you'll be able to track how often your article is cited. Soon you will be able to personalize the PRS experience even further: we will provide the options and you can customize your experience to what you want to read, listen to, watch, collect, and engage. Technology should be in service to the user, not the other way around. We believe these new additions to PRSJournal.com are fully in service of our users. With these changes, we are making the PRSJournal Web site a fully immersive, highly customizable environment that will continue to enhance our readers' experience with PRS content. The days of articles simply being “shoveled” online are long gone; the Journal of record is a vibrant, dynamic, evolving Web site and can be found, as always, at www.PRSJournal.com. If you have any comments or concerns, or any new features or functions you would like to see us implement, please contact us via email, our blog, Twitter … or even a traditional letter to the editor (we still gladly accept those). Our Web site is now anything but dull; let us know how we could be even more exciting. That's what Web 2.0 is all about.

AB  - Passion for digital rights management (DRM) does not typically lure anyone into the library profession; however, DRM is an essential topic for librarians driven to serve their users well. DRM is a daily challenge for libraries and their users, and librarians have a role to play in ensuring public access to information and privacy are considered, counterbalancing the rights of copyright holders. Only by being knowledgeable on the topic can librarians educate and advocate for library users. To this end, Lemmer and Wale have compiled a valuable guide on the basics of DRM for both public and academic librarians. It forms a strong foundation for those unfamiliar with a librarian’s perspective of DRM, and the latter half of the book will be engaging even for experienced librarians. Instructors will be pleased with the sequencing of chapters. They scaffold from basic to more complex concepts, and many of the questions prompted along the way are answered in a subsequent chapter. Though some chapters fall short, most readers will discover something valuable in this collection.

AB  - Electronic Resource Management (ERM) is a specialization that impacts and is impacted by the work of librarians in public services, technical services and systems. All Library and Information Science (LIS) students that wish to work in libraries should have exposure to the concepts and practices of ERM. While LIS programs often convey this knowledge in bits and pieces through existing courses, I believe it is essential to pull this knowledge together into a single course, integrating the various components and providing an overarching perspective on the ERM environment. This presentation conveyed my experience developing an ERM course for the fall semester of 2009. I discussed the combinations of theory, concepts and practice that framed the course and I shared challenges that I encountered. ERM IN PRACTICE AND LIS EDUCATION In 2003, Fisher published an article that posited “the position title of Electronic Resources Librarian has been pre-empted by the public service sector of the profession” (p. 3). It was thought by many at the time that the functions of managing electronic resources would be integrated into the work of existing personnel. As challenges providing technical access to electronic resources arose, systems personnel became involved. As electronic resources proliferated and interfaces evolved, evaluation and selection responsibilities were given to reference and collection development staff. And as licensing terms and pricing schemes became more complex, acquisitions librarians often handled vendor relations and negotiations. ERM management tools have been introduced over the past decade and overall change in the area has slowed, giving libraries to opportunity to more efficiently adapt their organizational structures and workflows to the new environment. Libraries today often have a librarian or team of librarians directly responsible for ERM. Whereas reference and instruction positions may have once included ERM responsibilities, today, ERM positions may include some reference or instruction responsibilities. These inclusions have been declining however. In her study of ERM job announcements from 2000 to 2008, Murdock (2010) noted that “some responsibilities that were considered extraneous to e-resource specific tasks, such as reference service and cataloging, did show an overall declining trend”(p.39). Regardless of the type of library or area of librarianship in which a student may eventually work, she will likely engage in some way with the provision of electronic resources. While new librarians will have the opportunity to learn the specifics of their part in the ERM workflow while on the job, understanding how the work do impacts the work of their colleagues is essential for effective ERM. All students preparing for librarianship would benefit from understanding the big picture of ERM; LIS programs should offer a course dedicated to the subject. Many LIS programs cover this information in bits and pieces through a wide variety of courses, ranging from information organization to reference sources and services. Rarely do students gain knowledge about how the integration of those bits and pieces occurs in practice. This

AB  - Open access is one of the prime motivators in the transformation of scholarly communication in the twenty-first century academy. While most of the attention of the movement has been focused on the work of faculty and graduate students, undergraduate researchers also offer great potential to be catalysts for change. The UNT Libraries have taken on an active role in encouraging and educating the UNT community on Open Access issues, including implementation of their Open Access Policy, providing repository services that support Open Access, participation in International Open Access Week, and year-round seminars on the importance of Open Access initiatives. This paper describes the importance of Open Access, its impact on the academic community and scholars, and initiatives of the UNT Libraries and Honors College for Open Access outreach.

AB  - This book, the sixth volume in a series on the twenty-first century academic library, joins other books on the present and future of technical services, including Rethinking Library Technical Services (2015) and the much older Technical Services: Today and Tomorrow (1998); it presents a mixture of theory and praxis and includes surveys of the state of the profession, case studies, and think pieces. Unlike the other two volumes mentioned, it does not have chapters specifically devoted to acquisitions or to electronic resources management; metadata creation is the only division discussed in detail. However, it does include two sections aimed at technical services managers, a demographic not often treated separately.

AB  - In 2020, LYRASIS Research conducted a member survey of predominantly United States (U.S.) higher education libraries to understand the spectrum of attitudes and actions related to Open Access (OA). The results indicated that the U.S. approach to OA is decentralised, lacking the focused trends that are apparent in other areas of the world. The diversity among types of colleges and universities in the U.S. is revealed through discussions about support or lack thereof for APCs, crowdfunding models, preprint repositories, the Subscribe to Open approach, and more. The array of OA approaches that garner support in the U.S. may appear confusing as we strive for scale in our efforts. LYRASIS has used its research findings, in combination with our deep understanding of U.S. higher education libraries, to develop a collaborative approach towards OA that provides multiple incentives and opportunities for libraries serving all types of institutions to engage. This article, expanding on the LIBER 2021 Conference Presentation of the same name, will outline the results of the survey, the conclusions LYRASIS has drawn, and our work to develop an inclusive approach to a variety of OA initiatives. Our understanding of the landscape of U.S. higher education has led us to develop or support several significant recent OA initiatives, including a fund for OA ebooks focused on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals topics and the establishment of the LYRASIS Open Access Community Investment Program (OACIP).

AB  - Changes in Academic Communication.Academic communication refers to the process that scholars and researchers all over the world spread and share relevant academic researches through various channels.In the traditional printing age, academic communication is mainly conducted through open channels such as publishing books and periodicals, etc.With the expansion of the Internet, there are richer and richer channels for academic communication.For example, scholars can use communication tools such as the virtual network forum (BBS), blog, micro blog, e-mail and social network like SNS, and instant communication tools such as QQ and MSN, etc.Publishers' Monopoly, Price Increase and Insufficient Library Funds.Academic publishers' monopoly over academic resources and constant price increase greatly restrict the conduction of academic communication and exchange activities as well as the possibility of conducting academic research innovation.Many organizations and institutions are trying to reform the current academic exchange and publish models.Some scholars believe that an ideal model is that commercialized publishers no longer participate in the process of exchanging and sharing academic information between scholars and researchers.Promotion of Academic Search Engine.As a large amount of academic information of the digital format is on the Internet, commercially operated search engines begin to dabble into the search of academic information and resources relying on the massive web database and search technology.Many students, teachers and technology workers are becoming increasingly inclined to using academic search engine to search academic information.Of course, these academic search engines, whether free or not, have brought convenience for scientific research, but they also take away some readers that should originally belong to libraries.[1]

AB  - The complexity of usage reporting for Open Access (OA) content continues to grow, particularly with content syndication to organizations such as ScienceDirect and ResearchGate, which deliver content across multiple platforms at an unprecedented scale. What kind of usage data do diverse stakeholders (including libraries, publishers, authors, and editors) need? Can the work done to support OA book usage data analytics use cases inform OA article and data use cases? What standards and policies are required to ensure the usage data is accurate and meaningful? What infrastructure is needed to collect and disseminate this data effectively and efficiently? This paper brings together four different perspectives to consider these questions: an OA publisher, a research infrastructure, an emerging usage data trust, and a usage analytics service provider. The authors walk through what is known, and then start to unpack the questions for which they do not yet have answers. Their goal is to inform the community’s understanding of the challenges ahead and, hopefully, start to lay the groundwork for constructive policies and shared solutions.

AB  - In the face of budget challenges, organizational strategy changes, and the new open access (OA) policy, the Pennsylvania State University Libraries (PSUL) are reevaluating negotiations and collections of ‘big deal’ journal packages. While a growing number of libraries are considering cancelling subscriptions to ‘big deals’, PSUL has been taking a careful approach in containing cost and making sure that faculty and students have access to resources that they need. Current efforts include: renegotiating ‘big deals’; cancelling low value titles in title-by-title agreements; obtaining single agreements for the entire Penn State; promoting green OA for future subscription negotiation purposes; and renegotiating OA related licensing terms. To achieve greater efficiency of acquisitions workflows and increase university-wide purchasing power, reallocation of the collection budget will be discussed in the near future. Auto deposit of accepted manuscripts from any Penn State author into ScholarSphere, Penn State’s institutional repository, as well as exploration of other OA models are also under consideration.

AB  - Following the emergence of electronic resources (e-resources), librarians developed licensing guidelines, standards, models, and understandings to educate, increase efficiencies, and retain rights afforded by copyright law. To reduce licensing burdens, the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) released the Shared E-Resource Understanding (SERU) in 2008, a set of “understandings” created and agreed upon by libraries and vendors. The author conducted a survey in 2017 of licensing practices and SERU use at libraries. The survey analyzed 108 responses from US academic libraries signing at least one license in the twelve months preceding the survey.

AB  - When I hear the phrase "artificial intelligence" (AI), immediately my mind goes to robots and self-driving cars and rovers used for space exploration.In other words, I associate AI with complicated tasks that impact only a few of us.But the reality is that AI is everywhere around us, in ways that we might not even realize.We use digital assistants like Siri and Alexa to help us answer questions, make purchases for us, even to make us laugh (my daughters taught me that Alexa tells jokes).And who hasn't used Waze or Google Maps to get from point A to B? Or how about the social media we engage in daily and the content we are served on those platforms?Even autocorrect on our phones and in our word-processing documents are examples of AI.Thanks to the advancement of data collection and analysis, ever-faster computer processing, and the expansion of connected devices, nearly every industry has been impacted by AI in the past several years.For example, there has been the growth of autonomous cars in transportation, the use of robots working alongside humans in manufacturing, the advancement of diagnosing disease through machine-read imaging, and the automation of reporting and processes in finance (1).The scientific research enterprise is no different.

AB  - This study examines how academic libraries in the UK responded to the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 open access policy. Thirteen information professionals at twelve institutions across the UK took part in semi-structured interviews. Findings from the interviews reveal how libraries created and deployed new infrastructures, workflows, and staffing as well as the methods through which universities communicated the policy’s requirements. The study describes respondents’ experiences of the changes brought about by REF 2021 as well as their thoughts on how the REF 2021 open access policy will affect future REF assessments. Results provide insight for libraries responding to US initiatives such as the August 2022 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy memo directing the open publishing of federally funded research.

AB  - In their introduction to Academic E-Books: Publishers, Librarians and Users, editors Ward, Freeman and Nixon list the potential promises of e-books to libraries: they cannot be lost or damaged, they do not require staffing to check-in and out and shelf, they take up no space, they can be purchased on demand, they can be checked out by multiple users, and they are often searchable. These promises are particularly enticing when so much scholarship is done through online journal databases and when library service models are shifting from a focus on physical collections to an emphasis on creating spaces for collaborative scholarship. However, e-books also present challenges that the editors summarize in two statements: “1) lack of sufficient content and 2) users’ stated preference for print books in many cases” (2). The Academic E-Books contributors flesh out these issues through specific examples from the publishing industry, libraries, user experience and case studies. They also demonstrate how libraries are combatting challenges to successfully integrate, and in some cases replace print with, e-book collections.

AB  - print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself." 1That said, open access is applied in different ways; i.e., OA doesn't always imply that you can reuse research articles for "any lawful purpose."Articles may be cost-free to read but still subject to publisher policies that limit other uses.Educational materials, data, and code, which MIT researchers routinely create and release publicly, may also be made openly available under different terms.Open access may have begun simply because the web allowed for easy sharing, but it has evolved into a complex movement with political, social, and economic dimensions.The scholarly journal publishing system is unique in that researchers contribute their articles with no expectation of payment; at the same time, some publishers charge ever-increasing subscription fees, restrict authors' rights to reuse work, or both.Variations in the type of open access that will help "fix" the system are at the heart of debates among researchers, funders, librarians, and publishers.This white paper is the first deliverable of the OA task force.Its goal is to give MIT students, staff, and faculty an overview of the open access landscape at MIT, in the United States, and in Europe to help inform discussions at the Institute over the next year.These discussions, which will take place at community forums and in other venues, including the task force idea bank, will help inform the task force as it develops a set of recommendations across a broad spectrum of scholarly outputs, including articles and books, data, educational materials, and code.Part I of this paper provides an overview of current OA policies and movements in Europe and the United States as a way to give broader context to what open access means in practice internationally.Part II explores MIT researchers' approaches in terms of making their publications, data, code, and educational materials openly available.

In order to be good stewards of their resources, collection managers should always be aware of digital rights management (DRM) restrictions and access issues when contemplating an e‐book purchase. This can be difficult due to the wide variety of publishing models employed by society e‐book publishers. In this study the authors examine various life and physical science societies that publish e‐books, including factors such as DRM and access conditions, and purchasing options. The results provide information for collection managers to consider when purchasing e‐books from society publishers, as well as allows them to advise patrons when access to ebooks may be limited to society members.

AB  - An Investigative Analysis on the Utilization of the Essential Electronic Agricultural Library (TEEAL) by Researchers: A Case Study of National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM) Library. Oyeniyi J. Oluwakemi; Olaifa Taye Paul; Uzokwe Chuka Christian; Alu Fredrick; Oyewopo Adewale Oyekunle Abstract This research work seeks to investigate the rate of utilization of electronic library and in particular, The Essential Electronic Agricultural Library (TEEAL) by researchers. While analysing the data in this research work, it was discovered that although 99% of the respondents have heard about TEEAL and the usefulness, only very few of the respondents actually utilize the electronic library. This poor utilization was however linked to several points such as poor power supply, inadequate computer systems in the library and limitations in the accessibility of the library due to working hours. The researchers of this work however discovered that researchers still prefer other means of sourcing research information such as Google search and periodicals, which can be easily accessed via the mobile telephone and related devices.

AB  - This paper deals with the efficiency of publication means within the scientific community.Scientists spend a substantial part of their total time in visiting meetings and conferences, reading publications, writing emails, etc.Thus any improvements in the communication processes, in particular technologies which minimize non-value adding activities such as tedious retrieving of source material from library shelves, could have far-reaching (positive) consequences.In this respect a customized solution for the digitalization of paper-based conference proceedings is presented.The process of creating electronic copies of papers -disseminating knowledge on CAAD -in pdf-format is described as well as the respective decisions which were taken in this context.

AB  - Ray Kurzweil is one of those fortunate persons who is led forward in life largely by his curiosity.Some would say he's as close as we can get to having Thomas Edison living amongst us.Some would write him off as a nut.But if so, he's a really smart nut.His inventions, taken together, reveal a breathtaking span of disciplines, interests, and pursuits: Electronic music, Optical Character Recognition, Artificial Intelligence -and now, an eReader software package.I first ran across mention of Blio many months ago.Navigating to http://www.blio.combrought one to a simple page saying, "Coming Soon!" What were they promising?A new kind of eBook reader -"…what eReading should be…"Well this all sounded very interesting, so I signed up to receive alerts about Blio.Months went by.Nothing.I'd stop by the site from time to time -nothing appeared to have changed.Then, a few days ago -late September -I received an email message from Blio containing a link to a download page.Blio has been released -for Windows, at present, but with apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android promised soon.So -"what eReading should be," eh?What's that?Again quoting from the site, "Blio displays books in full color, with fonts, pictures, and layout as the publisher intended."Hmmm.How does it do that?Sounds like PDF or something, right?Well -sort of… Blio understands two formats at present, ePub and XPS.XPS is Microsoft's XML Paper Specification, which in turn has been standardized as OpenXPS by Ecma International (which began life as the European Computer Manufacturers Association but which became a Geneva-based, private standards body).Wikipedia has a decent article on OpenXPS, describing it as, "…an XML-based (more precisely XAMLbased) specification, based on a new print path and a color-managed vector-based document format that supports device independence and resolution independence.OpenXPS was standardized as an open standard document format on June 16, 2009."XPS differs from PDF in that PDF is, again quoting Wikipedia, "…a database of objects, created from PostScript and also directly generated from many applications, whereas XPS is based on XML." Indeed, XPS has been used by recent versions of Windows as the print spooler format, meaning that Windows 7, for example, includes a native XPS viewer with the operating system.The viewer, in effect, shows the user a view of the document (again from Wikipedia), "…created by printing to the virtual XPS printer driver."As XPS emerged as a document format, a whole raft of third-party tools began to support it: its creation, editing, manipulation, conversion, rendering, etc.The Blio download also installs Microsoft PlayReady, which Microsoft's official PlayReady site describes as, "…a content access and protection technology…optimized for the mobile industry to support the growth of online content services…" In other words, DRM.

AB  - Expert testimony is an important part of criminal and civil litigation whenever scientific evidence needs to be explained and interpreted for the judge and jury. Those appearing in court as expert witnesses must possess the necessary qualifications, skill, training, and experience for the task in hand. Unlike a lay-witness, an expert witness is allowed to render an opinion based on their own specialized knowledge and research. In the adversarial system of justice, expert witnesses are hired by opposing sides in a case and this causes confusion when they disagree about the strengths and weaknesses of the scientific evidence presented. Choosing the best expert witness is often a difficult task and making a wrong decision has sometimes led to wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice. Success in science is tightly linked to the quantity and quality of a person's scholarly publications in academic journals in some particular area of research and scholarship. This article describes the use of a publicly available citation database to investigate the publication and citation records of British forensic practitioners with "legal and forensic medicine" (LFM) as their primary or secondary research category. How to attribute credit to individual names on multi-authored articles is a major problem in science and academia. Six different citation metrics, including authorship position on highly cited articles, were used to derive a composite citation score (c-score) for each highly cited scientist. Such bibliometric methods could prove useful in jurisprudence when reviewing the qualifications of people suggested to serve as expert witness in court cases.

AB  - O n August 25, 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued a memorandum on Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research, also known as the Nelson Memorandum, that significantly alters the open scholarship landscape. The new policy guidance advances previous federal policy in a number of impactful ways. The directive applies to all federal agencies, removes the previous 12-month embargo period on article sharing, directs federal agencies to update their policies on data sharing to enable immediate access to the data underlying published studies, expands the definition of publications, calls for agencies to share publication metadata and to require the use of persistent identifiers (PIDs), and more. The Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS) responded right away, convening members for a virtual briefing by Alondra Nelson, who at the time served as deputy assistant to the president and deputy director for science and society of the White House OSTP, and Christopher Marcum, then-assistant director for open science and data policy at the OSTP. Both contextualized the public access guidance within the Biden Administration’s larger priorities and described how climate change, social inequity, and COVID-19 are compelling, real-world examples of the critical and urgent need for release of data. Additionally, the policy is an important part of upholding and supporting research integrity to protect and restore public trust in scholarship, to help keep track of investments, and maintain accountability through a public record. The Nelson Memorandum offers higher education the opportunity to promote equity and transparency in research through public access compliance. However, colleges and universities are responsible for implementing changes (to infrastructure, policies, training, and more) to comply with new and changing requirements.

AB  - In a Last Words piece at the end of 2009, the editor of this journal suggested that moving Computational Linguistics to open access and electronic-only availability was just the beginning of a sequence of changes we might see in how the journal operates.In fact, I think this step was, for the Computational Linguistics journal, the beginning of the end.But this isn't a bad thing: it's a positive thing that CL has started down this road before many of its competitors.We should be accelerating the pace towards the demise of the traditional journal.In an age where most of us have our own Web pages, and many of us have our own blogs, it's possible to publish ideas without the inexcusable delays introduced by the reviewing process and the trappings of "professional publishing."The journal is dead as a mode of scholarly communication because it's a stultified and outmoded way of disseminating research findings.Here are some reasons why I think this is the case.

AB  - Libraries, consortia, and publishers are exploring new models to support Open Access (OA) content. Native OA journal publishers are facing a different set of challenges as there is no existing library subscription base to transform into support for OA. Author-pays OA models are challenging to the ecosystem for a variety of reasons. Large institutions with heavy scholarly output may pay more, small institutions that use the content but publish less are wondering what role they will play, and authors from the global south may not have funding to pay Article Processing Charges (APCs). What new models are under exploration to address the complexity of funder mandates, reduce administrative burden of complex APC models, and the need to be more inclusive of a diverse community?

AB  - Fundamentals of Managing Collections. By Carol A. Singer. Chicago: ALA, 2012. 167 p. $60 paperback (ISBN: 978-0-8389-1153-2). ALA Fundamentals Series. This book is part of the ALA Fundamentals Series and may serve as a targeted supplement to more general collection development works. Since most libraries still have print reference collections and librarians are struggling to integrate electronic titles with existing print collections, the topics covered in this guide will be relevant to many practitioners. Singer herself says that the reference stacks are full of useful resources, but admits to rarely consulting them. She then posits that a leaner print collection might gain more use, Her information on maintaining reference collections covers not only strategies for taming the physical reference collection, but 'also suggestions for incorporating virtual materials into that reference collection and the additional challenges of managing electronic resources. Singer divides her work into nine chapters: Reference Fundamentals; Reference Development Policies; Staffing Models for Management; Selecting Materials; Acquisitions, Budgets, and Licenses; Collection Maintenance; Weeding the Collection; Reference Development and Consortia; Discovery and Access; and a Collection Development Policy Template in an appendix. Singer begins with some definitions of reference works and continues her discussion with the electronic aspect of reference collections. She then describes the relationship between print and electronic materials, and compares these two types of resources. Singer also considers how to define boundaries for both print and electronic collections. In the next chapter, Singer provides a rationale for a separate reference collection development policy, as well as a very thorough discussion of each of the desirable components of such a policy. The chapter on staffing applies only to larger libraries but clearly delineates centralized and decentralized models for managing reference collections. Singer also provides lists of advantages and disadvantages for both models. The next topic is selection. Singer discusses some of the tools available to assist with selection and general criteria for choosing resources. She follows this introduction with specific selection criteria for different types of reference materials: online, aggregated reference book databases, freely available Internet resources, print monographs, and print serials. In the following chapter, Singer provides a broad overview of the acquisitions process, including approval plans. With the exception of a reference to typing paper order forms, the workflows Singer outlines are fairly standard. She continues with a general discussion of various models for reference collection budgets. Singer then briefly covers some of the major components of licenses. In the next chapter, the focus is on collection maintenance. Singer discusses potential worldlows when new electronic resources are added (testing, branding, cataloging, etc. …

AB  - Due to impending campus-wide downsizing, the Grand Valley State University (GVSU) Libraries projected that a worst-case scenario would result in a 14% cut to the library’s collections budget for fiscal year 2020. In the same year, GVSU Libraries welcomed several new members of its leadership team, including the dean, two associate deans, head of systems, head of collections, business administrator, and a vacancy after the long-time acquisitions manager retired. Budget cuts and staff turnover are tough, but they prompted a much-needed reassessment of roles, culture, and priorities in the library. Different approaches to spending and curating the library’s collections were vital to counteract the budgetary challenges. Cara Cadena, the new head of collections, was charged with building a task force to recommend cancellations and a plan to communicate these changes across campus. Decisions were made based on feedback gathered from teaching faculty, liaison librarians, campus stakeholders, and usage data. Ultimately, the communication plan proved to be the most critical--and challenging--part of the process. In this session, Cara and Marcia will discuss successes, missteps, results, the importance of vendor relationships, and future plans for collection management at GVSU. Attendees will gain insights into leveraging stakeholder buy-in and grasping opportunities amidst constant change (and decreased funding) in order to evolve effectively. They’ll also learn how GVSU Libraries are reimagining the role of the collections team.

AB  - Following a common thread from throughout OSI2016, this workgroup will develop partnership proposals for this community to work together to improve the culture of communication inside academia, particularly inside research. As part of this effort, it may be important to clarify messaging surrounding the benefits and impacts of open access (OA) inside academia, particularly inside research. It may also be important to determine what resources and information are needed before this messaging can be effective, including showing the benefits of OA to a skeptical research community; addressing the many concerns of stakeholders; clearly explaining its pros and cons; and demonstrating the case for why the transition to OA is worth the trouble.

AB  - Forensics of digital data are concerned with identifying, acquiring, processing, analysing, and reporting on electronic data. Multimedia forensics focuses on investigating computer crimes using forensic methods. The analysis of multimedia evidence is the role of multimedia forensics, on the other hand. In the analysis, digital evidence is evaluated scientifically to maintain its integrity, to find its source, and to authenticate it. There are several methods in multimedia forensics, such as the implementation of deep learning. The purpose of this research is to conduct bibliometric analysis in multimedia forensics and deep learning by using the data gathered from Scopus index on the keyword “multimedia forensics and deep learning”. The result is 68 relevant papers were found in the range of 2017-2022. The results of this research can be used by researchers as a reference when conducting research and determining the research themes to be pursued.

AB  - Beginning in 2011, there have been several policy changes directly affecting the management, preservation, and accessibility of publically funded research and resulting research data in the United States. On January 18, 2011 the National Science Foundation (NSF) required data management plans to be submitted with all grant proposals (National Science Foundation, 2013). On February 22, 2013, the Office of Science and Technology Policy of the President of the United States extended a similar requirement to all federal agencies that have a research and development budget of more than $100 million (Holdren, 2013). These requirements illustrate the need for further coordination and management of data as scholarship and traditional scholarship in integrated publishing solutions.

AB  - Academic libraries across North America are restructuring to meet user needs in an e-preferred environment, resulting in major changes to traditional collection development roles and workflows. Responsibility for collection work is increasingly assigned to functional librarians dedicated to collection development activities across a broad range of subject areas, often serving an entire faculty or college. This paper discusses the history, process, and outcomes of the transition to functional collection development roles at two mid-sized universities. Both Carleton University and the University of Guelph support a wide range of undergraduate and graduate research needs from a single central library, but have implemented a different type of organizational design and are at different stages in the restructuring process. One year into their new functional roles, Carleton’s librarians are preparing to assess the state of change around collection development in their organization, and identify next steps for the restructuring process. By contrast, the University of Guelph has worked with a functional team model for ten years, and is undertaking a 10-year review to assess whether the original goals of the reorganization were met. How does collections work compare under a functional team model, compared to a traditional liaison model? Both perspectives offer strategies for consultation and change management that may be helpful to other institutions restructuring their collection development activities.

AB  - Background: Although opinions of scientists about open access and the importance of their skills in information literacy have been investigated earlier but not, to our knowledge, of those in Croatia. Objective: The objective was to analyse the opinions on open access and on open-science practices before implementing open-science policies. Methods: Scientists at the University of Rijeka (N = 1256) were invited to complete, anonymously, an online questionnaire on open science (Google Forms) in 2020 and their responses were analysed. Results: Altogether 192 participants (a response rate 15%) were involved in this study, of which 110 (57%) were women. The mean age of the participants was 42 years (stand-ard deviation 11). The participants pursued careers in biomedical (37%), social (31%), or technical (14%) sciences; 20% were early-career researchers or postdoctoral research-ers, and 80% held the rank of assistant professor or higher. Most of them (88%) agreed that journals should be open access and 77% said they would choose the open-access journal if they had to choose between two journals with similar impact factors. Most (83%) considered publishing fees (article processing charges) to be too high; fewer than half (45%) considered the impact factor to be more important than open access; and 28% believed open access journals to be of lower quality. Nearly three-fourths (74%) had published at least one article in an open access journal, and 45%, without paying any fee. Only a few (10.9%) archived their articles in institutional or national repositories; more than a quarter (27%), on their web pages; and close to half (43%), on their social networks. To obtain papers not available to read online, more than half (56%) used Sci-Hub; slightly more than half (51%) wrote to the authors; 40% asked col-leagues for help; and 35% approached a librarian. Conclusions: Most of the scientists in our study were in favour of open access but con-sidered the publication fees to be too high. Their archiving was inadequate: few used any institutional or national repositories. Therefore, the scientists need to be more information literate and require guidance and help from librarians and will benefit from training in information literacy including the principles of open access.

AB  - Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, libraries in the higher education arena had already implemented a combined virtual/real-world service model. Books could be checked out and read in print or online; research assistance could be sought at the reference desk or via instant messaging, email, or phone; and both in-person and remote instruction existed for onsite and offsite classes. However, the pandemic forced the 2020 shutdown, and libraries had to move to a completely online environment. In the public services realm, there was an emphasis on online learning, especially asynchronous learning. The range of knowledge librarians had of online education ran from considerable experience to truly little or none.

AB  - Typesetting systems, such as LATEX, permit users to define custom markup and corresponding formatting to simplify authoring, ensure the consistent presentation of domain-specific recurring elements and, potentially, enable further processing, such as the generation of an index of such elements. In XML-based and similar systems, the separation of content and form is also reflected in the processing pipeline: while document authors can define custom markup, they cannot define its semantics. This could be said to be intentional to ensure structural integrity of documents, but at the same time it limits the expressivity of markup. The latter is particularly true for so-called lightweight markup languages like Mark-down, which only define very limited sets of generic elements. This vision paper sketches an approach for user-defined semantic markup that could permit authors to define the semantics of elements by formally describing the relations between its constituent parts and to other elements, and to define a formatting intent that would ensure that a default presentation is always available.

AB  - The rapid change in scholarly communication and knowledge management has transformed the repository services and imposed new skills and competencies for repository management. This study is posed to assess the skills and competencies of librarians for repository management and scholarly communication in academic institutions in Nigeria. The study adopted a survey research design to assess the skills and competencies of the librarians using NASIG “Core Competencies for Scholarly Communication Librarians 2017”. The sample size of the study comprises 120 librarians across 40 institutions. The findings of the study indicate among others that; 74 % of the librarians have a general understanding of repository platforms, 54.17% background knowledge of open access movement, and 58% experience in advocacy for open access. At the same time, 83.3% of the librarians can capture, store, and preserve the research output. While 62.3% understand research impact, only 35.8% understand emerging alternatives measures of the impact. Although, 73.1 % understand Data description and storage, only 20.8% understand text and data mining. The study concluded that awareness, skills, and competencies of the librarians is increasing and recommends among others; setting up a framework for the employment of repository and scholarly communication librarians and training on repository management and scholarly communication.

AB  - Abstract Unser Aufsatz hat zahlreiche Kriterien entwickelt, mit denen die Bibliometrie und Szientometrie des auf akademische Bücher spezialisierten Verlagswesens betrieben werden kann. Wir testen den Einfluss von Messgrößen, wie sie auf Grund von Altmetrics, Entlehnungsstatistiken, Libcitation nach OCLC Worldcat und anderen Unionskatalogen in Industrie- und Entwicklungsländern, subjektivem Ranking durch academic communities und Zitierungen im Book Citation Index gewonnen werden können. 57 global operierende Buchverlage, über die sämtliche Daten vorhanden sind, stehen dabei im Mittelpunkt. All diese Daten haben eine Relevanz für die Publikationsstrategie-Beratung der Wissenschaft durch die Bibliotheksdienste im 21. Jahrhundert. Die Innovation dieses Aufsatzes besteht vor allem in der Verwendung von neuen Daten über die Publikationspräferenz zweier renommierter akademischer communities in Europa, nämlich Dänemark (landesweit) und von der Reichsuniversität Groningen in den Niederlanden in der multivariaten Analyse. Unsere Auswertungen zeigen, dass sowohl Ansätze, die auf die Zitierungen im Book Citation Index oder auf Größen der Libcitation (globale Verbreitung im OCLC Worldcat) ausschließlichen Wert legen, die komplexe Realität des heutigen internationalen Publikationswesens nicht erfassen. Anders als Prototheorien des globalen Publikationswesens bisher annahmen, haben die Daten des Book Citation Index oder Libcitation (globale Verbreitung im OCLC Worldcat) keine besondere Bedeutung für die Publikationsentscheidungen der dänischen und niederländischen Wissenschaftler. Bei den dänischen Wissenschaftlern scheint der Faktor „size and high quality“ der ausschlaggebende zu sein. Für Groningen kommt als determinierender Faktor noch die international anerkannte Verlagsqualität hinzu. Vergleiche unserer Ergebnisse mit den landesweiten subjektiven Verlagseinschätzungen der einzigen Wissenschaftscommunity, wo solche Daten erhoben wurden (Spanien) bestätigen unsere multivariaten Ergebnisse.

Seizing a moment of opportunity in a rapidly shifting digital research landscape, the two organizations “spun in” to each other in order to leverage their complementary mandates and overlapping memberships. The new merged organization is now better positioned to meet the challenges of collaborative work in research and Canadian heritage content acquisition and access.

AB  - Surat Keterangan Pendamping Ijazah (SKPI) sangat berharga bagi para lulusan perguruan tinggi yang sedang mencari pekerjaan, oleh karena itu rentan terhadap pemalsuan dan manipulasi. Blockchain merupakan teknologi basis data terdistribusi yang mendukung integritas data, keterbukaan, dan ketelurusuran. Teknologi ini tepat digunakan untuk mencatat dan menyimpan surat berharga sebagai suatu aset digital yang bersifat terbuka dan interoperable. Untuk itu standard ERC721 digunakan untuk merepresentasikan SKPI sebagai Non Fungible Token. Penelitian ini membangun sistem penerbitan SKPI sebagai aset digital dalam standar NFT yang membutuhan ekosistem pengembangan teknologi Web3. Sistem berhasil dibangun, diimplementasikan, dan diujicobakan pada sebuah jaringan blockchain (Test-Net).

AB  - This study examines the Use and Awareness of N-List resources by the Studentsin SJM College of Arts, Science and Commerce Chitradurga. A survey method was adopted for this study and a well-structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to the students of SJM College of Arts, Science and Commerce. The survey revealed that 97% of respondents have an awareness of N-List e-resources. More than 75% of respondents got awareness about N-List through a user education program conducted by the library. 77% of respondents use N-List resources daily. 'Annual reviews', 'Cambridge University Press' and 'Royal Society of Chemistry' are the most popular e-journals used by the respondents through N-List consortia. Moreover, the E-resources accessed through the N-list program satisfy the majority of respondents. This study recommends that library staff need to conduct periodic orientation and user education programs to create more awareness among library users about E-resources available through N-ListConsortia.

AB  - This slim, easily read volume is a compilation of papers presented at a conference, “Digital Information and Knowledge Management: New Opportunities for Research Libraries,” sponsored by the University of Oklahoma Libraries and held March 3–4, 2005, in Oklahoma City. As such, it provides a snapshot of the thinking at that time about these topics and features glimpses of opportunities for libraries in the twenty-first century.Keynote speaker Kaufman provides an overview of where libraries have been and where they are heading. Her advice to those working in this transformed future is to make choices that will help research libraries integrate themselves into the fabric of university life and research. Dillon asserts, “the future of libraries is likely to be where it has always been, in providing a particular community with value-added information services that they cannot get elsewhere” (p. 39) by focusing on and promoting what they do and do well. By comparing two digital library projects, Panitch and Michalak emphasize the need for research libraries to focus on performing work of a scholarly nature in this arena. Baker shares information about projects, both successful and not, so that research librarians can continue their long tradition of collaboration to make future changes. She suggests that in general librarians are ahead of the curve compared to their faculty when it comes to seeing the need to change how information and knowledge are handled and disseminated. Cullen warns of the dangers of simply being overwhelmed by the rapid increase of information and challenges readers to take measures that make it useful to others. What new skills and experiences will librarians of the future need? Baker answers this question in her paper. The final chapter by Shirk describes ways the tools for visualizing information might be applied by librarians to create an improved map of library collections.Much has changed since the 2005 conference that serves as the basis of this book. Libraries, for example, are in partnership with Google to better organize and retrieve digital information. New tools in the area of social networking are being applied daily in libraries as research librarians reach out to their users and meet them in their spaces, thus integrating themselves into the campus fabric. This book provides an excellent historical overview of the issues and concerns of research librarians around digital information and knowledge management. After reading it, those wishing to learn about current applications and challenges should consult the journal literature.

AB  - Since internationally visible scientific productivity is a criterion for state evaluation of Croatian academic and scientific institutions and their scientists, Croatian academic libraries have a key role in quantitative evaluation of scientific productivity using methods such as bibliometrics, scientometrics and the like. The aim of this case study is to identify and illustrate the current situation of library services for evaluating scientific production at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, and to make recommendations for the further development of such services, which could serve as a framework for the systematic implementation of this type of service in all libraries at the University of Zagreb and beyond. More specifically, the purpose of this paper was to identify the existence of the bibliometric services in the libraries of the University of Zagreb (UNIZG), examine the status and involvement of university librarians in the academic advancement procedures and to identify the required competences for bibliometric experts in Croatia. The research was conducted using the content analysis method, the survey method, and the focus group method. The research results show that although UNIZG libraries are integrated into the system of academic promotion and the role of UNIZG libraries is enshrined in Croatian regulations, the bibliometric service is not standardised at the University level. The results also indicate that the service needs to be strengthened in terms of training of professional staff and greater investment in staff capacity and infrastructure. The fact that the study was conducted at a single Croatian university is a possible limitation that could relate to the application of guidelines for further actions and the development of bibliometric services at national level. It would therefore be desirable to conduct future research to identify the situation at other Croatian universities as well. It would also be necessary to determine the open science and open access policies at UNIZG through further research and, in this context, to establish guidelines for possible improvements in the processes of evaluating scientific productivity. The results of this study make an important contribution to the possible future positioning of university libraries and UNIZG librarians in the process of evaluating scientific productivity. In addition, some practical advice is given so that this case study may be a good introductory overview for the wider academic community in relation to this topic.

AB  - The use of the Internet is one of the solutions to tackle the communication problems during the covid-19 pandemic. Online activity, which can be done to facilitate learning a language, especially English, is preferable to be synchronous and asynchronous online communication. This research focuses on using asynchronous online communication of the learning management system to enhance students' writing ability in pre-intermediate writing subjects during the covid-19 pandemic. The method of the research is a quantitative method with One-Group Pretest-posttest design. The research population is the second-semester students, and the sample of the research is pre-intermediate writing class C, which consists of 23 students. The data analysis results show that the student's average score on the pre-test is 76.96, and the mean score of the post-test is 79.83, which means that the mean score of the post-test is higher than the mean score of the pre-test. In other words, the gained score is 2.87. Wilcoxon test for non-parametric statistics is applied to decide the hypothesis. The calculation of the test statistic showed that the z test result is 2.62 with a 2-tailed significance is 0.009. It indicates that the result is significant since 0.009 is less than 0.05 (0.009 &lt; 0.05). It means that the Null hypothesis (H0) is rejected, while the Alternative hypothesis (H1) is accepted. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a significant effect of using asynchronous online communication of the learning management system (www.schoology.com) on students' writing ability. The study implies that this LMS model is visible in ELT, especially to improve the students' four skills, such as writing ability.

AB  - This article focuses on the construction of open mobile knowledge base (OMKB) in higher vocational colleges (HVCs), and adopts the methodologies of documental analysis, questionnaires, surveys and case studies to analyze OMKB in HVCs in China. Then, through the analysis of domestic and foreign data, it can be seen that the current storage volume of knowledge base of scientific research results in Chinese universities is far below the level of western developed countries. Conducting the construction of OMKB in HVCs can better comply with the trend of social development, meet the knowledge needs of the public, and form the complementarity between different institutions. However, in reality, there are still some problems and deficiencies in the OMKB service mode of HVCs, which emphasize information collection rather than knowledge application, paper literature rather than electronic data, on-campus service rather than social service, and existing knowledge rather than creative consciousness. Therefore, on the basis of full investigation and analysis, this paper proposes that the optimization path of the OMKB service mode in China›s HVCs is: exploring the joint mode of cooperation between universities and society, and operation and management, improving the system platform and funding sources, and making good storage and sharing of resources. The innovation of the OMKB service mode of HVCs in China can achieve the following: carrying out innovation and improvement, laying social foundation, promoting innovation of resource evaluation system, protecting the innovation of intellectual property mode, co-construction of the HVCs’ alliance knowledge base system innovation, technological innovation, - applying the advanced technology of CRIS, helping China’s HVCs’ knowledge base construction transformation and upgrading.

AB  - In November 2021, with the support of the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) and cOAlition S, four ‘task and finish’ working groups were established. The authors facilitated and supported these groups. Each group was responsible for producing tools that will enable library consortia and small independent publishers to negotiate transformative agreements, which is to say, agreements that will enable the publisher to fully transition to open access. The first task and finish group developed shared principles for transformative agreements. The second developed a data template to enable smaller independent publishers to reach agreements with library consortia and libraries, while the third developed example licence agreements. These groups recognized that the implementation of a transformative agreement crosses a complex ecosystem of technology, processes, policies, automated functions and manual functions that relate to contract management, article submission and peer review, content hosting and dissemination as well as financial management. For this reason, a fourth group produced a workflow framework that describes the process in all its phases. The members of these four groups were volunteers from stakeholder communities including libraries, library consortia, smaller independent publishers and intermediaries. This article explains why these tools are needed and the process behind their creation. The authors have combined these tools into a freely available toolkit, available under a CC BY licence.

AB  - SUMMARY Serials challenges, particularly the pricing of sci-tech serials have been with us for more than 20 years. These challenges continue to consume inordinate amounts of time of many persons in the academy. Are there solutions or are we destined to stay on the merry-go-round? Who are the players and what are their roles?

AB  - While more recognizable publishing models continue to be favored across academic research and publishing systems, the diverse forms of knowledge emerging from publicly-engaged projects derived from working directly with and for communities requires novel and more dynamic publishing solutions. This article considers how the appropriate application of metadata and persistent identifiers to the processes and outputs of engaged scholarship are required to support the goals of the publicly-engaged humanities, and potentially lead to faster and more effective forms of impact for the people and places involved.

It might also sound familiar to subscription agents as they grapple with the demands from either side of the journal supply chain and the sometimes contradictory messages that come from their publisher and librarian colleagues. This article reflects on this potential ambivalence, why it exists and where it might lead.

AB  - Readers have another perspective. 1For journals, their perspective initially was shaped largely by ecosystems created by scholarly publishers and libraries; for books, their perspective is shaped as much by Amazon and Google.Amazon's pervasive reading interfaces, robust cross-device syncing, seamless delivery from numerous publishers, and familiar discovery environment set high expectations for book discovery and delivery.Scholars, at least, regularly pay out of pocket to read e-books through the Kindle and similar ecosystems.In academic e-book environments, scholars and students have the fragmented experience of numerous platforms, the unavailability of many titles, discovery limitations, multiple confusing digital rights management (DRM) solutions, and poor device support.Since most academic readers have had at least some experience with both ecosystems, they have the ability to evaluate them comparatively.Even without out-of-pocket costs, the academic e-book ecosystem poses comparative barriers for readers.Reading is not the only, and indeed perhaps not the most important, use for scholarly books.Search and browse functions, enabled in print books through tables of contents, illustrations, and indices, are vital to humanists who only sometimes read a book cover to cover.Although there is some evidence that scholars and students alike have continued to prefer reading in print, these other functions are eased tremendously by using e-books and online tools (Housewright, Schonfeld, & Wulfson, 2013; see especially the discussion around Figure 14 on pages 31-32).Notably, Google Books offers an outstanding discovery experience, not only in searching for books but perhaps even more importantly in searching for phrases and ideas within books, offering a powerful supplement, if not a substitute, for the traditional index.Google Books may not be widely used as a source for reading, but for many scholars it is an outstanding complementary resource that indicates another important way in which scholars and students use e-books (Rutner & Schonfeld, 2012; see especially pages 17-19 and 44).At this early stage in the development of scholarly e-books, there is every reason to believe that expectations for discovery, reading, and perhaps other uses are being set by one major ecosystem (Kindle) and a small set of other major initiatives (especially Google Books).If this is true, there may be other approaches that libraries and content platforms should consider.For example, they might determine that it makes more sense to find ways to work as a part of Foreword | iii this consumer ecosystem, or they might create a more coherent user experience that offers an academic alternative to the consumer ecosystem.Ultimately, librarians should bear in mind that user experience does not begin and end with a single content platform.Even when the experience is strong on a single content platform, readers experience the oftenawkward transitions across platforms and challenges moving books seamlessly into reading-optimized interfaces.Libraries may find it helpful to consider these issues more systematically rather than as a part of a selection and procurement process.Indeed, these processes often show their limits in trying to manage a format transition no less fundamental than that from scroll to codex.Content platforms, too, may find that by interoperating more seamlessly and serving the reading experience more richly, they will attract more readers to digital formats.The introduction of e-books offers some very exciting opportunities for the academic community.Recognizing the place of academic e-books in relation to a broader consumer e-book ecosystem may suggest opportunities to embrace this new format more fully.notE 1.I use the term "reader" in this piece to indicate individuals whose objective is to read a book, in whatever format.Individuals who have other objectives with books, such as skimming the illustrations, consulting an index, or conducting text mining, are grouped generally as "users."Readers and users alike take many steps, and have many needs, in order to find and use one or more books.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes a national experiment in the licensing of full text information in journals, primarily in the fields of science, technology and medicine. It discusses the initiative of the federal government of Canada through the creation of the Canada Foundation for Innovation as a new funding agency, with an objective of improving research and creativity in Canadian science. The successful efforts initiated by the Canadian Association of Research Libraries/Association des bibliothèques de recherche du Canada to create a funding opportunity to develop the ‘information infrastructure’ for Canadian researchers and the resulting Canadian National Site Licensing Project (CNSLP) progress is discussed. The evolution of a project governance structure to maintain the support of the 64 participating institutions is reviewed and the need to develop an appropriate exit strategy at the conclusion of the federal funding is also considered.

AB  - The Croatian Scientific Bibliography - CROSBI is a bibliography web site that stores information about scientific papers published in Croatia in the last 15 years. At the present, CROSBI consists of over 400,000 records and is daily accessed and updated by a large number of researchers. As the appearance and purpose of database (and hence its structure) changed over the years, some inconsistencies emerged, and existing data could not be used to its fullest potential, e.g. linking papers from the same journal or conference, or analysis of scientific activity in relation to the place of article publication. This paper explores the possibilities of improving and enriching the CROSBI database, using different techniques, from data cleaning and sanity checking, to creating links between CROSBI and similar online bibliographic databases. In order to improve data quality, book records from CROSBI were linked to the corresponding Google Books records, and using Semantic Web technologies, a number of links between CROSBI and online bibliographic databases was created. The resulting data set can be used to further improve the quality of CROSBI by creating a recommender system, or to improve and open up new possibilities in the analysis of existing data.

AB  - This study aims to determine the librarian's understanding of data repository which include benefits, engagement of librarians in repository management, and repository implementation. The study has surveyed librarians at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences located in Jakarta, Bogor, Cibinong, and Serpong by distributing 45 questionnaires, but only 36 returned. The data were tabulated and analyzed using graphs/diagrams. The respondents of the study were female (61.1%) and male (38.9%). The education background of the respondents was undergraduate (50%), the most working period is between 20-30 years (38.9%), and the most work locations were in Jakarta (70.6%). The study showed that respondents with an undergraduate background and those who work in Jakarta have the highest understanding of the repository (69%). The most involved in repository management were those with bachelor's degrees and working in Jakarta (52%). Respondents who were involved in the socialization of the data repository were 47%, and those who were not involved were 44%. As many as 44% of respondents stated that the data repository has been implemented, and the remaining 56% said it has not been implemented. In conclusion, most respondents understand the data repository, especially those with a bachelor's degree, and were working in Jakarta. The data repository has not been implemented properly due to lack of outreach to researchers and their low trust in the data repository.

AB  - the researchers examined metadata provided by users of the photo-sharing website Flickr.Their goal was to see what they could learn about how users classify content, and if any of that knowledge could potentially be applied to our own systems.The researchers examined 3,000 photos from 879 individual users, 300 photoset (album) descriptions, and discussions from 200 group photo pools.Overall, the team found that Flickr users focused primarily on identifying people, places and activities in their photos.They also found many users who did not use tags at all on their photos, and instead relied on photoset descriptions to provide metadata.For those who did use tags, they were used both individually (to identify a particular friend) and collectively (to identify a public event or place, for example).This data was mapped against a previous photo sorting and identification study, and the authors provide a brief analysis.In addition, they also briefly compared Flickr's group categories and the guidelines for posting within those groups to a handful of current metadata frameworks.Continuation of the research should yield some interesting, more concrete, recommendations.[AC]

AB  - In recent years there has been a growing interest in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) coming from business and scientific communities alike.One of the elementary concepts of the proposed Industry 4.0 is the IIoT which proposes the implementation of the regular Internet of Things (IoT) concept on a much larger scale within the industrial facilities, thus interconnecting devices in industrial settings.While the main focus of the scientific community is on the cost/benefit analysis and practical application of the mentioned concept, one often overlooked aspect is its security.The following paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review for the Industrial Internet of Things security.It contains a review of the most common types of attacks committed within the Industrial Internet of Things and a consequential analysis of the weaknesses those attacks exposed.

AB  - The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL, a division of the American Library Association) has a long history of involvement in helping to shape the evolution of scholarly communications and the role of academic libraries within it. A recent milestone was the June 2019 release of the publication Open and Equitable Scholarly Communications: Creating a More Inclusive Future , with significant involvement from ACRL’s Research and Scholarly Environment Committee (ReSEC) as described in the report’s foreword. Broader in scope than past 2004 and 2007 ACRL scholarly communication research agendas, the 2019 report was more ambitious and action-oriented, and it put social justice at the center as part of ACRL’s broader core commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion.

AB  - Abstract In this editorial essay, we argue that Generative Artificial Intelligence programs (GenAI) draw on what we term a “hypercommons”, involving collectively produced inputs and labour that are largely invisible or untraceable. We argue that automatizing the exploitation of common inputs, in ways that remix and reconfigure them, can lead to a crisis of academic authorship in which the moral agency involved in scholarly production is increasingly eroded. We discuss the relationship between the hypercommons and authorship in terms of moral agency and the ethics of academic production, speculating on different responses to the crisis of authorship as posed by GenAI.

AB  - Promoting journals managed in DOAJ, it provides convenience as a curated online directory a community that indexes and provides access to managed journals to improve the journal. The data available in DOAJ are independent, and this community service is believed to guide journal managers regarding DOAJ indexing. The problem is that many scientific journals in Indonesia have yet to be indexed by DOAJ, which DOAJ provides all content free of charge without delays or user registration requirements and meets high-quality standards. This community service method uses three stages. The first stage is the preparatory stage of team coordination to determine collaboration, resource persons, and preparation of activities and events. The second stage follows up the implementation with activities in the form of lectures, discussions, questions and answers, and practice which aims to build insight into registering journals with DOAJ. The evaluation stage is carried out by giving questionnaires to seminar participants as respondents to get feedback from the organizers. The results were that 86.96% understood how to register scientific journals with DOAJ. Thus, it can be obtained an overview of the level of success in implementing community service related to participants' understanding of registering scientific journals with DOAJ.

AB  - Access to research results is imperative in today's robust digital age, yet access is often prevented by publisher paywalls.Open Access (OA) is the simple idea that all research should be free for all to access, use, and build upon.This paper will focus on three critical areas of the OA landscape: its impact on scholarship and the public, the obstacles to be overcome, and its advancements.The impact of OA actions and initiatives has been difficult to quantify, but the growing number of studies on OA have shown mostly overwhelmingly positive results.Cultural norms within academia, such as the reliance on the journal Impact Factor (IF) to assess the quality of individual research articles, have impeded the progress of OA.Conversely, federal mandates and institutional policies have supported the OA movement by requiring that scholarly publications be deposited into institutional or subject repositories immediately following publication.As information professionals, library and information science (LIS) professionals have a responsibility as practitioners, authors, and editors to support OA and encourage other academics to do the same.

AB  - What will emerge as the dominant design(s) of the "information package" of the future? How do we resolve major obstacles to the creation and utilization of electronic documents? What concepts, terms, and design principles need to be defined to discuss these questions meaningfully and to start answering them? What do these new concepts, terms and design principles mean in editorial and publishing practice? Drawing on the experience of developing: Living Reviews in Relativity, an innovative online journal for physics, the paper discusses these latter questions. The paper highlights some of the information needs which Living Reviews fills and explains how the principles guiding its design attempt to meet those needs. These design principles are "synergy", "adaptability", and "utilizability" of information. In addition, the paper discusses a basic assumption that, rather than having readers, Living Reviews has users for whom we are providing a research tool. Combining that perspective with the fact that we are offering (literature/research) review articles, and with the fact that we are working in an electronic environment which allows multiple forms of indexing and presentation, we have decided to treat our reference information as highly significant. The paper discusses how we treat this information as significant, and the impact we expect this treatment to have.

AB  - Digital technology has a great influence on scientific communication and scientific research in general.As a result, science has become more highly collaborative, network-based, and data-intensive seeking for different kinds of support for research as well for other activities that follow research such as rapid publication of research results and dissemination and preservation of research data.Having these issues in mind, the traditional system of scientific communication has also begun search for a new publishing and communication platform.At the beginning of the 1990s digital repositories appeared as a possible solution offering several key advantages over the existing publishing and preservation solutions.At the moment digital repositories of scientific information are closest to the position of new mainstream publishing and communication platform in science as they have become more mature and developed networked information systems; as their number in the world is on the rise and as they have become more and more accepted by the scientific community.While first digital repositories were isolated systems, today they distributed federated and highly integrated applications and services.In combination with the open access initiative, digital repositories of scientific information started to offer many benefits for different groups of users.Furthermore, digital repositories could help smaller countries to become more visible in the global scientific community by offering online open access digital peer reviewed scientific content.Digital repositories should solve problems inherited from the existing paper based system of scientific communication: access to scientific information for different categories of users, storage space, slow publishing, quality and quantity of scientific knowledge, organization of scientific knowledge in transparent way, interoperability of information systems and many other issues scientific publishers, universities and their libraries haven't solved so far.This paper offers an overview of the important characteristics that make digital repositories so important in modern science.

AB  - Abstract Citations are crucial artifacts to provide additional information to the reader to comprehend the research under concern. There are different roles that citations play in scientific discourse. Correctly identifying the intent of the citations finds applications ranging from predicting scholarly impact, finding idea propagation, to text summarization. With the rapid growth in scientific literature, the need for automated methods to classify citations is now growing intense. However, we can only fully understand the intent of a citation if we look at the citation context in the citing paper and also the primary purpose of the cited article. In this work, we propose a neural multi-task learning framework that harnesses the structural information of the research papers and the cited paper’s information for the effective classification of citation intents. We analyze the impact of three auxiliary tasks on the performance of our approach for citation classification. Our experiments on three benchmark citation classification datasets show that incorporating cited paper information (title) shows that our deep neural model achieves a new state-of-the-art on the ACL-ARC dataset with an absolute increase of 5.3% in the F1 score over the previous best model. We also achieve comparable performance with respect to the best-performing systems in the SDP 2021 3C Shared task on Citation Context Classification. We make our codes available at https://github.com/Tirthankar-Ghosal/citationclassification-SCIM

AB  - <p indent=0mm>Focusing on the expression, conception, creative means and presentation characteristics of scientific articles, this paper carries out the exploration and research on the development trends of scientific articles driven by technology. (1) The expression of scientific articles: Towards atomization. With the development of reading style, discipline development, academic communications and emerging technology, the phenomenon of fragmentation in the process of scientific research and publishing has become increasingly prominent, which forces the author’s writing style and article form to change. The future article is likely to be atomized articles with propositions and insights, which can be ideas, data and observations, or opinions. The content tends to be short and concise; in reading, it is more in line with the needs of human fragmented knowledge acquisition, but also conducive to machine identification, discovery, sharing and replication; and more diversified in presentation. (2) The conception of scientific articles: Providing better insights. AI constantly adapts to the more and more complex environment, improves the generalization ability of AI, and efficiently obtains hidden causality from structured data, which is not affected by physiological and psychological state, provides reliable and error-free analysis ability, and innovates the analysis method and efficiency of data. At the same time, AI has more powerful storage capacity and faster computing power, runs stably, helps researchers to improve the processing and analysis of data, provides researchers with more profound insights and support, and at the same time makes opinions more predictable and standardized, and enhances human decision-making ability. (3) The creation of scientific articles: The coexistence of UGC/PGC/OGC/MGC mode. MGC creation is the direction of intellectual media, and it will also be the mainstream form of articles creation in the future. With the help of machine intelligence, researchers can produce professional content more efficiently and realize the evolution road of intelligence specialization and intelligence of all things. Of course, the development of the Internet era is not a new model rapidly replacing another model, this change is usually relatively gradual, sudden far-reaching and fundamental changes are even less, so the future scientific articles creation is still the era of the coexistence of UGC/PGC/OGC/MGC mode. (4) The presentation of scientific articles: Giving readers the greatest freedom to read. In terms of the development of the whole society, interactivity is an important direction of today’s technological development, and “Taobao waiter” is the best illustration. For interactive articles, readers can change the underlying code and generate modified charts in order to better understand, verify or reconstruct the relevant work, and give readers more freedom to read; MR/VR/AR gives readers a more three-dimensional reading experience; articles have increasingly become web content, and hyperlinks have become a new way of literature citation. We can not only link the literature, but also link the comments of the “cited” references, and judge the starting point, breadth and depth of the articles according to the authority of the linked commentators. The innovative expression of scientific articles brings changes to the form of scientific research, academic innovation and discipline ecology, which makes full communication and interaction among researchers; the deep integration of emerging technologies and scientific journals will have a great impact on the development of science.

AB  - I would like to welcome Dr Clifford Lynch: if you were here four years ago you will know he gave our opening address on that occasion: a brilliant speech. Clifford is a man of many interests in his own right and a member of many influential committees on technical questions, standards, library matters and data base issues and he is one of the few people who can see how all these phenomena link together. He can synthesise and can make some sense of it for the rest of us. Presently he is the director of Library Automation at the University of California, Office of the President, where he is responsible for the Melvyl system, which he told me yesterday is now around sixteen years old. It is one of the largest public access information retrieval systems in existence. Clifford also manages the network that links the nine University of California campuses to each other and to the broader Internet. He has been at the University of California since 1979. He received his PhD in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley: he is active in the development of standards and is the leader of the Coalition for Network Informations Architecture and Standards Working Group. He has served as director of, and is currently immediate past-president of the American Society for Information Science. When we contacted Clifford to see if he would be willing to come and speak he e-mailed back immediately saying ‘I would be delighted to do this if I can fit it into my schedule.’ Several weeks went by arranging other people to fit in with various meetings, and in the end Clifford had to commute to give this address; he arrived yesterday and he is leaving tomorrow! I have much pleasure in inviting our first keynote speaker, Dr Clifford Lynch to address us.

AB  - Abstract In this paper, we use computer techniques to extract the features of each convolutional layer of CNN, analyze the feature variations of different depth convolutions, and propose a new network framework to improve the head pose estimation task performance by combining the task characteristics of head pose estimation. Multi-scale feature information fusion is the basis of the proposed head pose estimation method (IRHP-Net), which consists of a feature extraction module and a multi-scale feature information fusion module. In the smart classroom learning environment, the algorithm is used to identify students’ attention areas and construct the distraction index and threshold parameters to determine the inattentive state and provide relevant teaching measures. Smart classroom teaching resulted in a 39.69% increase in students’ attention, as shown in the results. Students in the traditional teaching mode showed a 16.7% lower level of learning engagement. A 17.24% increase in academic performance was also a result of the increase in attention and learning engagement.

AB  - The current generation of web annotation technologies use a set of keying techniques, often based on the Document Object Model (DOM) for representing HTML content, that link an annotation to its target content. However, when the DOM structure changes, for any reason, or browser rendering engines parse the underlying source differently, annotations can be orphaned and incorrectly re-attached. This article explores the preservation strategies that are required to ensure the longevity of scholarly annotations that use such technologies. These recommendations range from the social changes needed for the perception of annotations as first-class scholarly objects through to the technological changes and infrastructures that are needed for the preservation of such objects. It concludes with a series of recommendations for changes in practice and infrastructure that work towards the digital preservation of DOM-node-keyed scholarly web annotations.

AB  - Prior studies show gaps in using the Zoom application for language learning with various perceptions of language learning. This study attempts to reveal students' perceptions of using the Zoom Cloud Meeting Application in teaching and learning reading classes at one of the universities in Malang. Therefore, the descriptive qualitative approach was adopted for this study. The researcher collected data using a questionnaire adapted prior study (Suadi, 2021). The findings of this study suggest that the virtual reading lesson offered via the Zoom application to students majoring in communication science at one of the universities in Malang was highly welcomed by students. Aside from that, pupils thought the Zoom application might help them improve their reading skills and overcome their shyness in virtual classroom interactions. This finding further illuminates the discrepancies in students' perceptions, which may serve as consideration for using the Zoom application in teaching and learning reading.

AB  - Text analytics can be applied in education to gain insights into student learning, teacher performance, and educational trends by analysing various forms of text-based data such as student essays, social media posts, and educational resources. While the need for teacher preparation and training is identified, specific solutions or effective strategies for equipping educators with the skills and knowledge to integrate graphic visualizations into their teaching practices might be underexplored. This Scientometrics study used PRISMA approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) Using R tool. Scopus databases that were relevant to the research topic, and its standardized procedures ensured comprehensiveness and replicability. The study found 85 articles using the PRISMA approach from the Scopus database, with 98.82% being articles and 1.18% from conference proceedings. The number of articles published increased in 2022, with 33 articles, compared to 22 articles in 2020. The total number of cited papers was 70, with a total citation of 969. This indicates an increase in research related to graphic visualization in education due to technological advancements. The citation per cited paper was 119. Besides, the study identifies the top 10 countries that have conducted research in graphic visualization, with the United States leading with 19 studies followed by China with 12 and Spain with 8. The top three subject areas in the current research trends are Computer Science education with 78 publications, Engineering education with 33, and Social Science education with 14. Other fields related to language and linguistics are also being given special attention. These findings suggest that education systems and research in education are keeping up with global developments. There is potential for visualizations to be integrated with AI technologies to provide personalized learning experiences, while ensuring that visualizations are accessible to all students, including those with visual impairments. Studies have shown that using these approaches in education can enhance student learning and understanding of complex concepts.

AB  - Document understanding and information extraction include different tasks to understand a document and extract valuable information automatically. Recently, there has been a rising demand for developing document understanding among different domains, including business, law, and medicine, to boost the efficiency of work that is associated with a large number of documents. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and industry developers in the field of document intelligence and understanding diverse document types to boost automatic document processing and understanding techniques. We also release a data challenge on the recently introduced document-level VQA dataset, PDFVQA. The PDFVQA challenge examines the model's structural and contextual understandings on the natural full document level of multiple consecutive document pages by including questions with a sequence of answers extracted from multi-pages of the full document. This task helps to boost the document understanding step from the single-page level to the full document level understanding.

AB  - As publishers and vendors offer more electronic resources, the number of licenses that have to be negotiated and executed increase proportionally. Libraries and publishers often have conflicting goals, making the successful outcome of a license negotiation difficult to obtain. A small group of licensing professionals gathered for a frank, open discussion of the terms and conditions that are important to each side, thereby opening the channels of communication on a larger scale. The discussion panel consisted of three academic librarians and two publisher representatives; the moderator is an academic librarian and a member of the Shared Electronic Resource Understanding (SERU) Working Group, as is one of the panelists. The goal of the session was for each side to come away with a greater understanding of the other's positions on key license points, as well as some strategies for arriving at compromises. The mission of SERU was discussed and promoted, creating more awareness on both sides of the table of the existence and usefulness of SERU as an alternative to the cumbersome license negotiation process.

AB  - For three and a half years, Mr. Weber's firm has been facilitating two-day, highly interactive public workshops on Mapping the Future of Publishing and the information industries. In the past year or so, several new issues and themes have emerged that concern both publishers and users of information, including the personalization of information through modularization or "chunking," and the use of encryption-based metering technology to control and charge for information access and use. Publishers also face critical strategic business issues in migrating from print to electronic publications. This paper explains the workshop process and what participants think about these important issues.

AB  - To meet the research, teaching, and learning needs of their users, academic librarians, particularly those functioning as subject liaisons, are expected to know the institution’s curriculum and research areas so that they can help shape library strategies to meet those needs and to connect users to the library’s resources and services. The present study investigated the use of Refinitiv’s free web demo, Open Calais, as a text mining tool to help learn about the research areas in the University of Tennessee’s Tickle College of Engineering. We investigated the following research questions: What interdisciplinary research areas in the College does Open Calais reveal? What are the differences in Open Calais’ tagging of Scopus and web pages? What terms were uncovered by Open Calais that were unexpected by the subject librarian? The results showed a mixed picture of the usefulness of Open Calais for learning the research areas of the College of Engineering.

AB  - We present our work to develop digital objects to represent and convey a specific category of scientific knowledge: computable biomedical knowledge (CBK). Properly developed, validated, implemented and stewarded, CBK has the potential to accelerate the translation of actionable knowledge from scientific discovery to clinical application. Our research takes an infrastructural approach to CBK, initially by focusing on the creation of a conceptual model for packaging computable biomedical knowledge - the Knowledge Object (KO) - and on corresponding efforts to create an architecture for KO management and implementation. Additionally, our work is grounded in the FAIR principles, such that KO artefacts should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and we are exploring aligning KOs with emerging best practices for FAIR Digital Objects (FDO). The outcomes of this work resonate in clinical contexts, health professions education, healthcare quality improvement, biomedical and translational research and population care. Our KO model is also of interest to researchers and practitioners interested in knowledge science, including those working with semantic technologies and other forms of digital objects.

AB  - The Publisher Application System (PAS) is a Web-based archiving and online evaluation system developed by the Database Evaluation Group (DEG), one of the working groups formed within the Anatolian University Libraries Consortium (ANKOS). The DEG was formed in 2008 to inquire and evaluate e-resources suited to the needs of the consortium; to follow up similar consortial activities worldwide as well as developments in connection with the scientific publishing industry; and to determine, implement, and improve pricing models in accordance with the prevailing economic, legal, and academic system. Development of the PAS was essential to ensure standardization and sustainability towards a more detailed and effective analysis of e-resources qualifying for evaluation by ANKOS. The PAS played an important part not only in establishing and defining the workflow of the DEG, but also in creating an archive of both the e-resources submitted to the consortium and the applicant publishers/agents submitting these resources. This article outlines the process that started with the foundation of the DEG through the formation of the PAS as well as the present setup of the system. It is also hoped that this case study will have a positive contribution to the processes being followed by the persons and the groups engaged in similar activities.

AB  - Over time, publishing technologies have not only influenced how people read, but also how knowledge is evaluated and authority is established.Social and mobile technologies represent relatively recent developments that have transformed the trade publishing world, but the extent to which they have affected academic publishing remains an open question.This article examines the rapid and disruptive transformations in the trade and digital publishing world, discusses how these developments have already intersected with the work of academics and considers how these changes might continue to transform the dissemination of academic research in the future.

AB  - One of the alternatives to revive the religious manuscript researcher and scholar passion is by providing an easy online reference about religious manuscript. Some manuscript researcher of ex-Office of Religious Research and Development Ministry of Religious Affairs have started to make and maintain an online repository about religious manuscripts since 2019. The plentiful manuscript data, which is resulted from research, contain philological description aspect and digital photo file needs to be followed up more than just a research report or catalogue. It also needs to be easily accessible by other scholar and researcher in an open access repository. This online repository, managed by the researcher team, contain almost 450 religious manuscripts from Madura. The other data that will be uploaded are Islamic manuscript found in Bali, manuscript by K.H. Ahmad Rifa’i Kalisalak, Syaikh Mahfudz Termas, and also from K.H. Hasyim Asy’ari. Using descriptive qualitative method, this paper aims to answer and introduce to three aspects, namely: a) the importance of providing an open access of religious manuscript using online repository; b) the content and general description of religious manuscript online repository; and c) the guidelines on how to access and download the manuscript from online repository.

AB  - The economic challengers in higher education and healthcare coupled with continuing budget concerns have libraries, publishers and vendors making strategic changes as they seek to provide a high-level of services at a time when uncertainty continues to dominate planning and development. Creative thinking has become the norm as organizations seek to challenge long-held views and uncover and implement needed changes. Librarians, publishers, and vendors have all experienced a period of assessment, strategic review and reaction as a result of the continued evolution from a print-based model to one dominated by electronic dissemination of scholarly information and the new role eBooks promise to play. This presentation addresses some of the important actions taken by librarians, publishers and vendors to cope with changes forced by both the economy and budget pressures, by the continued migration of scholarly resources to electronic formats and by current and planned eBook activities and new eBooks models. It explores patterns in library content selection and spending trends, publisher prices and pricing models, as well as vendor strategies and tactics challenging and changing times. Data to be presented is the result of customer research conducted by EBSCO within the last six months.

AB  - The shift in scholarly communication from print to electronic format—and from ownership to access-based delivery models—has changed the dynamics of control related to library collections (Breeding 2019; Singley 2020). External providers now deliver most scholarly content to users, reducing library control to primarily print collections. User data gained through tracking technology, which often collects information without a user’s knowledge or agency, is a product of this shift that has been identified by previous studies (Hinchliffe, Zimmerman, and Altman 2018; Hanson 2019). This tracking data, aggregated by third parties who use it to form user profiles that can then be commodified, “challenges libraries’ historical assumptions about privacy and anonymity” (Hanson 2019, under “Aggregated Identities”).

AB  - The post-print era was peculiar for a dramatic shift in the study of the humanities.Concomitant with this insurgency called digitization was the inscription of ideology on the minds of its subjects which succeeded in disconcerting many of those who spoke confidently for a digital revolution in the academic context.The debate whether digitized knowledge should be scrutinized in a competitive or a cooperative light has brought with it a certain indeterminacy of definition which allows it to figure in a varied span of concerns: self and other, past and present, sign and concept, etc.My argument is that the category of the digital assumes the polysemy it does in our modern world because, in speaking of the humanities, it speaks also of power relations which are at the heart of the struggle for cultural hegemony.Ultimately, in its cooperative or competitive underpinnings, the subjectivity of the user is the epistemic source most actively engaged in producing and extracting meaning in a digital context.

AB  - This article is devoted to the philosophy of science in Russia from the end of the 19 th century to&nbsp;the beginning of the 1920s. In that period, the Philosophical Society was one of the philosophy&nbsp;centers in the country. An important characteristic of the society was its interdisciplinarity. This&nbsp;affected both the list of its members and the topics of the papers presented at its meetings. From&nbsp;the very beginning, the society consisted of representatives of various fields of science, including&nbsp;botanists, physicists, mathematicians, lawyers, psychologists, historians, and philosophers. This&nbsp;enabled a comprehensive review of individual philosophical problems and ideas. With the principle of interdisciplinarity at its root, the Philosophical Society became a platform for fruitful debates over important problems from various disciplines, including philosophy of science. Some of&nbsp;them are summarized in this article.

AB  - Federal funding agencies in the United States (U.S.) continue to work towards implementing their plans to increase public access to funded research and comply with the 2013 Office of Science and Technology memo Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research. In this article we report on an analysis of research data sharing policy documents from 17 U.S. federal funding agencies as of February 2021. Our analysis is guided by two questions: 1.) What do the findings suggest about the current state of and trends in U.S. federal funding agency data sharing requirements? 2.) In what ways are universities, institutions, associations, and researchers affected by and responding to these policies? Over the past five years, policy updates were common among these agencies and several themes have been thoroughly developed in that time; however, uncertainty remains around how funded researchers are expected to satisfy these policy requirements.

AB  - Introduction: Campus affordability initiatives promote the adoption of free, low-cost, and open educational materials. Coordinators first need to understand faculty usage of instructional course materials, textbook selection authority, and their price tolerance for, knowledge of, and use of open educational resources (OER). Methods: Faculty at a medium-sized research university in the Midwest were invited to participate in an online survey about their current use of instructional course materials, their knowledge of material cost, and student purchasing habits. The survey had a completion rate of 128 responses, representing all teaching ranks on campus. Results: Instructors assign a wide range of materials and rarely hear from students about their inability to purchase textbooks. The majority find US$100 or more an acceptable price and believe that more than 70% of students purchase all required items. Over half of respondents make the final decision about their materials, and factually accurate content is the top priority when making selections. Eighty percent have some awareness of OER, but OER use is low. Discussion: Response rate was too low to make general assumptions but suggests areas for further exploration and provides base data when working with departments. A faculty member’s selection authority could be limiting OER use and impacting students. Discussions need to take place about an acceptable price for department courses and how faculty decide to require materials. Conclusion: Outreach to campus partners should promote high-quality materials as instructors consider this the most when selecting resources. Further examination of how selection authority impacts OER use and student success need to occur.

AB  - This Report from the Field introduces a collaboratively authored set of documentation that compares digital publishing platforms that are typically used by library publishers. This report discusses how we created this set of crosswalks that compare 10 publishing platforms, most of which are academy-owned and open-source. These platforms are used to create eBooks, digital humanities projects, journals, collections, and community projects, and the crosswalks compare a set of common features each has, including hosting options and cost, ingestion options, interactivity, archive and preservation features, export options, accessibility, and other features. We walk readers through how to use this Creative-Commons-licensed tool to compare platforms, features, and project types, with the hopes that users (be they librarians or authors) can easily compare and make decisions about which platform might best suit their publishing needs.

AB  - A few commercial publishers dominate provision of access to scientific and technical information sought after by researchers around the world.Increasing subscription prices of journals at rates higher than general inflation caused librarians to think of forming consortia, but publishers started selling online journals as bundles, and libraries ended up with many journals their researchers have very little use for.Scientists and librarians adopted open access, but publishers came up with hybrid journals and article processing charges to beat any adverse effect on their profits caused by the fast-spreading open access movement.We compare the steps taken by scientists and librarians in the West to reclaim ease of access to research findings with what is happening in India.We end with a few suggestions.

AB  - To this date, the efficacy of the scientific publishing enterprise fundamentally rests on the strength of the peer review process. The journal editor or the conference chair primarily relies on the expert reviewers’ assessment, identify points of agreement and disagreement and try to reach a consensus to make a fair and informed decision on whether to accept or reject a paper. However, with the escalating number of submissions requiring review, especially in top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences, the editor/chair, among many other works, invests a significant, sometimes stressful effort to mitigate reviewer disagreements. Here in this work, we introduce a novel task of automatically identifying contradictions among reviewers on a given article. To this end, we introduce ContraSciView, a comprehensive review-pair contradiction dataset on around 8.5k papers (with around 28k review pairs containing nearly 50k review pair comments) from the open review-based ICLR and NeurIPS conferences. We further propose a baseline model that detects contradictory statements from the review pairs. To the best of our knowledge, we make the first attempt to identify disagreements among peer reviewers automatically. We make our dataset and code public for further investigations.

AB  - Essay writing has always been an important skill for students. However, this skill could be more comfortable for them. Therefore, an effective technique is needed to help students to cope with the problem. Project-based learning (PjBL)is one of the learning models which can make learners interested and motivated in writing. The study employs expose-facto with mixed data types. This research investigated 23 English students’ activities, results, and their responses in essay writing using a PjBL model. We employed three instruments; observation, questionnaire, and test. Qualitative descriptive techniques analyzed the data. The results showed that (1) the implementation of the project-based learning model was classified as good and successful. It can be seen from the student's learning outcomes and the successful implementation of the steps that have been determined. (2) The students’ responses to the project-based learning model have been classified as positive since the students explained effective ways of learning essay writing. The students’ learning outcomes show better achievements in learning essay writing. Thus, learning essay writing can be concluded. It implies that implementing the PjBL model in ELT students yields good vibes in students’ learning activities.

AB  - in 2020 by the Modern Language Association after almost a decade of work.DPiH is a large-scale scholarly project that presents the stuff of teaching (syllabi, assignments, and resources) through a curated set of keywords such as "Poetry," "Disability," "Queer," and "Annotation," among many others. 1For each keyword, a curator or set of curators has selected and annotated ten pedagogical artifacts; created a curator's selection statement; and presented a list of related resources.With a lengthy introduction to DPiH that historicizes and contextualizes the project, the edited collection, as a whole, presents a broad array of pedagogical practices that engage technology and offer concrete resources to faculty who would like to expand their existing teaching practices.In this piece, we would like to consider how the project, in its design and implementation, challenges existing ideas about scholarship, pedagogy, and our shared ecosystem of scholarly communication.

AB  - Barriers to the implementation of open access globally need to be studied further using a systematic review. The purpose of this study is to look at the barriers from various countries in implementing open access. This study uses a systematic review method with a qualitative approach. The data collection method is in the form of planning, implementation, and synthesis of search results. This study uses Google Scholar to capture all research on implementing scientific communication with open access in the global realm. The search results on Google Scholar using Boolean logic found 273 articles. After the elimination process based on research objectives became 16 articles. This study shows that the biggest obstacle in implementing open access is the perception of the researchers (33.3%) which indicates that the quality of open access journals is less guaranteed, that is, many of them fall into the category of predatory journals. In addition, another obstacle identified was policy (25.6%). The government or stakeholders must make policies that regulate the standards for the quality of open access journals, the editorial board, and the time intervals for publishing journals. Other obstacles include financial factors where many researchers have minimal research funds but open access publications require large funds (23.1%), followed by copyright (10.3%) and language (7.7%) because not all researchers are fluent in English. The results of this study can be used as a reference for further research in assessing the obstacles that have also been happened in Indonesia.

AB  - Abstract The Metadata 2020 initiative is an ongoing effort to bring various scholarly communications stakeholder groups together to promote principles and standards of practice to improve the quality of metadata. To understand the perspectives and practices regarding metadata of the main stakeholder groups (librarians, publishers, researchers, and repository managers), we conducted a survey during summer 2019. The survey content was generated by representatives from the stakeholder groups. A link to an online survey (17 or 18 questions depending on the group) was distributed through multiple social media, listserv, and blog outlets. Responses were anonymous, with an optional entry for names and email addresses for those who were willing to be contacted later. Complete responses (N = 211; 87 librarians, 27 publishers, 48 repository managers, and 49 researchers) representing 23 countries on four continents were analyzed and summarized for thematic content and ranking of awareness and practices. Across the stakeholder groups, the level of awareness and usage of metadata methods and practices was highly variable. Clear gaps across the groups point to the need for consolidation of schema and practices, as well as broad educational efforts to increase knowledge and implementation of metadata in scholarly communications.

AB  - Education for Instruction Librarians has traditionally centered upon the acquisition of practical classroom skills.While this approach has merit, from a sociocultural perspective of learning, student development emerges more completely through engagement with the communal activities and values that constitute professional practices rather than through the achievement of individual competencies.Drawing upon these understandings, this paper reports on the experiences of an Open Access writing assignment that was librarian-reviewed.The assignment was designed to build student participation within Instruction Librarian practices and communities.Focused upon the 19 student and 19 librarian-reviewer experiences (38 total) of the assignment, the survey-based methodology that is used in this study reveals a lack of communication between student and practitioner Instruction Librarians as well as the importance of the assignment to both student and librarian learning.These findings demonstrate that developing student access to professional practices and communities can be beneficial for students as well as for Instruction Librarians.

AB  - Over the past decade, the technical marketing term "cloud computing" has led users and organizations to enter into contractual agreements that sometimes result in the inappropriate use of content without their knowledge and additional risk for breaches of privacy. These agreements also can end up "vendor locking" organizations into services that take on a subscription model as opposed to true data ownership from self-hosting. While this shift occurred, processors evolved at a pace that allowed the adoption of smartphones which now equal pocket computers. Many smartphones run on the ARM based processor platform, that facilitates powerful processing and relatively low power consumption. With the arrival of the successful ARM processor based, educational microcomputer called the "Raspberry Pi", a whole new market of credit card sized microcomputers has started to flourish. These microcomputers have the capability of running web server applications that can be used in libraries of all sizes. This potential "desktop datacenter" advancement is profound for small libraries like those found in churches and seminaries around the world. With low power consumption, these single board servers give the capability to service areas that have never had the opportunity to host application servers due to unstable electricity. This paper illustrates the use of the single board computing platform named "BeagleBone Black" running Ubuntu Linux, to host the institutional repository application Omeka. This work guides a small library to build an IR site, supporting Dublin Core metadata with Omeka, for under a $200 while assuring complete content ownership.

AB  - Estuda o uso e a visibilidade dos repositórios institucionais, em especial o da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). Busca verificar a experiência e a percepção do usuário no que concerne aos repositórios digitais em face ao suprimento das suas necessidades informacionais. Tem como objetivo geral analisar o uso e a visibilidade do Repositório Institucional da UFRN. Visa especificamente analisar se os discentes conhecem os repositórios da instituição de ensino em que fazem parte, bem como identificar quais os repositórios digitais que esses discentes acessam e qual a frequência de uso. Utiliza como metodologia a pesquisa bibliográfica em fontes impressas e eletrônicas; pesquisa descritiva com abordagens quantitativas e qualitativas resultantes da aplicação de 200 questionários no período de janeiro a maio de 2015 e 33 em maio de 2016, cujas questões objetivas e discursivas contemplam os objetivos deste trabalho. Conclui inferindo que a visibilidade dos repositórios institucionais da instituição supracitada ainda é baixa e que não há o conhecimento necessário por parte dos discentes no que concerne ao uso dessas ferramentas. Conclui-se que ainda permanece o baixo índice de uso e preferência da comunidade acadêmica em relação aos repositórios institucionais da universidade como fonte de informação para a busca e recuperação das produções científicas.

AB  - The necessity of an explicit author identification is discussed, and the already existing attempts in variuos disciplines, on national and international levels as well as commercial ideas are presented and commented. It can be shown that the developments in the field of authority records on the basis of VIAF and ISNY indicate the right direction. The necessary merge of existing author identity elements into to a new system with higher priority could be importantly.

AB  - Doctoral students require scientific writing skills and appropriate learning media assistance to meet publication requirements in distinguished journals. This investigation evaluates the efficacy of Moodle and OJS in teaching dissertation proposals, based on the experiences of engineering doctoral students, to provide suggestions for the optimal platform. The study examining the efficacy of the OJS-based learning model for developing dissertation proposals as compared to Moodle for engineering doctoral students revealed varying results based on the statistical methodology used by UEQ. While the Comparison of Scale Means indicated OJS to be superior across all scales, the Two-Sample T-Test established significant differences solely on a few scales. While the OJS learning model may have a higher mean value, its superiority across all aspects of UEQ cannot be assumed. To enhance student learning experience, outcomes, and the learning model itself, optimization of all UEQ scales is imperative in the OJS-based approach to dissertation proposal development

AB  - The authors analyze the issues that the Michigan Molecular Institute Library (MMI) will face in the transition from print to digital serials. The library supports a specialized research institute with sixty-eight serial subscriptions from forty-two publishers. Its specialized nature limits the number of potential consortia partners. Strengths include a user community of skilled researchers in a well-defined research area. In this transition, MMI will encounter both similar and different issues than those found in larger academic and research libraries. Topics include current access, planning, licensing, archival concerns, interlibrary loan (ILL), interoperability, and emerging trends. The authors recommend that the MMI librarian periodically evaluate the collection strategy in keeping with changing trends.

AB  - Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo apresentar os principais desafios enfrentados pelos bibliotecários do Instituto Federal de Educação do Maranhão (IFMA) para fomentar a implantação do repositório institucional. O referido estudo fundamenta-se em abordagens que favoreceram o desenvolvimento das iniciativas de democratização da comunicação científica por meio do acesso aberto no Brasil, em torno da implementação de ferramentas tecnológicas de divulgação científica, caso dos repositórios institucionais. A pesquisa caracteriza-se como mista, do tipo descritiva e exploratória e se deu a partir da aplicação de um questionário online, construído baseado em estudos já realizados que tiveram objetivos semelhantes em relação à implantação dos repositórios institucionais em instituições da mesma rede. O questionário foi enviado por e-mail para as 23 bibliotecas ativas do IFMA em funcionamento, dos quais 12 foram respondidos. Os dados foram analisados de forma quantitativa e qualitativa, evidenciando as principais dificuldades que desfavorecem até então a implementação do repositório institucional. Concluiu-se, que apesar das iniciativas realizadas pelos bibliotecários para iniciar o processo de implementação do repositório, algumas questões foram evidenciadas e caracterizadas como relevantes entraves nesse processo de implementação, tais como: pouco conhecimento técnico sobre os processos de implementação do repositório; ausência em priorizar o desenvolvimento das ações de implementação do repositório somada à falta de políticas institucionais para depósito compulsório da produção acadêmica, bem como a baixa interação dos bibliotecários com a equipe de Tecnologia da Informação, configurando-se como principais dificuldades para o pleno desenvolvimento do processo de implantação do repositório institucional.

AB  - Shadow libraries (SLs), such as Sci-Hub, Z-Library, and Library Genesis (LibGen), are online databases that provide content that is otherwise difficult to access (due to paywalls or other copyright controls) using unofficial methods of questionable legality. Interest in the SL phenomenon has focused on copyright infringement that occurs when a database provides library materials, for which access rights need to be purchased, without the knowledge of a given copyright owner. This study analyzes the use of SLs at the Universitas Indonesia (UI). The research uses a quantitative approach, with a survey distributed to 262 undergraduate students at UI. The frequency of SL use in academic activities of UI students is compared with the use of the UI Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC UI). The results show that most UI students have not used SLs. However, those who have used SLs report more positive impressions and higher levels of satisfaction compared with OPAC UI.

AB  - Introduction: This study investigates whether United States university libraries’ commitment to increasing open access (OA) to scholarly outputs as demonstrated by their support of campus level OA policies translates into adoption of OA policies that apply specifically to library employees. Method: This mixed-methods study used an anonymous survey and optional open-ended interviews of schol arly communications librarians at Carnegie Classification Doctoral Universities (Very High Research [R1] and High Research [R2]) to gather information about OA policies or statements at their institutions and/or within their libraries. Results &amp;amp; Discussion: Variation in campus culture and governance structure meant the path from creation to adoption to implementation of a campus and/or library OA policy was similarly varied. The research reveals librarians’ motivations for and contributions to advancement of OA on their campuses, and sometimes also within their libraries. Conclusion: Many of the rationales driving adoption of campus OA policies similarly drive adoption of library-specific OA policies. Those surveyed whose institutions did have library-based OA policies referenced both the importance of leading by example and alignment with institutional mission and values.

AB  - Depuis les premières revues en version électronique (début des années 1990) et l’utilisation par les chercheurs des réservoirs d’archives ouvertes comme mode de diffusion de leurs travaux de recherche (fin 1990), l’évolution de l’édition de revues vers un mode numérique, ouvert, est en marche et gagne tous les secteurs scientifiques, suscitant l’intérêt des chercheurs. Les revues de recherche d’architecture, d’urbanisme et de paysage n’échappent pas à cette mutation numérique et aux changements qu’elle induit, encouragée par les institutions et financeurs. Certaines revues se sont déjà transformées et le mouvement semble irréversible, mais des réticences subsistent. Après avoir présenté un état de l’art des ressources disponibles en ligne et le rôle actif des bibliothèques pour promouvoir ce format de diffusion scientifique, cet article dresse un bilan sur les conditions de mise en place de l’accès ouvert au sein des disciplines concernées : l’importance d’une politique de soutien et de la prise en compte des enjeux économiques, la pérennité des personnels œuvrant à leur rédaction et des infrastructures de diffusion, l’assurance d’un processus fiable de qualité face à la multiplication des preprints versus les exigences des organismes de financement et les freins du modèle actuel de l’évaluation des chercheurs. Diversifier les modèles de diffusion en accès ouvert de revues d’architecture, d’urbanisme et paysage pourrait créer une nouvelle dynamique, à l’exemple des pépinières, des portails de revues régionaux ou des plateformes de preprints, pour le bénéfice d’un accès durable et équitable à la recherche architecturale.

AB  - RESUMO O aumento exponencial de dados publicados na Web e a diversidade de sistemas requerem adoção de boas práticas para alcançarem índices de qualidade que possibilitem a descoberta, o acesso e o reúso. Para identificar as boas práticas, utilizou-se a revisão integrativa, assim como procedimentos da metodologia ProKnow-C. Após a aplicação dos procedimentos do ProKnow-C aos documentos recuperados nas bases de dados Web of Science, Scopus e Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts, foi realizada a análise de 31 itens. Essa análise permitiu observar que, nos últimos 20 anos, as diretrizes para publicação de dados governamentais abertos tiveram grande impacto na implementação do modelo Linked Data em diversos domínios e, atualmente, os princípios FAIR e as Data on the Web Best Practices são as mais destacadas na literatura. Essas diretrizes apresentam orientações em relação a vários aspectos para publicação de dados, de forma a contribuir para a otimização da qualidade, independente do contexto em que são aplicadas. Já os princípios CARE e FACT, que embora não tenham sido formulados com o mesmo objetivo do FAIR e das Best Practices, representam grandes desafios para os cientistas da informação e da tecnologia no que se refere a ética, responsabilidade, confidencialidade, imparcialidade, segurança e transparência dos dados.

AB  - This paper explores the challenges currently faced by music cataloguers, with particular regard to their training and the systems they work with. It asks whether music catalogers feel they have enough support and training to do their work; it investigates the skills they require, and how they might be taught. It also examines whether systems need to be adapted to suit printed music. The project focuses on staff responsible for cataloging printed music at music libraries in the UK (public, academic, legal deposit and specialist). Here, the term “cataloger” refers to any member of staff who catalogs printed music.

AB  - O Índice de Final de Livro é um dos instrumentos mais antigos utilizados para Organização e Recuperação da Informação, e sua importância decorre do fato de ser este um dos principais pontos de acesso ao conteúdo de um livro, auxiliando o leitor na compreensão dos conceitos relevantes contidos nos manuscritos. Porém, o processo de elaboração do Índice de Final de Livro no Brasil acontece, geralmente, de maneira manual, o que demanda tempo e custos financeiros, justificando o baixo número de publicações que contêm o índice. Dessa forma, este artigo tem o objetivo de apresentar estudos que discutem sobre o uso da tecnologia na elaboração do índice, a partir de 16 publicações selecionadas pelo processo de levantamento bibliográfico. Os resultados mostraram que as publicações nos primeiros anos apresentaram de forma incipiente a inserção tecnológica e, com o passar dos anos, houve vários relatos de índices produzidos por meio da indexação automática. Conclui-se que são necessários estudos sobre a utilização da indexação semiautomática para auxiliar na elaboração do índice, considerando que a intervenção do indexador, mesmo com o auxílio da tecnologia, continua sendo necessária para explicitar a semântica e o contexto na elaboração de índices, assim como a utilização da tecnologia é necessária para agilizar a finalização do índice.

AB  - Resumo Publicações eletrônicas, apesar dos avanços das Tecnologias da Informação, são ainda calcados no modelo impresso. O formato textual impede que programas possam ser usados para o processamento "semântico" desses conteúdos. È porposto um modelo "semântico" de publicações cientificas eletrônicas, no qual as conclusões contidas no texto do artigo fornecidas por autores e representadas em formato "inteligível" por programas, permitindo recuperação semântica, identificação de indícios de novas descobertas científicas e de incoerências sobre este conhecimento. O modelo se baseia nos conceitos de estrutura profunda, ou semântica, da linguagem (CHOMSKY, 1975), de microestrutura, macroestrutura e superestrutura, (KINTSH, VAN DIJK, 1972), na estrutura retórica de artigos científicos (HUTCHINS, 1977), (GROSS, 1990) e nos elementos de metodologia cientifica, como problema, questão, objetivo, hipótese, experimento e conclusão. Resulta da análise de 89 artigos biomédicos. Foi desenvolvido um protótipo de sistema que implementa parcialmente o modelo. Questionários foram usados com autores para embasar o desenvolvimento do protótipo. O protótipo foi testando com pesquisadores-autores. Foram identificados quatro padrões de raciocínio e encadeamento dos elementos semânticos em artigos científicos. O modelo de conteúdo foi implementado como uma ontologia computacional. Foi desenvolvido e avaliado um protótipo de uma interface web de submissão artigos pelos autores a um sistema eletrônico de publicação de periódicos que implementa o modelo.

AB  - Abstract The Arabic Citation Index (ARCI) was launched in 2020. This article provides an overview of the scientific literature contained in this new database and explores its possible usage in research evaluation. As of May 2022, ARCI had indexed 138,283 scientific publications published between 2015 and 2020. ARCI’s coverage is characterized by using the metadata available in scientific publications. First, I investigate the distributions of the indexed literature at various levels (research domains, countries, languages, open access). Articles make up nearly all the documents indexed with a share of 99% of ARCI. The Arts &amp; Humanities and Social Sciences fields have the highest concentration of publications. Most indexed journals are published in Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. About 8% of publications in ARCI are published in languages other than Arabic. Second, I use an unsupervised machine learning model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and the text mining algorithm of VOSviewer to uncover the main topics in ARCI. These methods provide a better understanding of ARCI’s thematic structure. Next, I discuss how ARCI can complement global standards in the context of a more inclusive research evaluation. Finally, I suggest a few research opportunities after discussing the findings of this study.

AB  - Résumé Pour faire l’état des lieux du libre accès (LA) en France en 2012, dix ans après la Budapest Open Access Initiative, nous avons examiné les deux voies : la voie verte (l’auto-archivage) et la voie dorée (publications dans les revues en LA). L’archive centrale multidisciplinaire HAL, créée en 2002 pour recevoir les publications scientifiques au niveau national, est reconnue pour sa qualité technique, mais elle ne propose que 10% à 15 % de la production scientifique annuelle française. Ce chiffre est à l’image de ce qu’offrent toutes les autres archives dans le monde où il n’y a pas d’obligation de déposer (pas de mandat). Les archives qui ont un mandat comme celle de l’université de Liège, ont atteint un taux de 80% en deux ans. Quelques archives institutionnelles se sont développées en France parallèlement à HAL, et deux d’entre elles (Archimer and OATAO) ont un bon taux de remplissage, grâce à l’implication d’un personnel dédié. Pour soutenir les offres éditoriales en libre accès le Centre pour l'Édition électronique Ouverte (CLEO) a récemment mis en place OpenEdition Freemium. Cette initiative pourrait favoriser le développement des revues en LA. Cependant, l’étude faite à partir des revues qualifiantes en Sciences Humaines et Sociales montre que les chercheurs sont peu encouragés à publier dans ces revues par les instances d’évaluation : peu de revues en libre accès françaises sont présentes dans les listes des revues qualifiantes de l’agence d'évaluation de la recherche et de l'enseignement supérieur (AERES). On note aussi une forte disparité entre les disciplines. Différents exemples de politique en faveur du libre accès sont donnés : un politique forte peut être menée par des universités, comme à l’université de Liège, ou par des bailleurs de fonds, comme le FRS-FNRS en Belgique ou par l’Europe. Elle peut être entreprise au niveau législatif comme aux USA, au Brésil ou en Argentine. En France les deux voies du libre accès sont tracées par des initiatives intéressantes. Le gouvernement français devrait accompagner ces initiatives et devrait s’investir dans une politique forte pour recevoir rapidement les bénéfices du libre accès.

AB  - This essay discusses the concept of discovery, intended as content discovery, and defines it in the new context of Open Science, with a focus on Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Starting from the example of Google Scholar, the authors show that this well established service does not address the current needs, practices, and variety of discovery. Alternatives in terms of technical choices, features, and governance, do however exist, offering richer and more open discovery. The paper presents in particular the implementations and research work of the H2020 project TRIPLE (Transforming Research through Innovative Practices for Linked Interdisciplinary Exploration). Dedicated to the building of a discovery platform for the SSH, the project is meant to address the specificities and evolution of discovery in this field. Prevailing scholarly resource platforms like Google Scholar limit discovery by focussing only on publications, and favouring through their algorithm well-cited papers, English content, and discipline-specific resources. A limitation in the context of cross-disciplinary and collaborative Open Science, such a service more specifically hinders discovery in the SSH. Characterized by a fragmented landscape, a variety of languages, data types, and outputs, research in the SSH requires services that fully exploit discovery potentialities. Moreover, a survey conducted within the TRIPLE project showed that most SSH researchers use Google Scholar as their starting point, and that they recognise the lack of control they have with this system. Beyond the extension of features and content, transparency is the other important criterion for the building of an Open Infrastructure actually serving the research community. In light of this, we present in some detail the GoTriple platform, which exploits today's technological potential and incorporates the best known functionalities in order to unveil more and innovative scholarly outputs and lead to international and interdisciplinary research project collaborations.

AB  - Open on-line access to culture, knowledge and educational resources is an approach that allows different social and economic actors to profit in many ways, such as by reducing inequalities caused by access fees for scientific and educational materials, faster introduction of new solutions, creating possibilities of interdisciplinary projects uniting different participants. It is also an impulse of change in scientific and educational publishing.

AB  - Automatic literature review generation is one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing.Although large language models have tackled literature review generation, the absence of large-scale datasets has been a stumbling block to the progress.We release SciReviewGen, consisting of over 10,000 literature reviews and 690,000 papers cited in the reviews.Based on the dataset, we evaluate recent transformer-based summarization models on the literature review generation task, including Fusion-in-Decoder extended for literature review generation.Human evaluation results show that some machine-generated summaries are comparable to human-written reviews, while revealing the challenges of automatic literature review generation such as hallucinations and a lack of detailed information.Our dataset and code are available at [https://github.com/tetsu9923/SciReviewGen](https://github.com/tetsu9923/SciReviewGen).

AB  - El propósito de este artículo de revisión es el de contribuir al seguimiento y el debate de los cambios en el entorno de la investigación electrónica. Vamos a presentar una visión general (adaptado principalmente a los neófitos del ciberespacio) de algunos de los mejores recursos electrónicos disponibles en línea para la ciencia política, la elaboración de nuestra experiencia como editores de IPSA-Portal, el sitio web de la Asociación Internacional de Ciencia Política dedicada a la selección y revisión los mejores e-hubs en nuestra disciplina. Sin embargo, al aventurarse en el ciberespacio de la ciencia política, vamos a tratar de ofrecer una comprensión más general de las principales tendencias que afectan la galaxia del internet. Por mucho que estemos tentados sólo para pegarnos a nuestro pequeño planeta, tenemos que ser conscientes de que es parte de, y surge de, un sistema mucho más grande.
