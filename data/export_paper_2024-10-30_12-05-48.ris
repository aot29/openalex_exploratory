AB  - The 2014 CrossRef annual meeting and workshops were held at the Royal Society in London from November 11 to 12.They were lively and international events with over 150 attendees from many countries, including Asian countries such as Korea, China, Japan, and India.On the first day, the CrossRef workshops were held.Two parallel sessions were organized in the morning.One was for people who were new to CrossRef and the other was for those who were familiar with the technical aspects of CrossRef.Since I was new to CrossRef, I attended the beginner's session titled "Boot camp: an introduction to CrossRef." Three speakers from Cross-Ref, Carol Meyer, Anna Tolwinska, and Susan Collins, gave presentations on the general introduction of CrossRef, current tools for small publishers, and CrossCheck plagiarism screening respectively.It was a good opportunity for beginners to learn about the CrossRef organization and its products.I thought it was quite impressive that such a small organization founded just 14 years ago had grown into a very important one leading technological innovations in scholarly publishing of the world (Fig. 1).In the other parallel session, on system update, Chuck Koscher, Patricia Feeney, Mike Yalter, and Patricia Feeney gave four successive presentations with the titles "System update: an indepth and technical look at CrossRef, " "Support update and multiple resolution overview, " "DOI co-access for books, " and "Reports and how to use them." This was a technical session mainly for practitioners of the CrossRef products.The multiple resolution is about assigning multiple URLs to a single digital object identifier (DOI).It seems to be important to develop efficient tools for including books into the information space.A plenary session titled "What's new at CrossRef " was held in the afternoon.Three speakers from CrossRef gave presentations.Geoffrey Bilder gave a talk on Text and Data Mining (TDM) application programming interface (API).TDM, a beta service of which was launched in 2014, was an important keyword in this year's CrossRef meeting.I thought this was a wonderful idea that could help researchers greatly.Bilder explained that to develop a TDM API, it was necessary to have an access to full texts and license information.Then he described the TDM workflow and showed a demo.I felt that this would grow to become an important and widely-used product in the near future.In the second talk of the plenary session, Kirsty Meddings gave a presentation on new developments in CrossMark.The CrossMark logo identifies a publisher-maintained copy of a piece of content and provides important publication record information.A new development was

AB  - Forensics of digital data are concerned with identifying, acquiring, processing, analysing, and reporting on electronic data. Multimedia forensics focuses on investigating computer crimes using forensic methods. The analysis of multimedia evidence is the role of multimedia forensics, on the other hand. In the analysis, digital evidence is evaluated scientifically to maintain its integrity, to find its source, and to authenticate it. There are several methods in multimedia forensics, such as the implementation of deep learning. The purpose of this research is to conduct bibliometric analysis in multimedia forensics and deep learning by using the data gathered from Scopus index on the keyword “multimedia forensics and deep learning”. The result is 68 relevant papers were found in the range of 2017-2022. The results of this research can be used by researchers as a reference when conducting research and determining the research themes to be pursued.

AB  - One of the most important tasks in scientific publishing is the articles' evaluation via the editorial board and the reviewers' community. Additionally, in scientific publishing great concern exists regarding the peer-review process and how it can be further optimised to decrease the time from submission to the first decision, as well as increase the objectivity of the reviewers' remarks ensuring that no bias or human error exists in the reviewing process. In order to address this issue, our article suggests a novice cloud framework for manuscript submission based on blockchain technology that further enhances the anonymity between authors and reviewers alike. Our method covers the whole spectrum of current submission systems capabilities, but it also provides a decentralised solution using open-source tools such as Java Spring that enhance the anonymity of the reviewing process.

TI  - Abstracts and Abstracting: A Genre and Set of Skills for the Twenty-First Century
IS  - 4
VL  - 100
AU  - Blobaum, Paul
AB  - Reading abstracts is part of the usual routine for reference librarians, especially those employed in health sciences and academic settings. The importance of abstracts to knowledge transfer and to the library and information science field is overlooked and deserves review. This book is written to fill a void in recent English-language books on this important subject. Tibor Koltay is a library and information science professor in the Faculty of Applied and Professional Arts, Szent Istvan University, Jaszbereny, Hungary. Koltay approaches the topic of abstracts and abstracting as both a literary genre and a process. The author intends the book for an interdisciplinary audience: professional abstractors, researchers who publish in scholarly journals, linguists, and language arts teachers. Librarians would also benefit from this book, especially those serving scholarly writers, researchers, and the higher education community.Koltay discusses theoretical interdisciplinary underpinnings of abstracting along with chapters on the practical skill and knowledge needed to write good abstracts. Koltay theorizes that there are three types of abstracts: the frequently used informative abstract that summarizes important methods and findings contained in the article, the indicative abstract that describes the content but does not report data in the article, and abstracts that are both indicative and informative. Librarians who love to read theoretical discussions will find much here to keep them absorbed, but the theoretical chapters can be skipped or skimmed to focus on more practical discussions, such as what exactly an abstractor has to know and what the process of writing abstracts is. A discussion of the limitations of author abstracts (those written by the author of a manuscript) versus those of professional abstractors and the connection to information literacy and database searching are among the many useful discussions.Koltay seems familiar with the North American library scene, quoting information literacy standards of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), and the use of familiar databases such as EBSCOhost's Academic Search Premier. A chapter with examples and discussion is also provided.American readers will need to adjust to British spellings and didactic style, and forge ahead through acronyms that are not always explained or found in the index. After working through these limitations, readers will find that this book contains useful, well-documented knowledge that can be used to help authors write better abstracts and can be used in teaching the scholarly publishing process. The book can be used as a self-help guide to learn the abstracting process and could be used in library and information science courses, but the cost may be prohibitive. This book is recommended for academic libraries, especially those supporting graduate programs and researchers who publish, but is optional for the typical hospital and public library.

AB  - Academics (should) strive to submit to journals which are academically sound and scholarly. To achieve this, they could either submit to journals that appear exclusively on safelists (occasionally referred to as whitelists, although this term tends to be avoided), or avoid submitting to journals on watchlists (occasionally referred to as blacklists, although this term tends to be avoided). The most well-known of these lists was curated by Jeffrey Beall. Beall’s Lists (there are two, one for stand-alone journals and one for publishers) were taken offline by Beall himself in January 2017. Prior to 2017, Beall’s Lists were widely cited and utilized, including to make quantitative claims about scholarly publishing. Even after Beall’s Lists became obsolete (they have not been maintained for the past six years), they continue to be widely cited and used. This paper argues that the use of Beall’s Lists, pre- and post-2017, may constitute a methodological error and, even if papers carry a disclaimer or limitations section noting this weakness, their conclusions cannot always be relied upon. This paper also argues for the need to conduct a detailed post-publication assessment of reports in the literature that used Beall’s Lists to validate their findings and conclusions, assuming that it becomes accepted that Beall’s Lists are not a reliable resource for scientific investigation. Finally, this paper contends that any papers that have identified methodological errors should be corrected. Several lists that were cloned from Beall’s Lists have also emerged and are also being cited. These should also be included in any post-publication investigation that is conducted.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper briefly describes the rapidly changing research evaluation and funding landscape in Australian universities, specifically in relation to open access and institutional repositories. Recent announcements indicate that funding and evaluation bodies are becoming increasingly concerned that publicly funded research be made publicly available. The paper then reports a survey of all levels of academic staff plus research students at one Australian university, conducted in May 2006, prior to the introduction of an institutional repository. The survey, in line with previously reported surveys, found that while there was a high level of engagement with scholarly publishing, there was a low level of awareness of, or concern with, either open access (‘green’ or ‘gold’) or the roles repositories can play in increasing accessibility of research. Practically, this indicates that much work needs to be done within this university to increase knowledge of, and change behaviours with regard to, open access and repositories if the university and its academics are to make the most of new funding requirements and research evaluation processes.

AB  - This article theorizes the functional relationship between the human components (i.e., scholars) and non-human components (i.e., structural configurations) of academic domains. It is organized around the following question: in what ways have scholars formed and been formed by the structural configurations of their academic domain? The article uses as a case study the academic domain of education and technology to examine this question. Its authorship approach is innovative, with a worldwide collection of academics (99 authors) collaborating to address the proposed question based on their reflections on daily social and academic practices. This collaboration followed a three-round process of contributions via email. Analysis of these scholars’ reflective accounts was carried out, and a theoretical proposition was established from this analysis. The proposition is of a mutual (yet not necessarily balanced) power (and therefore political) relationship between the human and non-human constituents of an academic realm, with the two shaping one another. One implication of this proposition is that these non-human elements exist as political ‘actors’, just like their human counterparts, having ‘agency’ – which they exercise over humans. This turns academic domains into political (functional or dysfunctional) ‘battlefields’ wherein both humans and non-humans engage in political activities and actions that form the identity of the academic domain. For more information about the authorship approach, please see Al Lily AEA (2015) A crowd-authoring project on the scholarship of educational technology.

AB  - Readers have another perspective. 1For journals, their perspective initially was shaped largely by ecosystems created by scholarly publishers and libraries; for books, their perspective is shaped as much by Amazon and Google.Amazon's pervasive reading interfaces, robust cross-device syncing, seamless delivery from numerous publishers, and familiar discovery environment set high expectations for book discovery and delivery.Scholars, at least, regularly pay out of pocket to read e-books through the Kindle and similar ecosystems.In academic e-book environments, scholars and students have the fragmented experience of numerous platforms, the unavailability of many titles, discovery limitations, multiple confusing digital rights management (DRM) solutions, and poor device support.Since most academic readers have had at least some experience with both ecosystems, they have the ability to evaluate them comparatively.Even without out-of-pocket costs, the academic e-book ecosystem poses comparative barriers for readers.Reading is not the only, and indeed perhaps not the most important, use for scholarly books.Search and browse functions, enabled in print books through tables of contents, illustrations, and indices, are vital to humanists who only sometimes read a book cover to cover.Although there is some evidence that scholars and students alike have continued to prefer reading in print, these other functions are eased tremendously by using e-books and online tools (Housewright, Schonfeld, & Wulfson, 2013; see especially the discussion around Figure 14 on pages 31-32).Notably, Google Books offers an outstanding discovery experience, not only in searching for books but perhaps even more importantly in searching for phrases and ideas within books, offering a powerful supplement, if not a substitute, for the traditional index.Google Books may not be widely used as a source for reading, but for many scholars it is an outstanding complementary resource that indicates another important way in which scholars and students use e-books (Rutner & Schonfeld, 2012; see especially pages 17-19 and 44).At this early stage in the development of scholarly e-books, there is every reason to believe that expectations for discovery, reading, and perhaps other uses are being set by one major ecosystem (Kindle) and a small set of other major initiatives (especially Google Books).If this is true, there may be other approaches that libraries and content platforms should consider.For example, they might determine that it makes more sense to find ways to work as a part of Foreword | iii this consumer ecosystem, or they might create a more coherent user experience that offers an academic alternative to the consumer ecosystem.Ultimately, librarians should bear in mind that user experience does not begin and end with a single content platform.Even when the experience is strong on a single content platform, readers experience the oftenawkward transitions across platforms and challenges moving books seamlessly into reading-optimized interfaces.Libraries may find it helpful to consider these issues more systematically rather than as a part of a selection and procurement process.Indeed, these processes often show their limits in trying to manage a format transition no less fundamental than that from scroll to codex.Content platforms, too, may find that by interoperating more seamlessly and serving the reading experience more richly, they will attract more readers to digital formats.The introduction of e-books offers some very exciting opportunities for the academic community.Recognizing the place of academic e-books in relation to a broader consumer e-book ecosystem may suggest opportunities to embrace this new format more fully.notE 1.I use the term "reader" in this piece to indicate individuals whose objective is to read a book, in whatever format.Individuals who have other objectives with books, such as skimming the illustrations, consulting an index, or conducting text mining, are grouped generally as "users."Readers and users alike take many steps, and have many needs, in order to find and use one or more books.

AB  - <p indent=0mm>Focusing on the expression, conception, creative means and presentation characteristics of scientific articles, this paper carries out the exploration and research on the development trends of scientific articles driven by technology. (1) The expression of scientific articles: Towards atomization. With the development of reading style, discipline development, academic communications and emerging technology, the phenomenon of fragmentation in the process of scientific research and publishing has become increasingly prominent, which forces the author’s writing style and article form to change. The future article is likely to be atomized articles with propositions and insights, which can be ideas, data and observations, or opinions. The content tends to be short and concise; in reading, it is more in line with the needs of human fragmented knowledge acquisition, but also conducive to machine identification, discovery, sharing and replication; and more diversified in presentation. (2) The conception of scientific articles: Providing better insights. AI constantly adapts to the more and more complex environment, improves the generalization ability of AI, and efficiently obtains hidden causality from structured data, which is not affected by physiological and psychological state, provides reliable and error-free analysis ability, and innovates the analysis method and efficiency of data. At the same time, AI has more powerful storage capacity and faster computing power, runs stably, helps researchers to improve the processing and analysis of data, provides researchers with more profound insights and support, and at the same time makes opinions more predictable and standardized, and enhances human decision-making ability. (3) The creation of scientific articles: The coexistence of UGC/PGC/OGC/MGC mode. MGC creation is the direction of intellectual media, and it will also be the mainstream form of articles creation in the future. With the help of machine intelligence, researchers can produce professional content more efficiently and realize the evolution road of intelligence specialization and intelligence of all things. Of course, the development of the Internet era is not a new model rapidly replacing another model, this change is usually relatively gradual, sudden far-reaching and fundamental changes are even less, so the future scientific articles creation is still the era of the coexistence of UGC/PGC/OGC/MGC mode. (4) The presentation of scientific articles: Giving readers the greatest freedom to read. In terms of the development of the whole society, interactivity is an important direction of today’s technological development, and “Taobao waiter” is the best illustration. For interactive articles, readers can change the underlying code and generate modified charts in order to better understand, verify or reconstruct the relevant work, and give readers more freedom to read; MR/VR/AR gives readers a more three-dimensional reading experience; articles have increasingly become web content, and hyperlinks have become a new way of literature citation. We can not only link the literature, but also link the comments of the “cited” references, and judge the starting point, breadth and depth of the articles according to the authority of the linked commentators. The innovative expression of scientific articles brings changes to the form of scientific research, academic innovation and discipline ecology, which makes full communication and interaction among researchers; the deep integration of emerging technologies and scientific journals will have a great impact on the development of science.

AB  - A Review of:Buitrago Ciro, J. (2022). How are academic libraries in Spanish-speaking Latin America responding to new models of scholarly communication and predatory publishing? Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 54(3), 373–388. https://doi.org/10.1177/09610006211016533Objective – To examine the current state of knowledge among academic librarians in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America regarding open access and predatory publishing. Furthermore, the study sought to explore actions or potential plans among this group that could allow them to better assist researchers with these aspects of scholarly publishing literacy. Design – An online survey, followed by interviews with self-selected participants. Setting – Academic libraries in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. Subjects – 104 librarians in the online survey and seven librarians in the interviews, each holding a position in an academic library in Spanish-speaking Latin America. Methods – An anonymous survey in Spanish consisting of 34 required questions was built with SurveyMonkey and distributed to participants between 30 July 2020 and 20 September 2020. Survey respondents were directed to contact the author via email if they wished to participate in follow-up interviews. Interviews were then conducted in Spanish over Zoom between 10 October 2020 and 10 November 2020, and the transcripts were coded and analyzed with NVivo. Main Results – Of the survey’s respondents, 31.73% indicated that their library has a scholarly communication librarian, 29.81% noted that the library receives requests for assistance with finding journals in which to publish at least once per week, and 16.35% reported this type of request at least 1-2 times per month. In specific regard to predatory publishing, almost 52.88% of respondents indicated that they never receive questions on this topic, and 25.00% answered that users seek this kind of information less than once per month. Additionally, 31.73% responded that information on predatory publishing is not available at their library, and 42.31% rated their own knowledge of predatory publishing as fair to very poor. Finally, 44.23% reported plans to develop training or information to educate their institution’s research communities about predatory publishing, and 2.88% planned to recruit a scholarly communications specialist. In interviews, all participants agreed that exchanging information with other institutions with more knowledge and services related to predatory publishing would be beneficial. Three interviewees saw a general role for the library in providing information on predatory publishing, and three others indicated that this should be a leadership role when working in conjunction with other departments. All participants saw a lack of knowledge about predatory publishing as one of the primary difficulties for academic libraries, and three reported that the survey itself had led them to recognize the importance of the library’s role in scholarly communication literacy and create plans for their library to assist researchers in regard to predatory publishing. Conclusion – Academic libraries in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America are not yet offering robust support for researchers concerning predatory publishing, but there is growing recognition of the issue, as well as interest in further developing expertise among librarians. Collaboration and exchanges of information with other institutions with more developed resources related to predatory publishing is viewed positively and may build upon existing knowledge of open access publishing.

AB  - Collaboration has increased in importance in academic libraries over the past several years, both as a value and a model of work. While certainly not a new concept, cooperative work with campus partners, external partners, and within the library itself has become increasingly common. In Academic Libraries and Collaborative Research Services, editor Carrie Forbes (University of Denver) brings together a wide variety of perspectives on internal and external library collaborations. Fourteen chapters are divided into four sections, with topics including liaison work, cross-institutional and cross-continental partnerships, evidence synthesis, data literacy, and open scholarship. Academic librarians of all experience levels and in a wide variety of roles will be able to find something relevant to their work.

AB  - As technology has advanced, scholarly communication has evolved, creating new opportunities for academic libraries to serve researchers. This article examines the current state and potential future of academic library-based publishing. The review of the literature explores the scholarly communication ecosystem as it pertains to new publishing paradigms supported by academic libraries, including the complexity of nontraditional publishing models. These models and their implications, as well as how they may be implemented, are then explored in the academic library environment. Next, survey data from nineteen academic librarians collected at the American Library Association Midwinter Meeting in January 2015 is presented. Based on the literature and the survey data, this article argues that the principle concerns for academic library-based publishing going forward include 1) the need for the dedicated and/or sustained financial models for library-based publishing initiatives and 2) the cultural and financial capital to support librarians as they further expand their knowledge and expertise to support additional publishing-related functionalities in support of these new models. Both of these concerns ultimately tie to the persistent question of perceived quality, and by extension, reputation, of library-based publishing and open access publishing more broadly.

AB  - ABSTRACT The job titles and career paths of people transitioning between academia and scholarly publishing, and of those who are progressing within their publishing careers, has been little studied and lacks accepted frameworks, ‘route‐maps’, and taxonomies. Much of the work done to date provides merely a ‘snapshot’ of the current demographics of the publishing workforce at particular moment, and tends not to offer insight into pathways, trajectories, or momentum. This preliminary survey, involving around 150 scholarly publishers, reveals insights into job titles, progressions, and transitions, and exposes some of the reasons for transitions between academia and publishing. The analysis suggests that these transitions and career paths can be systematically studied and documented, for use both by individuals considering their own careers, and by planners and managers in academic institutions and scholarly publishing organizations.

AB  - While there is significant progress with policy and a lively debate regarding the potential impact of open access publishing, few studies have examined academics' behavior and attitudes to open access publishing (OAP) in scholarly journals. This article seeks to address this gap through an international and interdisciplinary survey of academics. Issues covered include: use of and intentions regarding OAP, and perceptions regarding advantages and disadvantages of OAP, journal article publication services, peer review, and reuse. Despite reporting engagement in OAP, academics were unsure about their future intentions regarding OAP. Broadly, academics identified the potential for wider circulation as the key advantage of OAP, and were more positive about its benefits than they were negative about its disadvantages. As regards services, rigorous peer review, followed by rapid publication were most valued. Academics reported strong views on reuse of their work; they were relatively happy with noncommercial reuse, but not in favor of commercial reuse, adaptations, and inclusion in anthologies. Comparing science, technology, and medicine with arts, humanities, and social sciences showed a significant difference in attitude on a number of questions, but, in general, the effect size was small, suggesting that attitudes are relatively consistent across the academic community.

AB  - ABSTRACT Access to knowledge is a critical issue when intellectual property rights are debated among governments in such fora as the World Intellectual Property Organization and the World Trade Organization. Scientific and scholarly materials became available online long before other types of copyright‐protected works, such as music and films. It is therefore particularly interesting to analyse how this specific field of publishing has adapted to the new digital landscape. Lessons can be learnt from related business sectors. Licensing is a key component in creating access, on terms and conditions that are fair and balanced for users in all parts of the world; this will encourage writing and publishing both now and in the future.

TI  - A Century of Progress? Adaptation of the Chemistry Library at the University of Chicago.
IS  - 44
AU  - Twiss-Brooks, Andrea
AB  - During its nearly 100-year history, the Chemistry Library at the University of Chicago and its librarians have responded to changes in the university and in society, including changes in the practice of librarianship, scientific publishing, chemical research, and higher education. A century of discussion about the benefits and shortcomings of departmental libraries has also appeared in the library literature. A review of this literature highlighted a set of issues that influence organizations in their decisions to support departmental libraries or to consolidate these branch libraries into centralized facilities. In the case of the University of Chicago's Chemistry Library, the relative importance of these various issues changed over time, and led to periodic changes in library services, physical facilities, and collection practices. Eventually, the traditional departmental library model gave way to changes in the institution and in scholarly publishing, creating a "tipping point" which led to the current centralization of the collections and services.

AB  - Purpose Many open source software packages are available for organizations and individuals to create digital libraries (DLs). However, a simple to use instrument to evaluate these DL software packages does not exist. The objectives of the present work are to develop a checklist for DL evaluation and use this checklist on four DL software packages. Design/methodology/approach Features that characterized “good” open source DL software were determined from the literature. First identified were essential categories of features that DL software should possess. These categories were then decomposed into supporting features. From these, a checklist that covered all such features was developed. The checklist was then used to evaluate four popular open source DL software packages (CDSware, EPrints, Fedora, and Greenstone) for the purposes of assessing suitability for use in a DL project to be undertaken by the authors. Findings A checklist consisting of 12 categories of items was developed. Using this, Greenstone was found to be the best performer, followed by CDSware, Fedora and EPrints. Greenstone was the only software package that consistently fulfilled the majority of the criteria in many of the checklist categories. In contrast, EPrints was the worst performer due to its poor support for certain features deemed important in our checklist, and a total absence of functionality in other categories. Originality/value The present work attempts to develop a comprehensive checklist for assessing DLs. Its flexibility allows users to tailor it to accommodate new categories, items and weighting schemes to reflect the needs of different DL implementations.

AB  - Persistent identifiers (PID) to identify digital representations of physical specimens in natural science collections (i.e., digital specimens) unambiguously and uniquely on the Internet are one of the mechanisms for digitally transforming collections-based science. Digital Specimen PIDs contribute to building and maintaining long-term community trust in the accuracy and authenticity of the scientific data to be managed and presented by the Distributed System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo) research infrastructure planned in Europe to commence implementation in 2024. Not only are such PIDs valid over the very long timescales common in the heritage sector but they can also transcend changes in underlying technologies of their implementation. They are part of the mechanism for widening access to natural science collections. DiSSCo technical experts previously selected the Handle System as the choice to meet core PID requirements. Using a two-step approach, this options appraisal captures, characterises and analyses different alternative Handle-based PID schemes and the possible operational modes of use. In a first step a weighting and ranking the options has been applied followed by a structured qualitative assessment of social and technical compliance across several assessment dimensions: levels of scalability, community trust, persistence, governance, appropriateness of the scheme and suitability for future global adoption. The results are discussed in relation to branding, community perceptions and global context to determine a preferred PID scheme for DiSSCo that also has potential for adoption and acceptance globally. DiSSCo will adopt a ‘driven-by DOI’ persistent identifier (PID) scheme customised with natural sciences community characteristics. Establishing a new Registration Agency in collaboration with the International DOI Foundation is a practical way forward to support the FAIR (findable, accessible interoperable, reusable) data architecture of DiSSCo research infrastructure. This approach is compatible with the policies of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and is aligned to existing practices across the global community of natural science collections.

AB  - An open access repository or open archive is a digital platform that holds research output and provides free, immediate and permanent access to research results for anyone to use, download and distribute. To facilitate open access such repositories must be interoperable according to the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). Search engines harvest the content of open access repositories, constructing a database of worldwide, free of charge available research. OpenDOAR is the quality-assured, global Directory of Open Access Repositories. Its repositories provide free, open access to academic outputs and resources. This paper deals with Comparative analysis of India and Australia repositories listed in OpenDOAR in terms of their growth, type, operational status, content type, software, subject coverage, language and policies regarding content, submission, and preservation.

AB  - The disciplinary culture theory presumes that if a scholar has been familiar with self-archiving through an existing subject-based repository, this scholar will be more enthusiastic about contributing his/her research to an institutional repository than one who has not had the experience. To test the theory, this article examines self-archiving practices of a group of physicists in both a subject repository and an institutional repository. It does not find a correlation between a disciplinary culture and self-archiving practices.

AB  - SUMMARY As serial prices rise exponentially and budgets plummet, serials aficionados can still increase access to information by adding bibliographic records for open access journals to library catalogs. Anna Hood shared procedures and practices on how she is adding value to her library's catalog by adding such records. Bridging the gap between users and open access journals in such a manner allows for true openness. An open access journal is not truly “open” unless we take the time to unrestrict and make them available to all.

AB  - Summary The issue of commercial advertising in academic journals is complex and controversial. It is complex because its implications reveal deeply embedded conceptions of the academy and the marketplace both traditionally and in this historical moment. It is controversial because those same implications promise that change is what this historical moment foreshadows, and change has a way of impacting the norms of tradition. The question then becomes, is there a way to synthesize these conceptions of the academy and the marketplace, perhaps in the form of unobtrusive advertising? This article considers the notion of additive change, developed by Ronald C. Arnett and Pat Arneson, as a concept for thinking through the serials crisis in academia and the marketplace.

AU  - Šobota, Dijana

AB  - After twenty years of the open access movement, there has been growth in the uptake of open access, and some progress has been made in achieving its original goals; however, results have been far from satisfactory, with more than half of the research literature still closed (COKI, 2022; Curry, 2018). Moreover, new concerns have arisen, such as questionable quality and the reliability of peer review, in particular predatory publishing. There are also threats to equity, including stratifications of publishing as a consequence of the exclusionary character of the author-pays model of open access, and new risks of bias and exclusion in the means of transparent evaluation (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2022). It is argued that these challenges are the result of the uncritical narratives of openness and their narrow focus on access alone which fail to address inequitable power dynamics, systemic problems and the structural barriers in scholarly publishing and knowledge production (Perry, 2020; ibid.).These cha(lle)nges in the system of scholarly communication, coupled with recent advances in technology and the tectonic transformations in the information environment, require new (pedagogical) approaches and foci that would enable researchers and students to understand and navigate such a complex environment; for this, a holistic and integrative approach to scholarly communication and information literacy is needed (ACRL, 2013; Špiranec, 2015).Scholarly communication, including open access, is impossible without information literacy (Hebrang Grgić, 2016). As they are both concerned with (access to) information, open access and in particular critical information literacy largely share the same goals, ethical dimensions and values of (social and epistemic) justice, equity and democratisation. Indeed, they have been considered instrumental to achieving these, and even proclaimed a panacea and deus ex machina for the current scientific, social and political challenges and crises (Hebrang Grgić, 2016; Kapitzke, 2003). However, literature on the intersections and interplay between open access and information literacy has been limited.This paper seeks to intertwine these two concepts more strongly, for mutual exchange and benefit, by analysing their convergent aspects as well as the role information literacy has in the context of the complexities of the scholarly communication system and in achieving open access. The paper builds on the few empirical studies of the intersections between the two concepts (e.g. Hebrang Grgić (2016) which confirms the importance of ‘open access literacy’), but goes beyond their functional approaches, advocating a more holistic and critical approach to open access to help reinvent it and make a more substantial progress in open access. It argues that the transformations in the information environment and the scholarly communication system require not only basic skills and competences at the core of information literacy but also specific skills of, for instance, managing scientific data and publishing in open access sources. More importantly, what is also required is critical consciousness of all the aspects of the research process including the context, power relationships, and the privileged positions in knowledge production, publishing and dissemination, and an ability to evaluate the quality and reliability of information.The paper proposes critical open access literacy as a pedagogical methodology and strategy to confront the challenges and enable a critical understanding of the contemporary information environment and scholarly communication. In line with the tenets of critical information literacy, critical open access literacy is directed at an analysis and critique of the economic, social, political, legal and technological conditions, aspects and implications of open access and the overall scholarly communication system, as well as the power dynamics, tensions and flaws within them. This will empower students and researchers to navigate this environment successfully and potentially become champions of its transformation to make it more meaningful, reliable, equitable and democratic.

TI  - Addressing the K-12 Open Educational Resources Awareness Niche: A Virtual Conference Response
IS  - 1
VL  - 67
AU  - Blomgren, Constance
AU  - Henderson, Serena
C1  - Athabasca University
AB  - Since the 2002 UNESCO forum, raising awareness of the benefits and challenges to Open Educational Resources (OER) in higher education have been integral to the broader Open Education (OE) movement. In the K-12 sector, however, an understanding of OER has been less advanced, although there are pockets of K-12 OER innovators throughout Canada and the United States. The 2015 U.S. Department of Education #GoOpen initiative, had over 20 American states move toward the use of K-12 OER, and within Canada, various provinces have begun investigating OER for both financial and pedagogical reasons. Because the use of K-12 OER inheres curricular decisions from the classroom teacher to all levels of governance, the move toward OER additionally involves a variety of sophisticated and complex digital and system-wide supports. This shift from the legacy educational system to the emerging practices where educators employ participatory technologies to curate, share out, and use student-generated curricular content requires awareness-building of these pedagogical and technological changes. Despite these impending shifts, the awareness, use, and the advocacy for K-12 OER as a nascent topic for professional learning, at present there are no dedicated specialist councils or professional organizations to support Canadian K-12 OER educators. To address this professional learning need, a virtual satellite conference was offered for in-service teachers as part of a network supported through the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), the Right to Research coalition, and the OpenCon platform. The OpenCon 2018 K-12 Athabasca virtual conference offered free professional learning regarding these changes in resource sourcing, creating, licensing, and sharing. Through meeting software, K-12 educators from Canada and beyond were able to learn about OER, Open Pedagogy, and the implications these changes bring to the teaching and learning processes. The virtual conference concluded with the Remix Panel that catalyzed topics from an OpenCon17 Berlin higher education discussion, remixing them for the K-12 context. Because this virtual conference has no precedent within Canada, the organizers of this inaugural event summarize its planning and execution, and explicate the significance of offering and archiving the presentations as part of the initiative to build a stronger awareness and understanding of K-12 OER current practices. Key words: open educational resources, open pedagogy, online teacher professional development, virtual conference, reflection-on-action Depuis le forum de l’UNESCO en 2002, la sensibilisation quant aux avantages et aux défis liés aux Ressources éducatives libres (REL) dans le contexte des études supérieures fait partie intégrante du mouvement pour l’éducation ouverte. Dans le domaine M-12 par contre, les REL sont moins bien connues, bien qu’il y ait des îlots d’innovateurs en REL partout au Canada et aux États-Unis. L’initiative du département de l’éducation des États-Unis en 2015, #GoOpen, a poussé plus de 20 états américains à se tourner vers l’emploi des REL de la maternelle à la 12e année. Au Canada, certaines provinces ont commencé à se pencher vers les REL pour des raisons financières et pédagogiques. Puisque l’emploi des REL dans un contexte M-12 implique des décisions relatives aux programmes scolaires, de l’enseignant en salle de classe jusqu’à tous les niveaux de gouvernance, la transition vers les REL implique également divers soutiens numériques sophistiqués et complexes à l’échelle du système. Cette transition vers des pratiques émergentes selon lesquelles les enseignants emploient des technologies participatives pour organiser, distribuer et utiliser du contenu pédagogique créé par les élèves exige une sensibilisation quant à ces changements pédagogiques et technologiques. Malgré ces changements imminents, la sensibilisation, l’utilisation et la promotion des REL de la maternelle à la 12e année comme sujet émergent en développement professionnel, il n’existe présentement aucun conseil spécialisé ni aucune organisation professionnelle pour appuyer les enseignants canadiens en M-12 relativement aux REL. Afin de répondre à ce besoin en formation professionnelle, une conférence satellite virtuelle a été offerte au personnel enseignant en service par un réseau appuyé par la Coalition de l’édition savante et des ressources académiques, la Right to Research coalition et la plateforme OpenCon. La conférence virtuelle OpenCon de Athabasca University en 2018 a offert un apprentissage professionnel gratuit sur ces changements touchant la recherche, la création, la concession de licences et le partage de ressources. Par le biais de logiciels de réunions virtuelles, du personnel enseignant M-12 du Canada et ailleurs ont pu apprendre sur les REL, la pédagogie ouverte et l’impact de ces changements sur les pratiques en enseignement et en apprentissage. La conférence virtuelle s’est terminée par le Remix Panel qui a fait la promotion de thèmes abordés lors d’une discussion portant sur les études supérieures à OpenCon17 Berlin tout en les adaptant au contexte M-12. Cette conférence virtuelle n’ayant aucun précédent au Canada, les organisateurs de cet événement inaugural en résument la planification et la mise en œuvre et expliquent la signification d’offrir et d’archiver les présentations dans le cadre de l’initiative visant une meilleure sensibilisation et compréhension des pratiques actuelles impliquant les REL en M-12.

AB  - Abstract Citations are crucial artifacts to provide additional information to the reader to comprehend the research under concern. There are different roles that citations play in scientific discourse. Correctly identifying the intent of the citations finds applications ranging from predicting scholarly impact, finding idea propagation, to text summarization. With the rapid growth in scientific literature, the need for automated methods to classify citations is now growing intense. However, we can only fully understand the intent of a citation if we look at the citation context in the citing paper and also the primary purpose of the cited article. In this work, we propose a neural multi-task learning framework that harnesses the structural information of the research papers and the cited paper’s information for the effective classification of citation intents. We analyze the impact of three auxiliary tasks on the performance of our approach for citation classification. Our experiments on three benchmark citation classification datasets show that incorporating cited paper information (title) shows that our deep neural model achieves a new state-of-the-art on the ACL-ARC dataset with an absolute increase of 5.3% in the F1 score over the previous best model. We also achieve comparable performance with respect to the best-performing systems in the SDP 2021 3C Shared task on Citation Context Classification.

AB  - With increasing volumes of research output and the continued emergence of new publishing venues, scholarly publishing has become a crowded landscape. This study analyses the factors that influence LIS authors when selecting a journal for submission, and in particular the significance of open access (OA) options and bibliometric indicators in this decision-making process. An online questionnaire with Likert scales was used to collect and rank the preferences and attitudes of LIS professionals. As part of the analysis, two separate sub-groups were examined using inferential statistical tests to explore if the research-practice divide so often cited in the LIS literature is also replicated in journal selection. It is concluded that choosing a journal for LIS research is a complex decision for both faculty members and librarians. Whilst some commonality exists between both groups, many variables show evidence of a divide in practices and preferences in consonance with the existing research.

AB  - ORCID, the Open Researcher and Contributor ID, is a nonprofit, community-driven effort to create and maintain a registry of unique researcher identifiers and a transparent method of linking research activities and outputs to these identifiers.Together with other persistent identifiers for scholarly works such as digital object identifiers (DOIs) and identifiers for organizations, ORCID makes research more discoverable.It helps ensure that one's grants, publications and outputs are correctly attributed.It helps the research community not just in aggregating publications, but in every stage of research, viz.publishing, reviewing, profiling, metrics, accessing and archiving.Funding agencies in Austria, Australia, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden and the UK, and the world's leading scholarly publishers and associations have integrated their systems with ORCID registry.Among the BRICS countries, China and South Africa are adopting ORCID avidly.India is yet to make a beginning.If research councils and funding agencies in India require researchers to adopt ORCID and link ORCID iDs to funding as well as tracking performance, it will help them keep track of the workflow.Journal editors can also keep track of contributions made by different authors and work assigned to different reviewers through their ORCID iDs.Natl Med J India 2016;29:e1-e8 'needless ambiguity and confusion' caused by authors who omit parts of their names and initials in their published works, and recommended that 'scientists who are just now embarking on their careers would be well advised to measure the information content on their names as they appear in indexes such as Index Medicus, Physics Abstracts, Biological Abstracts and Science Citation Index.' 1 Some 12 years later, he wrote a detailed paper on the problems the scholarly world faces on account of mere names of people. 2 He had reasons to worry more than anyone else; as the publisher of Science Citation Index, Current Contents and several other search and indexing tools for the world's scientists and scholars, he had the unenviable task of processing millions of papers and author names not only in the byline of these papers but also in the references cited in them and rendering these author names accurately and attributing research papers to the right authors and institutions within a few weeks of publication.People hail from all parts of the world and from different cultures, each having its own peculiarities in naming their people so much so people from one culture may find names of another strange.Added to that are the ways names from different cultures and languages are transliterated into the Roman script.The names in most parts of the western world have three parts, viz. the first name (or given name), middle name and last name (also called the family name or surname).Often the last name may have more than one word, e.g.Duncan Smith, von Braun, van der Waals, de Solla Price.The prefix 'van' in some names may be spelt with a capital V, albeit rarely, e.g.Van de Graaff (of generator fame).In some cultures there are a very large number of people having the same surname.For example, close to 85% of China's population have one of only 129 surnames, and three names in particular, viz.Wang, Li and Chen, are predominant among authors publishing currently.Also there are two Chinese surnames that can be spelt as Wang when publishing in English language, says Jane Qiu. 3 Eight Chinese names transliterate in Roman script into Wei Wang and to avoid ambiguity in such cases journals may allow authors the option to include their names in their own language in parentheses after the transliterated name. 4Among Korean authors, Kim and Park account for a large percentage.In India there are many Agarwals, Guptas, Mukherjees, Raos, Sharmas and Singhs among publishing authors.While some Indians have two-part surnames, e.g.

AB  - Following the emergence of electronic resources (e-resources), librarians developed licensing guidelines, standards, models, and understandings to educate, increase efficiencies, and retain rights afforded by copyright law. To reduce licensing burdens, the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) released the Shared E-Resource Understanding (SERU) in 2008, a set of “understandings” created and agreed upon by libraries and vendors. The author conducted a survey in 2017 of licensing practices and SERU use at libraries. The survey analyzed 108 responses from US academic libraries signing at least one license in the twelve months preceding the survey.

Open Access (OA) publishing, where the articles are freely readable on the net, has slowly increased its market share to near 20 percent but has failed to fulfill the visions of rapid proliferation predicted by many early proponents. The growth of OA has also been very uneven across fields of science. We report market shares of open access in 18 Scopus-indexed disciplines ranging from 27 percent (agriculture) to 7 percent (business). The differences become far more pronounced for journals published in the four countries that dominate commercial scholarly publishing (US, UK, Germany, and the Netherlands). We present contrasting developments within six academic disciplines. Availability of funding to pay publication charges, pressure from research funding agencies, and the diversity of discipline-specific research communication cultures arise as potential explanations for the observed differences.

AB  - Sometimes it’s hard to find answers for work-related questions. This difficulty is compounded when one lacks the means to engage with a community of peers who face similar situations and problems. As institutional repository (IR) managers, we found ourselves with access to resources and listservs that didn’t quite fit our needs. Available discussion spaces were either too general in scope, drowning out repository-specific concerns; or too narrowly focused on platform-specific issues and technical details.

AB  - Scholarly publishing has undergone major changes over the past 50 years. Funder mandates and organisational reporting obligations have heralded the creation of open access repositories, such as institutional and subject repositories. This research draws upon the US PubMed Central (PMC) and Europe PMC, also known as PMC International, as a role model to inform the concept and opportunity for an Australasia open access biomedical repository. PMC International is a leader in making citations and research output, which link to research data, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). As repositories approach two decades of development, this paper reports on the potential for an Australasia open access biomedical repository through a knowledge management lens and explores the opportunities for future open access biomedical repositories.

AB  - This article is a contribution towards an understanding of open access (OA) publishing. It proposes an analysis framework of 18 core attributes, divided into the areas of bibliographic information, activity metrics, economics, accessibility, and predatory issues. The framework has been employed in a systematic analysis of 30 OA journals in software engineering (SE) and information systems (IS), which were selected from among 386 OA journals in Computer Science from the Directory of OA Journals. An analysis was performed on the sample of the journals, to provide an overview of the current situation of OA journals in the fields of SE and IS. The journals were then compared between-group, according to the presence of article processing charges. A within-group analysis was performed on the journals requesting article processing charges from authors, in order to understand what is the value added according to different price ranges. This article offers several contributions. It presents an overview of OA definitions and models. It provides an analysis framework born from the observation of data and the existing literature. It raises the need to study OA in the fields of SE and IS while offering a first analysis. Finally, it provides recommendations to readers of OA journals. This paper highlights several concerns still threatening the adoption of OA publishing in the fields of SE and IS. Among them, it is shown that high article processing charges are not sufficiently justified by the publishers, which often lack transparency and may prevent authors from adopting OA.

AB  - Scientific research activity is reaching a staggering growth rate, introducing new and compounding existing challenges regarding the quality of peer-review, rise of predatory journals, and larger issues involving academic integrity and fraud stemming from the increased pressure to publish. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is well-suited to address some of the challenges specific to scientific publishing. Companies including ARTiFACTS, Pluto, Orvium, and ScienceMatters-EUREKA, along with academic researchers, are exploring blockchain-based solutions to facilitate research data provenance and workflows, optimize the peer-review process, introduce better incentives, and even create new research journals and platforms utilizing blockchain. Building upon a review of these efforts, we propose a governance framework for scientific publishing based on a consortium blockchain model to create a more efficient means of navigating the publishing process. At the center of this framework is a model that adopts shared governance and validated inclusion via a Democratic Autonomous Organization (DAO). A DAO is an entity wherein the organizational rules are implemented and executed via smart contracts. The DAO will be comprised of participants of validated individuals and organizations who are publishers, editors, peer-reviewers, and citizen scientists to manage and oversee the framework. The framework also maps specifically to the publication workflow of submitting, handling, peer-review, and final editorial decision-making for scientific manuscripts. The goal of this framework is to increase transparency of scientific publishing, create a "pedigree" of a manuscript's research life cycle, and democratize the publication process while maintaining the accepted workflow common to scientific publishing by journals.

AB  - In November 2021, with the support of the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) and cOAlition S, four ‘task and finish’ working groups were established. The authors facilitated and supported these groups. Each group was responsible for producing tools that will enable library consortia and small independent publishers to negotiate transformative agreements, which is to say, agreements that will enable the publisher to fully transition to open access. The first task and finish group developed shared principles for transformative agreements. The second developed a data template to enable smaller independent publishers to reach agreements with library consortia and libraries, while the third developed example licence agreements. These groups recognized that the implementation of a transformative agreement crosses a complex ecosystem of technology, processes, policies, automated functions and manual functions that relate to contract management, article submission and peer review, content hosting and dissemination as well as financial management. For this reason, a fourth group produced a workflow framework that describes the process in all its phases. The members of these four groups were volunteers from stakeholder communities including libraries, library consortia, smaller independent publishers and intermediaries. This article explains why these tools are needed and the process behind their creation. The authors have combined these tools into a freely available toolkit, available under a CC BY licence.

AB  - This paper examines the differences between the publication performance (PP) of the scientific research areas (SRAs) of the hard and soft sciences. Intrigued by the significant statistical difference between the average publication levels of researchers from the hard and soft SRAs, this paper addresses the factors influencing researchers' publication levels. The study uses an online survey to gather data from 663 researchers from 140 research centers. A comparison of the parsimony solutions for the hard and soft sciences shows only two common pathways, thus providing evidence of different sufficient condition sets for publication for the two SRAs. The global intermediate solutions account for over 85% of the study's outcome variable, with consistency levels of more than 75%. The results show differences in the sufficient condition sets for the two SRAs that may be attributed to the variations in their scientific conceptual frameworks and the research methods applied by each discipline. Notably, having tenure seems to make a difference.

AB  - For years, Amsterdam University Press (AUP) has been publishing books in open access (OA). It uses the OAPEN Library and the <em>Directory of Open Access Books</em> (DOAB) to actively disseminate and promote its peer-reviewed OA monographs. The OAPEN Library targets both individual readers and academic libraries. On top of that, books with a 'free to read' licence are further promoted via DOAB. AUP also co-operates with the IMISCOE research networks to promote their books. While the online usage of OA books is rising, AUP has not found evidence that open access harms sales of printed editions.

AB  - When I hear the phrase "artificial intelligence" (AI), immediately my mind goes to robots and self-driving cars and rovers used for space exploration.In other words, I associate AI with complicated tasks that impact only a few of us.But the reality is that AI is everywhere around us, in ways that we might not even realize.We use digital assistants like Siri and Alexa to help us answer questions, make purchases for us, even to make us laugh (my daughters taught me that Alexa tells jokes).And who hasn't used Waze or Google Maps to get from point A to B? Or how about the social media we engage in daily and the content we are served on those platforms?Even autocorrect on our phones and in our word-processing documents are examples of AI.Thanks to the advancement of data collection and analysis, ever-faster computer processing, and the expansion of connected devices, nearly every industry has been impacted by AI in the past several years.For example, there has been the growth of autonomous cars in transportation, the use of robots working alongside humans in manufacturing, the advancement of diagnosing disease through machine-read imaging, and the automation of reporting and processes in finance (1).The scientific research enterprise is no different.

AB  - Although digitalization and the emergence of the Internet has caused a long-term crisis for copyright law, technology itself also seems to offer a seemingly ideal solution to the challenges of digital age: copyright has been a major use case for algorithmic enforcement from the early days of digital rights management technologies to the more advanced content recognition algorithms. These technologies identify and filter possibly infringing content automatically, effectively and often in a preventive fashion. These methods have been criticized for their shortcomings, such as the lack of transparency, bias and the possible impairment of fundamental rights. Self-learning machines and semi-autonomous AI have the potential to offer even more sophisticated and expeditious enforcement by code, however, they could also aggravate the aforementioned issues. As the EU legislator envisions to make the use of such technologies essentially obligatory for certain online content sharing service providers (via the infamous Article 17 of the directive on copyright in the digital single market), the assessment of the situation in light of future technological development has become a current topic.This paper aims to identify the main issues and potential long-term consequences of creating legislation that practically requires the employment of such filtering algorithms as well as their solutions. This paper focuses on the potential role a broad copyright exception for text and data mining could play in counterbalancing the issues associated with algorithmic enforcement.

AB  - This article presents an overview of a strategic partnership undertaken by the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) and the Érudit Consortium (Érudit) to support the move towards open access for Canadian francophone scholarly journals. CRKN and Érudit have had a relationship through a traditional commercial subscription model since 2008. In 2014, the two organizations recognized the need for a new relationship that would address two major challenges: the fragility of the Canadian not-for-profit scholarly publishing environment and the increasing pressure from libraries and funding agencies for scholarly journals to move towards open access. Érudit and CRKN have worked collaboratively to create an innovative partnership, which provides a framework for a new relationship between publishers and libraries, and helps to provide financial support to Canadian publishers during the transition to a fully open access model. This paper presents the perspectives of the two organizations involved in the partnership by outlining the common goals, objectives, and strategy, as well as the differing needs and perspectives of libraries and publishers. It summarizes the key aspects of the partnership as well as the challenges faced. Through this case study, the authors demonstrate how university libraries can play an active role in working with journals to support open access to research.&nbsp

TI  - Alignment of Top‐Down Policies With Emerging Bottom‐Up Practices: A Commentary on “(Why) Are Open Research Practices the Future for the Study of Language Learning?”
IS  - S2
VL  - 73
AU  - Laakso, Mikael
C1  - Hanken School of Economics, Finland
AB  - In their article, Marsden and Morgan-Short comprehensively review the current state and development trajectories for key areas within open research practices, both in general as well as more particularly in the context of language sciences. As the article reveals, the scope of open research practices is enormous and essentially touches upon every aspect of performing and interacting with research. The authors touch upon the lack of an established metascience within language sciences that would help inform and guide development of research practices, but, as I see it, the problem is universal, and there would be benefit in creating a stronger and more cohesive metascience discipline in general. While researchers have established practices of research, education, and dedicated scholarly communication outlets within the philosophy of science, history of science, information science, and higher education policy, metascience has remained an area where the discussion is highly distributed and appears sporadically across diverse research disciplines. As Marsden and Morgan-Short's review demonstrates, there are a lot of open questions relating to how to move forward on a global scale in the best interest of research and researchers. A more cohesive core of metascience would aid in the creation of immediately useful knowledge. One key perspective I would like to put forward to facilitate further structured reflection on the complex challenges surrounding open research practices in language sciences as well as in other disciplines is that of alignment seeking between top-down policies (e.g., mandates by funders or institutions for making publications or data open, institutional involvement in research infrastructures) and bottom-up practices (researchers taking particular practices into use by themselves, driven primarily by intrinsic motivation). Researchers in general have a lot of autonomy within their work, an aspect which creates a unique environment for the creation and wider adoption of new practices. The initial spark for many (I dare say most) open research practices and services for operating them have often been spawned as researcher-driven initiatives, for example, IRIS (Marsden & Mackey, 2014) and OASIS (Marsden et al., 2018) for research in language learning, without top-down requirement or enforcement. Today science policy, particularly within the European Union, is heavily influencing the uptake of open research practices by introducing requirements and monitoring for their compliance both through the open science requirements stated in the grant agreements of their own research funding instruments but also more generally for member countries to implement and report back on. However, if the requirements given top down are experienced as irrelevant and disconnected from the research context as seen by researchers, there is risk of alienation and a negative outcome for adoption (Lilja, 2020). Alignment of policy and practice in the context of open research practices is no easy challenge—balancing variables such as timing, sensitivity to the needs of individual research disciplines, research assessment, technological maturity, and practical feasibility runs the risk of friction in many regards. Even though challenging, alignment is necessary to smoothly scale useful new practices beyond the pioneering early adopters who take them into use in a bottom-up way. While the democratization of research that the internet has enabled has been a strong positive force for spurring innovation in the space of open research practices, the distributed nature of the environment introduces new threats to the scholarly record. The risk of open research initiatives being held up by solely volunteer effort without robust organizational backing can be very destructive as it could mean that valuable scholarly resources vanish, as has been the case, for example, for hundreds of open access scholarly journals (Laakso et al., 2021). Once new practices gain momentum it would be wise for institutions and policymakers to meet the research community halfway, that is, to align and to facilitate the creation of robustness to otherwise vulnerable services. One should not require or mandate practices that do not yet exist or have demonstrated potential, but if those leading in the field wait too long or support the wrong action or actors, this can lead to loss of momentum or even worse. In the case of IRIS and OASIS, this concern has been exemplarily catered to through early involvement of institutional support from both research performing as well as research funding organizations. What could then help aid alignment of policy and practice where circumstances are currently not yet so optimal for open research practices? Marsden and Morgan-Short highlighted that changes in research assessment have the potential to substantially alleviate some of the adoption challenges that open research practices have faced. This is a persistently recurring theme in panel discussions on open research practices in which I have been involved for over the last decade: Without change in assessment, researchers will never get anywhere regardless of what is built and recommended to be used. Change in research assessment was also singled out as the most substantial obstacle for change in scholarly publishing and scholarly communication in the final report of a recent expert group of which I was part (European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, 2019). Despite the buzz around the San Franscisco Declaration of Research Assessment, it is still common for institutions to lack integration of open research practices as part of research assessment (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2023). One issue has been the lack of taking tangible steps to fundamentally changing practices rather than just signaling support towards the greater cause of diversification in research assessment. The recently launched Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (2022) seeks organizational signatories to commit to and follow up the development of their assessment practices. It remains to be seen what effect this substantial new initiative will have on the landscape, but it carries the potential to help with the alignment of policy and practice in a way that the Declaration of Research Assessment has not done beyond initiating a very important discussion and creating a general direction among stakeholders. Researchers as highly autonomous actors need to perceive tangible use and acknowledgement of investing their time and effort into open research practices, otherwise these practices run the risk of never reaching their full potential in improving the research system.

AB  - This article presents a new framework for realizing the value of linked data understood as a strategic asset and increasingly necessary form of infrastructure for policy-making and research in many domains. We outline a framework, the 'data mosaic' approach, which combines socio-organizational and technical aspects. After demonstrating the value of linked data, we highlight key concepts and dangers for community-developed data infrastructures. We concretize the framework in the context of work on science and innovation generally. Next we consider how a new partnership to link federal survey data, university data, and a range of public and proprietary data represents a concrete step toward building and sustaining a valuable data mosaic. We discuss technical issues surrounding linked data but emphasize that linking data involves addressing the varied concerns of wide-ranging data holders, including privacy, confidentiality, and security, as well as ensuring that all parties receive value from participating. The core of successful data mosaic projects, we contend, is as much institutional and organizational as it is technical. As such, sustained efforts to fully engage and develop diverse, innovative communities are essential.

AB  - I recently revisited an insightful piece of writing that got me thinking.This article talks about how even though the peer review process underlies all of science, it is understudied and its defects are more prominent than its merits.This article also mentions how peer review is often famously compared with democracy-as "a system full of problems but the least bad we have". [1]This piece was published in 2006.Today, over 15 years later, peer review continues to occupy an important place in research, especially in grant funding and journal publishing.][5] While there are several published works that delve into the workings of the peer review process, its challenges, advantages, and demerits, two global events that have opened up unlimited conversations about peer review among the scholarly publishing community are the International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication [6] and Peer Review Week. [7]If you are unfamiliar with these events, here's a quick primer.

AB  - Abstract Open Access Engineering Journal PublishingThe scholarly publishing landscape is shifting. The emergence of open access, content that isonline and freely accessible, is challenging the traditional subscription publishing model. It isestimated that global open access journal publishing is now 12% overall. This study examinesopen access journal publishing within engineering to quantify and identify sources. Anunderstanding of current open access publishing within engineering can support scholarlycommunication initiatives and outreach efforts (e.g., finding faculty champions, promotion ofspecific venues, and determining financial funding levels). Using Web of Science, journalarticles within the 14 engineering Web of Science Categories were identified. The articles werecategorized based on open access, subject, author affiliation, and source title. Approximately 4%of the engineering journal articles within those 14 categories are open access, but limiting toinclude at least one U.S. author or coauthor decreased the number of open access articles to 1%.Comparisons were made between overall open access journal article publishing at the top 25 U.Sengineering schools and the percentage of open access engineering journal articles at thoseinstitutions. Despite overall open access publishing at the top 25 U.S. engineering schoolsapproaching the overall global open access journal publishing level (approximately 8%), openaccess engineering journal publishing is considerably less. A list of the most frequent openaccess engineering journal venues for the engineering schools is presented. The paper concludeswith a local study involving open access journal publishing within three engineering departmentsat a large research university, which reveals several interesting open access publishing patterns.

AB  - The study documents the growth in the number of journals and articles along with the increase in normalized citation rates of open access (OA) journals listed in the Scopus bibliographic database between 1999 and 2010. Longitudinal statistics on growth in journals/articles and citation rates are broken down by funding model, discipline, and whether the journal was launched or had converted to OA. The data were retrieved from the websites of SCIMago Journal and Country Rank (journal/article counts), JournalM3trics (SNIP2 values), Scopus (journal discipline) and Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) (OA and funding status). OA journals/articles have grown much faster than subscription journals but still make up less that 12% of the journals in Scopus. Two-year citation averages for journals funded by Article Processing Charges (APCs) have reached the same level as subscription journals. Citation averages of OA journals funded by other means continue to lag well behind OA journals funded by APCs and subscription journals. We hypothesize this is less an issue of quality than due to the fact that such journals are commonly published in languages other than English and tend to be located outside the four major publishing countries.

AB  - As libraries continue to increase the amount of content purchased in electronic format, the convention of signing a license agreement for each electronic product has become overly burdensome for both libraries and publishers. The delays inherent in this process have also created barriers to access for patrons. The NISO Shared E-Resource Understanding (SERU) working group was formed in 2006 to develop a best practices alternative that will allow libraries and publishers to avoid licenses for some types of electronic resources by agreeing to the “Statements of Common Understandings for Subscribing to Electronic Resources” outlined on the NISO web site (http://www.niso.org/committees/SERU). This report summarizes the history of the project and outlines next steps for libraries and publishers.

AB  - The quality and impact of scholarly articles are traditionally evaluated using metrics that put citation counts at the center. In the era of digitization, advanced online platforms and social media have transformed the dissemination of scientific information results and introduced new metrics for evaluating the influence of scholarly outputs and planning research studies. Alternative metrics (altmetrics) have emerged as tools for immediate measuring of scholarly outputs upon their online publication and dissemination through numerous online platforms, including social media channels. The Altmetrtic Attention Score by Altmetric.com has gained its global importance as an integral indicator for evaluation of constantly changing societal influence of individual articles. To a large extent, this and other social media metrics complement established citation metrics, allowing to visualize and predict implications at early stages of post-publication promotion. This article overviews characterstics of various altmetric tools and their growing roles for planning and evaluating scientific research.

AB  - More than 250 authors at Utah State University published an Open Access (OA) article in 2016. Analysis of survey results and publication data from Scopus suggests that the following factors led authors to choose OA venues: ability to pay publishing charges, disciplinary colleagues' positive attitudes toward OA, and personal feelings such as altruism and desire to reach a wide audience. Tenure status was not an apparent factor. This article adds to the body of literature on author motivations and can inform library outreach and marketing efforts, the creation of new publishing models, and the conversation about the larger scholarly publishing landscape.

AU  - Tomlin, Patrick
C1  - Virginia Tech University
AB  - Recent events suggest that open access has gained new momentum in the humanities, but the slow and uneven development of open-access initiatives in humanist fields continues to hinder the consolidation of efforts across the university. Although various studies have traced the general origins of the humanities’ reticence to embrace open access, few have actually considered the scholarly practices and disciplinary priorities that shape a discipline’s adoption of its principles. This article examines the emergence, potential and actualized, of open access in art history. Part case study, part conceptual mapping, the discussion is framed within the context of three interlocking dynamics: the present state of academic publishing in art history; the dominance of the journal and self-archiving repository within open-access models of scholarly production; and the unique roles played by copyright and permissions in art historical scholarship. It is hoped that tracing the discipline-specific configuration of research provides a first step toward both investigating the identity that open access might assume within the humanities, from discipline to discipline, and explaining how and why it might allow scholars to better serve themselves and their audiences.&#x0D; &#x0D;

AB  - Small academic publishers are commonly associated with universities, learned societies, or scientific groups with shared research agendas, differing from their larger commercial counterparts. This research explores specific bibliometric data to highlight differences and similarities of citation coverage for small journals indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The paper looks at small journals in open access format in comparison to larger, non-open access journals. The goal is to problematize and assess the visibility and impact of the literature being cited in indexed and non-indexed journals and discuss the role of small open access journals as bridges for field-specific (usually non-indexed) and highly cited (mostly indexed) literature in these databases. This approach sheds light into the scholarly, publishing practices of different academic fields and disciplines.

AB  - There is a driving imperative for new knowledge, approaches and technologies to empower scholarship, especially in emerging areas of inquiry. Sources of information now extend beyond the written word to include a wide range of born-digital objects. This paper examines the changing landscape in which digital scholars find, collaborate, create and process information and, as a result, scholarship is being transformed. It discusses the key elements required to build an institutional infrastructure, which will not only support new practices but also integrate scholarly literature into emerging and evolving models that generate true digital scholarship. The paper outlines some of the major impediments in implementing such a model, as well as suggestions on how to overcome these barriers.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to show that the journal impact factor (IF) is not able to reflect the full impact of scholarly journals and provides an overview of alternative and complementary methods in journal evaluation. Design/methodology/approach – Aslib Proceedings (AP) is exemplarily analyzed with a set of indicators from five dimensions of journal evaluation, i.e. journal output, content, perception and usage, citations and management to accurately reflect its various strengths and weaknesses beyond the IF. Findings – AP has become more international in terms of authors and more diverse regarding its topics. Citation impact is generally low and, with the exception of a special issue on blogs, remains world average. However, an evaluation of downloads and Mendeley readers reveals that the journal is an important source of information for professionals and students and certain topics are frequently read but not cited. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited to one journal. Practical implications – An overview of various indicators and methods is provided that can be applied in the quantitative evaluation of scholarly journals (and also to articles, authors and institutions). Originality/value – After a publication history of more than 60 years, this analysis takes stock of AP, highlighting strengths and weaknesses and developments over time. The case study provides an example and overview of the possibilities of multidimensional journal evaluation.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the history of KU ScholarWorks, the University of Kansas' institutional repository, and the various strategies used to promote and populate it. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes how KU ScholarWorks came into being, and discusses the variety of activities employed to publicize the repository and encourage faculty to deposit their work. In addition, the paper discusses some of the concerns expressed by faculty members, and some of the obstacles encountered in getting them to use the repository. The paper concludes with some observations about KU's efforts, an assessment of the success of the program to date, and suggests some next steps the program may take. Findings The paper found that KU ScholarWorks has relied on a “self‐archiving” model, which requires regular communication with faculty and long‐term community building. Repository content continues to grow at a steady pace, but uptake among faculty has been slow. In the absence of mandates requiring faculty to deposit work, organizations running institutional repositories must continue to aggressively pursue a variety of strategies to promote repositories to faculty and encourage them to deposit their scholarship. Originality/value KU's experience will help other institutions develop institutional repositories by providing examples of marketing strategies, and by promoting a greater understanding of faculty behavior and concerns with regard to institutional repositories.

AB  - Metadata harvesting requires timely propagation of up-to-date information from thousands of repositories over a wide area network. It is desirable to keep the data as fresh as possible while observing the overhead on the harvester. An important dimension to be considered is that repositories vary widely in their update patterns; they may experience different update rates at different times or unexpected changes to update patterns. In this paper, we define data freshness metrics and propose an adaptive algorithm for the synchronization of the harvester with the repositories. The algorithm is based on meeting a desired level of freshness while incurring the minimum overhead on the harvester. We present a comparison between different policies for the synchronization within the framework devised. It is shown that the proposed policy outperform the other policies, especially for heterogeneous update patterns.

AB  - The commitment to Open Access (OA) movement has started revolutionising the outline of conventional scholarly publishing practices and welcoming the new wind to scientific research across the world. Motivating by the changing scenario, the study strives to analyse OA uptake by the Indian academic and research institutions concerning their research productivity. Publication data of 36 universities have been retrieved from the 2020 record of CWTS Leiden Ranking database. Findings of the study show that around 23 per cent of all publications of these universities are openly accessible, and their median OA publications proportion is much lower (around half) than the median measure of universities worldwide (43 %). ‘Green OA’ reserved the first place with 17 per cent of occurrence, and Biomedical and Health Sciences have achieved the highest median (34.37 %). The study concludes with a vision towards increasing the global collaboration of the academic institutions regarding OA following the account of the Indian achievements.

AB  - Background: Although Turkey publishes more than 3000 peer-reviewed scientific journals, fewer than 5% of them are covered by major indexing databases, and only 1 of the 10 scientific journals published by Trakya University (Turkey) is among those quality journals. In November 2017, Trakya University organized a workshop titled &amp;lsquo;Increasing the quality of academic journals at Trakya University&amp;rsquo;, the ultimate goal of which was to bring together all stakeholders in the process of academic publishing, to review the criteria of publishing quality, and to recommend measures to enhance the quality of academic journals published from Turkey.&amp;nbsp; Objectives: To review the current status of academic journals published by Trakya University in terms of international publishing standards, to devise measures to enhance their quality, and also to help other journals do the same.&amp;nbsp; Methods: Information was collected from the websites of 10 academic journals pub-lished by Trakya University in the fields of natural, medical, and social sciences to assess the extent to which each journal met a set of criteria defining quality academic publishing. These journals were then compared in terms of their success in meeting those criteria. Results: No single measure can improve the quality of all the ten journals published by Trakya University. Balkan Medical Journal topped the list in that it satisfied nearly all the criteria whereas the journals that met the fewest criteria were Trakya University Journal of Economics and Administrative Sciences Faculty, Trakya University Journal of Faculty of Letters , and Journal of Balkan Libraries Union . Timeliness in ensuring ethical standards was the criterion most often met by the journals, but all 10 failed to meet the criteria related to data accessibility and good reporting guidelines. Of the 8 crite-ria related to fairness of the blind-review processes, all 10 met 6 but none met all 8. In terms of transparency and implementation of best practices, the highest compliance was in terms of the criteria related to the name of the journal, its governing body, and archiving, but no journal made any effort to market itself, that is, to expand its circulation. Conclusions: The strengths and weaknesses of each journal with reference to the quality of academic publishing were highlighted. The method described in the paper can also be used for evaluating other journals.

AB  - Understanding a country's scientific situation is essential for any country. Common indicators for measuring a country's scientific capability are the number of publications and citations. In this study, we design a new method, the citation induced scientific capability identification (CISCI) method, to measure a country's scientific capability from the perspective of the scientific roles the country undertakes in scientific research. Then, we employ this method to analyze countries' scientific capability based on downloaded citation data in the field of economics and business. Finally, we check the applicability of our designed method and explore countries' scientific capability in the accounting and physics disciplines. The results show that the scientific capability of 158 countries has been changing for many years. Every country has different scientific capabilities in different scientific roles, and China's scientific capability has improved dramatically. The CISCI method is applicable for analyzing scientific capability in scientific research.

AB  - Federal funding agencies in the United States (U.S.) continue to work towards implementing their plans to increase public access to funded research and comply with the 2013 Office of Science and Technology memo Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research. In this article we report on an analysis of research data sharing policy documents from 17 U.S. federal funding agencies as of February 2021. Our analysis is guided by two questions: 1.) What do the findings suggest about the current state of and trends in U.S. federal funding agency data sharing requirements? 2.) In what ways are universities, institutions, associations, and researchers affected by and responding to these policies? Over the past five years, policy updates were common among these agencies and several themes have been thoroughly developed in that time; however, uncertainty remains around how funded researchers are expected to satisfy these policy requirements.

AB  - In an effort to understand trends in open and distance education more comprehensively, this study aims to identify the research trends, major concepts, and cutoff points in the articles published between 2009 and 2016. From five major peer-reviewed journals, a total of 989 articles were analyzed through a systematic literature review process using content analysis. The articles were coded based on the following three categories: level, topics, and sub-topics. The results indicated the followings: (1) emerged main themes in the articles were foundations of open and distance education, instructional process, and effects of applications; (2) there was an upward growth in the publishing of the articles on massive open online courses, open educational resources, and students’ perspectives; (3) new pedagogical approaches and online learning design played a triggering role in the research topics; and (4) technological and pedagogical developments between 2011 and 2012 had an influence on the tendency of the articles. In addition, we explored cutoff points so that they may provide insights and valuable hints for researchers to design new studies in open and distance education field. Discussions about the gaps in the state-of-the-art trends and directions about future research were also included.

AB  - This paper reports on the outcomes of research assessing the nature and extent of print journal cancellations by Australian research libraries since 1990. The cancellation activity of two groups of libraries, one representing the national and state library sector and the other the university library sector, was examined. These two groups were tested for their cancellation of both Australian and international journals. From the results some conclusions are reached about the factors driving the cancellations and the implications these cancellations might have for the nation’s access to scholarly journal literature.

AB  - The introduction of the internet has revolutionized the dissemination and assessment of research outputs with renewed emphasis on the impact of scholarly publications. The purpose of this study was to measure scholarly presence and citation impact of research scientists of the Building and Road Research Institute (CSIR-BRRI) on the internet. Bibliometrics was employed as a quantitative research method for this study using Google Scholar. The results showed that majority (77.5%) of scientists had at least one scholarly reference on the internet. It also found that, almost all (96.5%) scientists who had scholarly works online showed affiliation to the CSIR-BRRI. Again, it was observed that most mentions/hits were journal publications (59%) followed by thesis (35%). However, the study found that there was a weak positive relationship between number of journal articles and citations online, a clear indication that a web presence does not automatically reflect the usefulness of a scholarly output. It is recommended that scientists identify and research into globally relevant topics and also publish in reputable journals to enhance their visibility.

AB  - Scientific journals play an important role in academic information exchange and their assessment is of interest to science authorities, editors and researchers. The assessment of journals is of particular interest to South African authorities as the country’s universities are partially funded according to the number of publications they produce in accredited journals, such as the Thomson Reuters indexed journals. Scientific publishing in South Africa has experienced a revolution during the last 10 years. Our objective here is to report the performance of the country’s journals during 2009 and 2010 according to a number of metrics (i.e. impact factors, Eigenfactors® and the international character of editorial boards); to identify and compare the impact of the South African journals that have been recently added to the Thomson Reuters' Journal Citation Reports®; and to elaborate on issues related to science policy.

AB  - Open access (OA) is a revolutionary way of providing access to the scholarly journal literature made possible by the Internet. The primary aim of this study was to measure the volume of scientific articles published in full immediate OA journals from 2000 to 2011, while observing longitudinal internal shifts in the structure of OA publishing concerning revenue models, publisher types and relative distribution among scientific disciplines. The secondary aim was to measure the share of OA articles of all journal articles, including articles made OA by publishers with a delay and individual author-paid OA articles in subscription journals (hybrid OA), as these subsets of OA publishing have mostly been ignored in previous studies.Stratified random sampling of journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals (n = 787) was performed. The annual publication volumes spanning 2000 to 2011 were retrieved from major publication indexes and through manual data collection.An estimated 340,000 articles were published by 6,713 full immediate OA journals during 2011. OA journals requiring article-processing charges have become increasingly common, publishing 166,700 articles in 2011 (49% of all OA articles). This growth is related to the growth of commercial publishers, who, despite only a marginal presence a decade ago, have grown to become key actors on the OA scene, responsible for 120,000 of the articles published in 2011. Publication volume has grown within all major scientific disciplines, however, biomedicine has seen a particularly rapid 16-fold growth between 2000 (7,400 articles) and 2011 (120,900 articles). Over the past decade, OA journal publishing has steadily increased its relative share of all scholarly journal articles by about 1% annually. Approximately 17% of the 1.66 million articles published during 2011 and indexed in the most comprehensive article-level index of scholarly articles (Scopus) are available OA through journal publishers, most articles immediately (12%) but some within 12 months of publication (5%).OA journal publishing is disrupting the dominant subscription-based model of scientific publishing, having rapidly grown in relative annual share of published journal articles during the last decade.

Widely viewed as the “gold standard,” it is considered a requirement for affirming validity and quality, as well as for codifying disciplinary boundaries. As journal editor Richard Smith vividly recalled: “It is the method by which grants are allocated, papers published, academics promoted, and Nobel prizes won. … When something is peer reviewed it is in some sense blessed.”

AB  - Predatory journals have arisen as a significant problem within scholarly literature and efforts to raise awareness about them have focused on researchers looking to publish their work. Because health professionals use scholarly literature to inform their practice, develop policy, and conduct their own research, they should be familiar with the harmfulness of predatory journals. This paper describes an education session delivered to health professionals throughout the province of X. Developed in response to health professionals’ low awareness of predatory journals, it was designed to raise awareness and to provide tools and techniques to critically appraise the scholarly literature.

TI  - A New Method and Metric to Evaluate the Peer Review Process of Scholarly Journals
IS  - 1
VL  - 30
AU  - Etkin, Adam
C1  - (Pace University)
AB  - This paper will propose a new system that produces a metric that is an indicator of the level of peer review conducted prior to the publication of scholarly material. A mathematical algorithm which incorporates weighted values of the roles within the peer review process is created. The h-index, which is a value that "measures the productivity and impact of a scientist or scholar," is also incorporated. Each round of review is weighted using the square root as later rounds of peer review are often less rigorous than earlier rounds. Once a paper is accepted the calculation is conducted and a "peer review evaluation" metric, or "Peer Review Evaluation Score" (pre-SCORE) is available. It is clear that such a metric would prove beneficial to all engaged parties (authors, publishers, readers, libraries). Authors will know that their work is being evaluated by a trustworthy publication and by experts in their field. Legitimate, ethical publishers will be recognized as such. Readers would have the ability to filter out material which was not properly vetted, and libraries/consortia would have further assurance that their limited funds are spent wisely. Future studies to see if there is a correlation between the pre-SCORE and Impact Factor or highly cited material is possible. The proposed metric would be one more tool available to aid in the discovery of quality published research.

AB  - This paper investigates the use of traditional and altmetrics indicators to present a comprehensive study on the evaluation of academic monographs in the field of library and information studies. The research analyzes a dataset of 116 monographs published in the last five years, which are obtained from the Dimensions platform. Traditional citation counts were extracted from Dimensions, whereas altmetrics indicators were collected using API from Altmetric.com. This study investigates the relationship between traditional and altmetrics indicators and finds that altmetrics indicators measure the social impact of monographs, whereas traditional citation indicators measure the academic impact. Moreover, the study reveals that open access (OA) books are more likely to attract altmetrics indicators. This research demonstrates that altmetrics indicators can act as an insightful supplement to traditional citation-based indicators for evaluating academic monographs and further highlights the significance of the Dimensions platform for conducting academic book evaluations. Furthermore, this study provides empirical evidence on the complementarity of traditional and altmetrics indicators in evaluating academic monographs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This exploratory study was intended to shed light on Canadian academics’ participation in, knowledge of and attitudes towards Open Access (OA) journal publishing. The primary aim of the study was to inform the authors’ schools’ educational and outreach efforts to faculty regarding OA publishing. The survey was conducted at two Canadian comprehensive universities: Brock University (St. Catharines, Ontario) and Wilfrid Laurier University (Waterloo, Ontario) in 2014. METHODS: A Web-based survey was distributed to faculty at each university. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. LIMITATIONS: Despite the excellent response rates, the results are not generalizable beyond these two institutions. RESULTS: The Brock response rate was 38 percent; the Laurier response rate was 23 percent from full-time faculty and five percent from part-time faculty. Brock and Laurier faculty members share common characteristics in both their publishing practices and attitudes towards OA. Science/health science researchers were the most positive about OA journal publishing; arts and humanities and social sciences respondents were more mixed in their perceptions; business participants were the least positive. Their concerns focused on OA journal quality and associated costs. CONCLUSION: While most survey respondents agreed that publicly available research is generally a good thing, this study has clearly identified obstacles that prevent faculty’s positive attitudes towards OA from translating into open publishing practices.&#x0D; INTRODUCTION : Cette étude exploratoire tente de mieux comprendre la participation, les connaissances et les attitudes des universitaires canadiens envers la publication en libre accès. Le but premier de cette étude est d’éclairer les campagnes éducatives et de sensibilisation concernant la publication en libre accès auprès des institutions des auteurs. Un sondage a été mené en 2014 à deux universités à vocation générale canadiennes : Brock University (St. Catherine, Ontario) et Wilfrid Laurier University (Waterloo, Ontario). MÉTHODES : Un sondage en ligne a été envoyé au corps professoral de chaque université. Les données ont été analysées à l’aide de statistiques descriptives. LIMITES : Malgré l’excellent taux de réponse, les résultats ne peuvent être généralisés au-delà des deux universités. RÉSULTATS : Le taux de réponse de Brock était de 38%; celui de Laurier était de 23% pour les professeurs à temps plein et 5% pour les professeurs à temps partiel. Les professeurs des deux universités partagent quelques caractéristiques quant à leurs pratiques et attitudes envers le libre accès. Les chercheurs en médecine et en sciences de la santé étaient les plus positifs envers la publication dans des revues en libre accès; les répondants des arts, sciences humaines et sciences sociales avaient des opinions mixtes; les participants en gestion étaient les moins positifs. Leurs inquiétudes portaient sur la qualité des revues en libre accès et les coûts associés. CONCLUSION : Malgré le fait que la plupart des répondants croient qu’il est bon que la recherche soit disponible au grand public, cette étude identifie clairement des obstacles qui empêchent les professeurs de passer d’attitudes positives envers le libre accès à des pratiques concrètes de publication ouverte.

AB  - Abstract The Metadata 2020 initiative is an ongoing effort to bring various scholarly communications stakeholder groups together to promote principles and standards of practice to improve the quality of metadata. To understand the perspectives and practices regarding metadata of the main stakeholder groups (librarians, publishers, researchers, and repository managers), we conducted a survey during summer 2019. The survey content was generated by representatives from the stakeholder groups. A link to an online survey (17 or 18 questions depending on the group) was distributed through multiple social media, listserv, and blog outlets. Responses were anonymous, with an optional entry for names and email addresses for those who were willing to be contacted later. Complete responses (N = 211; 87 librarians, 27 publishers, 48 repository managers, and 49 researchers) representing 23 countries on four continents were analyzed and summarized for thematic content and ranking of awareness and practices. Across the stakeholder groups, the level of awareness and usage of metadata methods and practices was highly variable. Clear gaps across the groups point to the need for consolidation of schema and practices, as well as broad educational efforts to increase knowledge and implementation of metadata in scholarly communications.

AB  - EDITOR'S SUMMARY While the conventions of bibliographic citation have been long established, the sole focus is on reference to other scholarly works. Access to the data serving as the basis for scholarly work has been limited. Data citation extends important access to material that has been largely unavailable for sharing, verification and reuse. The Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles, finalized in February 2014, is a formal statement pulling together practices used in the research and publishing arenas and in common use. The declaration encompasses eight principles that stress the importance and legitimacy of data, the need to give scholarly credit to contributors and the importance of data as evidence. Cited data should have unique and persistent identifiers, and the citation should facilitate human and machine access and support verification and interoperability. The principles are expected to have broad impact on research, recognition and scholarly publishing.

AB  - An Investigative Analysis on the Utilization of the Essential Electronic Agricultural Library (TEEAL) by Researchers: A Case Study of National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM) Library. Oyeniyi J. Oluwakemi; Olaifa Taye Paul; Uzokwe Chuka Christian; Alu Fredrick; Oyewopo Adewale Oyekunle Abstract This research work seeks to investigate the rate of utilization of electronic library and in particular, The Essential Electronic Agricultural Library (TEEAL) by researchers. While analysing the data in this research work, it was discovered that although 99% of the respondents have heard about TEEAL and the usefulness, only very few of the respondents actually utilize the electronic library. This poor utilization was however linked to several points such as poor power supply, inadequate computer systems in the library and limitations in the accessibility of the library due to working hours. The researchers of this work however discovered that researchers still prefer other means of sourcing research information such as Google search and periodicals, which can be easily accessed via the mobile telephone and related devices.

AB  - The Publisher Application System (PAS) is a Web-based archiving and online evaluation system developed by the Database Evaluation Group (DEG), one of the working groups formed within the Anatolian University Libraries Consortium (ANKOS). The DEG was formed in 2008 to inquire and evaluate e-resources suited to the needs of the consortium; to follow up similar consortial activities worldwide as well as developments in connection with the scientific publishing industry; and to determine, implement, and improve pricing models in accordance with the prevailing economic, legal, and academic system. Development of the PAS was essential to ensure standardization and sustainability towards a more detailed and effective analysis of e-resources qualifying for evaluation by ANKOS. The PAS played an important part not only in establishing and defining the workflow of the DEG, but also in creating an archive of both the e-resources submitted to the consortium and the applicant publishers/agents submitting these resources. This article outlines the process that started with the foundation of the DEG through the formation of the PAS as well as the present setup of the system. It is also hoped that this case study will have a positive contribution to the processes being followed by the persons and the groups engaged in similar activities.

C1  - OA Book Usage Data Trust
AB  - <p class="first" id="d19351620e56">Currently, individual publishers, librarians, scholarly publishing platforms and services encounter challenges when collecting the OA book usage data to make strategic decisions about their OA publishing and OA programs. Staff time and expertise is required to normalize and aggregate these impact metrics from numerous platforms. Without such high-quality, reliable data available, organizations cannot be fully aware of the context-specific impacts related to a given author, collection, institution or platform. Additionally, smaller organizations often lack the resources to process incoming usage data and benefit from such OA impact analytics. To address this disparity, stakeholders have been advancing the Open Access Book Usage Data Trust effort (OAeBUDT) with support from the Mellon Foundation. This international network is working towards exchanging reliable usage data in a trusted, equitable, and community-governed way. By 2025, the effort aims to foster the secure, multi-party exchange, aggregation and benchmarking of book usage related data; increase trust in usage metrics; improve data quality; and reduce OA reporting and compliance resource-burdens. In 2023, the project is developing ethical data use guidelines to inform OA book usage data sharing agreements and technical requirements for data exchange between public and commercial OA book usage data creators. This poster will provide background to the OAeBUDT effort, summarizing key research findings to date while providing a preview of the emerging ethical data exchange and use guidelines. QR codes will be available for individuals to participate in open community consultations and download resources for later reference.

AB  - Much of the debate about open access has focused on the principle of access for scientists and the economics of such a change.There is a second principle to consider: the full power of new technological approaches such as text mining, collaborative filtering, and semantic indexing, are not resulting in powerful new public resources.Despite real success in the open access movement, most scholarly research is unavailable, either for study or for processing by software.According to the Budapest open access initiative, "There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature.By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited." 1 Open access journals are entering the mainstream of scholarly publishing. 2 The Directory of Open Access Journals (www.doaj.org), a listing of "free, full text, quality controlled scientific and scholarly journals," includes 2478 journals, with on average more than one journal a day added in 2006 (121 999 articles are tracked). 3Open access journals have earned top impact factors in fields such as biology and bioinformatics, 4 5 as well as high immediacy factors. 6ut most journals are non-open access.Many nonopen access journals and publishers tackle the access problem by allowing authors to post copies of their works on the internet; this is known as "self archiving."Self archiving by authors is also growing rapidly.Between March 2005 and October 2006, the number of institutional archives tracked at the Registry of Open Access Repositories (http://archives.eprints.org)has grown by nearly one every other day, and the number of records in those archives has grown by nearly 600%, to 1.2 million papers.Open access is here to stay, in one form or another.

AB  - In the last decade, scholarly graphs became fundamental to storing and managing scholarly knowledge in a structured and machine-readable way. Methods and tools for discovery and impact assessment of science rely on such graphs and their quality to serve scientists, policymakers, and publishers. Since research data became very important in scholarly communication, scholarly graphs started including dataset metadata and their relationships to publications. Such graphs are the foundations for Open Science investigations, data-article publishing workflows, discovery, and assessment indicators. However, due to the heterogeneity of practices (FAIRness is indeed in the making), they often lack the complete and reliable metadata necessary to perform accurate data analysis; e.g., dataset metadata is inaccurate, author names are not uniform, and the semantics of the relationships is unknown, ambiguous or incomplete. This work describes an open and curated scholarly graph we built and published as a training and test set for data discovery, data connection, author disambiguation, and link prediction tasks. Overall the graph contains 4,047 publications, 5,488 datasets, 22 software, 21,561 authors; 9,692 edges interconnect publications to datasets and software and are labeled with semantics that outline whether a publication is citing, referencing, documenting , supplementing another product. To ensure high-quality metadata and semantics, we relied on the information extracted from PDFs of the publications and the datasets and software webpages to curate and enrich nodes metadata and edges semantics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever published resource, including publications and datasets with manually validated and curated metadata.

AB  - This paper offers an overview of the highlights of the 2020 NISO Plus inaugural conference that was held in Baltimore, MD from February 23–February 25, 2020. This conference replaced what would have been the 62nd Annual NFAIS conference. However, NISO and NFAIS merged in June 2019, resulting in the conference being renamed NISO Plus and taking on a new format. The goal was to continue some of the best traditions of past NFAIS conferences while building in time for discussions. With two and a half days of networking and education on tap, attendees had the opportunity to learn about emerging and exciting areas of change and development such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and new content types such as Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality. There were very practical sessions that focused on the status of standards, current issues and problems, with the goal of working towards innovative solutions and developing plans for moving forward.

AB  - The economy of open access (OA) publishing has been a topic of intensive research over the last two decades. Dichotomies between the so-called 'green' and 'gold' models, or between fee-based and non-fee-based gold models, the latter known as the diamond model, have been addressed from diverse perspectives. However, some critical insights that would enable a thorough understanding of publishers’ and editors’ decision-making and provide a foundation for developing future evidence-based public policies are still missing.In recent years, more importance has been given to the diamond OA model, and the European research area has recognized its potential to bring change and possibly transform the scholarly publishing landscape. The 2021 EC-funded OA Diamond Journals Study (Bosman et al., 2021) reveals that while Europe is rich in OA Diamond journals, they are far from all being included in the DOAJ, nor are they equally distributed across scholarly disciplines and European regions. The study indicates the dominance of large commercial and APC-based publishers in Western Europe contrasted to the prevalence of smaller, diamond OA publishers in Central and Eastern Europe. Yet, subsequent research by Laakso and Multas (2023) shows that such a distribution across European regions could oversimplify a more diverse landscape. Their bibliometric-based analysis indicates that within regions, countries can vary significantly in their publishing ecosystems, based on several factors: the type (and size) of dominant publishers, the availability of country-level public funding mechanisms for scholarly journals, and the availability of common publishing infrastructures. There are examples of countries from different European regions that appear to be successful in building a thriving and sustainable national diamond publishing ecosystem. However, some publishers adopt an APC-based business model even in such predominantly diamond ecosystems. Our study will be twofold: a comparative investigation will establish the share of APC journals in several dominantly diamond countries: Croatia, Finland, France, Norway, Serbia, and Spain. Although limited in geographical scope, the intended sample will strive for complete coverage of OA journals: authors from each country will provide comprehensive national addenda to DOAJ lists. The publicly available information on the websites of all identified OA journals issued by the publishers located in the countries mentioned above will be inspected for evidence of APC schemes (any fees or charges required of authors or their institutions for submitting or publishing a paper in a journal). The study will address the following research questions: 1. What is the share of journals charging APCs at the time of research (among all OA journals in the country, and especially among journals receiving public subsidies, if there are such subsidies available)?; 2. What is the range, median and mode of APC costs?; 3. Is the existence of APCs and their cost related to the type of a journal publisher or owner, the scholarly discipline, or the fact that the journal is indexed inestablished international indices and databases?The insight into the incidence of APC-based journals and the context in which they are introduced will be complemented with a qualitative analysis of APC descriptions. This is expected to reveal some of the reasons for their introduction and possibly show that smaller publishers could resort to some local and nonstandard mechanisms. It will answer additional research questions: 4. Are there any specificities of the APC mechanisms among the analysed journals (waivers, discounts, membership fees, etc.)?, and 5. How transparent are journals about their APCs? (What are the terms used for APCs in different languages? Are they listed in their DOAJ records? Is it explained what they are charged for and how the funds are used?).The results are expected to deepen the existing knowledge about the diversity and sustainability of OA ecosystems.

AB  - The emergence and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, particularly text-based ones known as large language models, pose both opportunities and challenges to education. The ability of these tools to generate human-like texts based on minimal instructions causes concerns among educators about students’ use of these tools for academic writing, which may constitute a breach of academic integrity. We propose a pedagogical design that models on self-regulated learning and the authoring cycle and develops students’ critical thinking and self-regulation when composing academic writing using text-based generative AI tools. It contains six iterative and interactive phases. Students first plan the content and structure of the writing, then generate prompts for text-based generative AI tools. Next, students preview and verify the tools’ output, followed by the fourth phase of producing the writing using the corrected output. Fifthly, peer review by fellow students may be required to polish and proofread the writing. Lastly, through portfolio-tracking, students reflect on the writing process, and formulate strategies for future usage of text-based generative AI tools for writing. This pedagogical design helps students and teachers embrace text-based generative AI while addressing the perils these tools present, and guides the development of education interventions and instruments.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical framework and guidance, based on the authors’ local experience, for libraries investigating or in the early stages of planning to offer scholarly publishing services for journal literature. While the authors use a number of publishing tools and platforms at Penn State, based on the content and needs of the requester, here the focus is on a model of using Open Journal Systems for a range of needs from peer-reviewed scholarly journals to more informal publications such as student research. Design/methodology/approach – Penn State Libraries Publishing and Curation Services has been both defining the philosophy and building the mechanics for delivering a formal publishing services program for a variety of clients and formats. This article traces the authors’ journey as a facilitator within the research life cycle. Findings – The authors’ results from working with a range of clients show that there will need to be an equally varied range of publishing options to meet the expectations. A descriptive service template available in advance plus a flexible approach to implementation is the authors’solution. The authors use the concept of “tiers of service” where the Libraries and the journal proposers agree on roles and expectations as part of the negotiation and implementation processes. Such an approach allows for some creativity and also offers efficiency in dealing with the universal requirements for discoverability, appearance, workflow management and intellectual property oversight. Originality/value – The authors’ experience emphasizes the consultation and data gathering process, and its importance to a successful journal project collaboration.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution has paved the way for emerging technologies, and among them, blockchain stands out for its unprecedented ability to create and trade value in library organizations. This research paper explores the potential application of blockchain technologies in 21st-century library services. By conducting a systematic analysis of the literature, this study examines how libraries can harness blockchain to support innovative services and meet global demands. The study suggests that the recent advancements in blockchain have led to a fourth generation of the technology, which possesses disruptive capabilities across diverse fields, including library and information science. The paper proposes that blockchain can enhance library services such as collection development, circulation services, research, data management, and storage. It is important to note that this paper represents the original ideas of the authors and does not rely on copyrighted materials. Furthermore, it highlights that blockchain remains a vast and underexplored area of research, presenting both challenges and opportunities for library professionals seeking to provide diverse library services.

AB  - Trust is a core component of collaboration. Trust is a local phenomenon, and scientific research is a global collaborative, its impact multiplied through open exchange, communication and mobility of people and information. Given the diversity of participants, local policies and cultures, how can trust be established in and between research communities? You need transparent governance processes, thoughtful engagement of stakeholder groups, and open and durable information sharing to build the "stickiness" needed. In this paper we illustrate these concepts through three trust building use cases: ORCID, Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, and SeamlessAccess, platforms sharing an identity and access technical service core, painstaking community building, and transparent governance frameworks.

AB  - Activities scholars undertake to be viewed as productive and tenurable (publication in traditional media) are out of sync with the activities they must engage it to be well informed and well connected (participation in electronic communication forums). This work examines the challenges and provides a time line for the legitimization, codification, organization, and general maturation of electronic scholarly publishing. It is anticipated that the role of relatively unstructured, uncontrolled, and informal electronic scholarly communication will be of continued importance, yet will largely remain independent of efforts to create standards and protocols for electronic books, journals, and other transformed traditional media.

AB  - The data management plan (DMP), while seen by many as an ancillary document during a grant application, is a rich source of contextual information that is key to ensuring researchers, funders, and institutions follow the best possible and most appropriate research data management (RDM) practices. Unfortunately, the current practice is to transmit this information to the funder as a PDF or Word file through their web portals. As optimizing internal workflows and information sharing is a priority across the research space, retooling DMPs as machine-readable and machine-actionable will enable leveraging of key information to build RDM strategies collectively. Similarly, there is a growing need to streamline workflows, reuse information and reduce the burden on researchers.

AB  - Abstract A continued lack of clarity persists because academics, policymakers, and other interested parties are unable to clearly define what is a “predatory” journal or publisher, and a potentially wide gray zone exists there. In this perspective, we argue that journals should be evaluated on a continuum, and not just in two shades, black and white. Since evaluations about what might constitute “predatory” are made by humans, the psychological decision-making system that determines them may induce biases. Considering such human psychological characteristics might shed light on the deterministic criteria that have been used, and continue to be used, to classify a journal or publisher as “predatory”, and perhaps, bring additional clarity to this discussion. Better methods of journal evaluation can be obtained when the factors that polarize journal evaluations are identified. As one example, we need to move away from simply using whitelists and blacklists and educate individual researchers about how to evaluate journals. This paper serves as an educational tool by providing more clarity about the “gray” publishing zone, and argues that currently available qualitative and quantitative systems should be fused to deterministically appreciate the zonation of white, gray and black journals, so as to possibly reduce or eliminate the influence of cognitive or “perception” bias from the “predatory” publishing debate.

AB  - Predatory journals and publishers are a growing concern in the scholarly publishing arena. As one type of attempt to address this increasingly important issue, numerous individuals, associations, and companies have begun curating journal watchlists or journal safelists. This study uses a qualitative content analysis to explore the inclusion/exclusion criteria stated by scholarly publishing journal watchlists and safelists to better understand the content of these lists, as well as the larger controversies that continue to surround the phenomenon that has come to be known as predatory publishing. Four watchlists and ten safelists were analyzed through an examination of their published mission statements and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Notable differences that emerged include the remaining influence of librarian Jeffrey Beall in the watchlists, and the explicit disavowal of his methods for the safelists, along with a growing recognition that the “list” approach may not fully address systemic aspects of predatory publishing that go beyond the individual author's ethical decision-making agency.

AB  - Abstracts are essential components of academic research articles, providing a concise summary of the study's purpose, methods, results, and conclusions. This qualitative evidence synthesis examines the quality, structure, and content of abstracts in the fields of English Language Teaching (ELT) and Literature. A systematic search of relevant databases identified 15 peer-reviewed articles published in English with a focus on abstract writing. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the studies for their research findings, methodologies, and recommendations related to abstract writing. The findings reveal that abstracts tend to be descriptive, with a focus on presenting the research problem, methodology, and main findings. However, there is a lack of consistency in structure and content across journals, and the quality of abstracts varies widely. Based on the analysis, several key recommendations for improving abstract writing in ELT and Literature journals are proposed, including greater consistency and standardization across journals, and improved training for authors and reviewers. This qualitative evidence synthesis offers a thorough overview of the body of knowledge on the subject of writing effective abstracts for ELT and literature journals and makes suggestions for further study and practice in this field. The study highlights the need for greater attention to abstract writing quality, structure, and content, and provides practical recommendations for improving the quality of abstracts in ELT and Literature research articles using thematic analysis as a data analysis technique.

AB  - This study aims to reveal the essence a group of health sciences academics’ experience in producing scholarly publications.&#x0D; In this study conducted with the qualitative phenomenological approach, a set of predetermined criteria were used to select the participants for inclusion in the study group. Thus, the criterion-based sampling method, one of the purposive sampling methods, was used in this study. A semi-structured interview form prepared by the researchers was used as a data collection tool. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with the participants. Upon observing data saturation, the data collection process was ended. 12 academics were included in this study. After the interview records were transcribed by the researchers, they were all transferred to the MAXQDA 2022 program, through which coding and thematic analyses were performed.&#x0D; Regarding the scholarly publication process, the themes titled as "authoring", "peer reviewing", "editing",n"publication ethics", "dissatisfaction," and "suggestions" emerged in the analysis of the data. &#x0D; The results obtained in this research render academics’ experiences in the publication processes visible. Thus, it enables publication integrity assessment by focusing on the three important agents of the scholarly publication process: the author, reviewer, and the editor. &#x0D; Reviewing the related literature revealed very few studies on publication processes of health sciences academics’. Discussing and revealing the experiences of academics related to the publication process is necessary to increase the transparency and quality of this process. Thus, this study can serve as a guide for future studies.

AB  - Libraries continue to spearhead initiatives to incentivize instructors to adopt, adapt, and create open educational resources (OER). However, these programs often do not explicitly require educators to preserve the OER they create. Drawing on an analysis of semi-structured interviews with six experts, this article presents considerations for libraries interested in preserving OER and recommendations for OER librarians who are new to digital preservation. The study makes an argument for why and how libraries could begin to preserve OER. Future areas of investigation include better understanding how OER repositories preserve such resources and how consortia models can support this work.

AB  - Librarians with faculty status are expected to do research and publish just as their teaching colleagues do. But unlike teaching faculty, most librarians have neither flexible work schedules nor nine-month contracts that are conducive to ongoing research and publication. This means that the requirement to publish in order to be a successful academic often competes with the requirement to perform daily work in order to be a successful librarian. One of the reasons the authors undertook this study was to examine whether the pressure to publish on most academic librarians has an impact on the quality of the literature appearing in library journals. Authors and editors of twenty-two library journals were surveyed to see how both sides of the publishing equation feel about the quality of their end product. This study reveals interesting findings about both editors and authors of library literature, and concludes with suggestions for improving the publishing process.

TI  - A Rationale for the Redesign of Scholarly Information Exchange
IS  - 2
VL  - 44
AU  - Atkinson, Ross
AB  - The disintermediation that will inevitably result from the increased electronic publication of specialized scholarly information affords an excellent opportunity for one of the traditional intermediaries (e.g., libraries, publishers) to assume responsibilities previously held by other intermediaries. Members of the academy should use this opportunity to take back the responsibility for a significant portion of the specialized scholarly publishing that has, in the traditional environment, been placed in the hands of external publishers. The most imposing impediment to such a reappropriation by the academy derives from the inability of institutions to cooperate with each other. If new attitudes could be created within the academy to circumvent that obstruction, then an academy-based process of scholarly information exchange would finally be feasible. One effective model for such a new form of scholarly publishing would be to establish separate domains, or designated channels, for individual disciplines.

TI  - Archiving and Aggregating “Alternative” Scholarly Content: DOIs for blogs.
AU  - Nicholson, Joshua
AB  - The value of blogs and bloggers in science is well recognized. Blogs serve as an excellent form of post-publication peer review and host much of the scientific discussion that occurs on the web today. Indeed, it is probably true that more interaction between scientists and between scientists and the public occurs away from traditional scientific articles themselves and in “alternative” forums such as Twitter, Facebook, and of course, blogs. These mediums are becoming increasingly important in scholarly discourse and often times shape what is written in traditional scholarly articles themselves (i.e. they are often cited). But for all the benefits blogs provide they are not afforded an equal footing. They are superfluous and can disappear without a trace. We want to change that. The content of these discussions can sway opinion and act as authoritative sources in their own right. Blogs are without a doubt valuable and as such deserve to be archived and aggregated, just like traditional scholarly publications are. They deserve to “count,” to be elevated to a level that is not viewed as something extra but as something integral to scientific communication (Nicholson 2014, Nicholson 2015). We need to get around the notion that where you publish actually matters. It doesn’t. It is the content, not the wrapper, and the sooner we act accordingly, the better. So without further ado….Today we are happy to announce that you can now assign a digital object identifier (DOI) to your Wordpress.org blog via The Winnower. This is a first step of many that we are taking towards bringing scientific publishing into the modern era (we’ll soon be releasing an interface for Blogger blogs and Wordpress.com blogs). We hope you’ll help us create this “agora of the modern age” by participating and by letting us know what you think needs changing or improving. Of course, one way to do that is to publish with us and another is to write a blog post! Together we can create an archived virtual library that is accessible to not only those that can pay thousands of dollars to publish but to all. If you have a Wordpress.org blog you can start by downloading our plugin here to start assigning DOIs to your blogs instantly. DIY scholarly publishing is here. References Nicholson, J. M. 2014.

AU  - Moghaddam, Golnessa
AB  - AbstractWith the growing number of scholarly journals in electronic format, long-term preservation of scholarly electronic journals has become one of the most important issues in digital libraries. Accessibility of scholarly journals on the Internet and electronic publishing in general is causing a shift in the responsibility for archiving journals from libraries to agreements between libraries and publishers. The author focuses on some of the important issues surrounding preservation of digital resources, especially scholarly electronic journals and presents a study on the archiving policies of the following publishers: Elsevier, Springer, Taylor & Francis, Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, and IEEE. AcknowledgementThe author gratefully acknowledges Professor Connie Foster, Editor, Serials Review, Head, Department of Library Technical Services, Western Kentucky University Libraries, for help in editing this paper and Ms. Karen Hunter, Elsevier Senior Vice President, for providing information about the Generic Standard Agreement.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution in terms of shares of scholarly book publications in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in five European countries, i.e. Flanders (Belgium), Finland, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. In addition to aggregate results for the whole of the social sciences and the humanities, the authors focus on two well-established fields, namely, economics &amp; business and history. Design/methodology/approach Comprehensive coverage databases of SSH scholarly output have been set up in Flanders (VABB-SHW), Finland (VIRTA), Norway (NSI), Poland (PBN) and Slovenia (COBISS). These systems allow to trace the shares of monographs and book chapters among the total volume of scholarly publications in each of these countries. Findings As expected, the shares of scholarly monographs and book chapters in the humanities and in the social sciences differ considerably between fields of science and between the five countries studied. In economics &amp; business and in history, the results show similar field-based variations as well as country variations. Most year-to-year and overall variation is rather limited. The data presented illustrate that book publishing is not disappearing from an SSH. Research limitations/implications The results presented in this paper illustrate that the polish scholarly evaluation system has influenced scholarly publication patterns considerably, while in the other countries the variations are manifested only slightly. The authors conclude that generalizations like “performance-based research funding systems (PRFS) are bad for book publishing” are flawed. Research evaluation systems need to take book publishing fully into account because of the crucial epistemic and social roles it serves in an SSH. Originality/value The authors present data on monographs and book chapters from five comprehensive coverage databases in Europe and analyze the data in view of the debates regarding the perceived detrimental effects of research evaluation systems on scholarly book publishing. The authors show that there is little reason to suspect a dramatic decline of scholarly book publishing in an SSH.

AB  - Purpose While distribution channels of theses and dissertations have changed significantly in the digital age, they are generally still considered grey literature. This paper aims to argue the applicability of the concept of grey to electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). Design/methodology/approach The paper is presented as a debate between two contradictory opinions on the application of the grey literature concept to ETDs. Findings The paper provides a definition of grey literature and then discusses its application to electronic dissertations and theses. In particular, it assesses the aspects of acquisition, quality, access and preservation. Some arguments highlight the “grey nature” of ETDs, such as the limited access via institutional and other repositories. Other arguments (e.g. the development of ETD infrastructures and the quality of ETDs) question this grey approach to ETDs. The paper concludes that “greyness” remains a challenge for ETDs, a problem waiting for solution on the way to open science through the application of the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability reusability) principles. Research limitations implications Library and information science (LIS) professionals and scientists should be careful about using the concept of grey literature. The debate will help academic librarians and LIS researchers to better understand the nature of grey literature and its coverage, here in the field of ETDs. Originality/value Some definitions from the print age may not be applicable to the digital age. The contradictory character of the debate helps clarify the similitudes and differences of grey literature and ETDs and highlights the challenge of ETDs, in particular, their accessibility and findability.

TI  - A reflection on Springer Nature’s current editorial policies related to “predatory” journals and references
IS  - 2
VL  - 8
AU  - da Silva, J.
C1  - Independent researcher
AB  - Despite its prominent position as one of the leading for-profit scholarly publishers of subscription and open access (OA) journals, and its membership of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA), Springer Nature can be criticized for taking a vague approach in its editorial policies pertaining to “predatory” publishing. While cautioning authors and/or editors about the citation of papers that are published in “predatory” journals, the advice presented in the policies itself is flawed due its limitation to OA journals – thus apparently excluding the possibility that subscription journals might also be “predatory” and failing to specify precisely which journals authors and editors should be careful of, i.e., no source for the “predatory” definition of OA journals is indicated. Moreover, this vague set of policies does not have a publication date, nor is any authorship specified. The opacity of these aspects of these editorial policies limits their usefulness and weakens their objectives, namely in ostensibly offering scholarly advice to protect editors and authors. I argue that the Springer Nature policies pertaining to “predatory” publishing as they currently stand are not useful, and if left unchanged, can be a source of confusion or error for authors and editors of Springer Nature journals. In this connection, the identified risk is that if the poor advice indicated in those policies is heeded, it may encourage abuse, insults and/or indiscriminate profiling of academics, including those associated with Springer Nature journals. While assuming Springer Nature’s genuine intention to alert editors and authors against citing papers published in suspect scholarly venues, I argue that this editorial set of policies should either be rewritten to rely on clearer parameters, including a definitive list of journals for which “predatory” criteria have been defined, or abandoned as they are overly broad. The criticism is aimed at stimulating a discussion among other editors and publishers, especially COPE members.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines journal publications in the field of library and information science (LIS) to assess the level of internationalization in their publications authorship pattern. The international production and communication of scholarly knowledge is crucial to the growth of a discipline. Recent advancement in communication technology and the rise of globalization have led to the hope of a more balanced flow of scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, scholars also cautioned the possibility of a global digital divide and a widening knowledge gap. This study analyzed the geographical affiliations of authors in 20 international LIS journals to track the longitudinal changes in LIS authorship pattern. Findings suggest an increase in the internationalization of LIS authorships over the years. However, the LIS authorship distribution was still highly uneven in 2003 (Gini coefficient = 0.95). Economic power is still found to be a moderate predictor of publication performance. The findings of this study suggest that, at the moment of the writing, there is still room for the LIS field to be more internationalized. Further research is needed to identify the barriers in international scholarly communication and to explore the implications of such a communication pattern on scientific development and global equality.

AB  - Abstract This study uses content-based citation analysis to move beyond the simplified classification of predatory journals. We present that, when we analyze papers not only in terms of the quantity of their citations but also the content of these citations, we are able to show the various roles played by papers published in journals accused of being predatory. To accomplish this, we analyzed the content of 9,995 citances (i.e., citation sentences) from 6,706 papers indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, which cites papers published in so-called “predatory” (or questionable) journals. The analysis revealed that the vast majority of such citances are neutral (97.3%), and negative citations of articles published in the analyzed journals are almost completely nonexistent (0.8%). Moreover, the analysis revealed that the most frequently mentioned countries in the citances are India, Pakistan, and Iran, with mentions of Western countries being rare. This highlights a geopolitical bias and shows the usefulness of looking at such journals as mislocated centers of scholarly communication. The analyzed journals provide regional data prevalent for mainstream scholarly discussions, and the idea of predatory publishing hides geopolitical inequalities in global scholarly publishing. Our findings also contribute to the further development of content-based citation analysis.

AB  - Key points The open access movement continues to gain pace, resulting in increasing regulatory requirements that constrain business models. Plan S itself may only have a modest immediate effect on industry‐wide sustainability but is the clearest indication of the ‘direction of travel’ for our industry yet. Recent negotiations between publishers and consortia represent a ‘bigger deal’ and may therefore lead to even greater economic power for large commercial publishers. Societies have a greater role than merely allowing researchers to get credit for and disseminate their work. A one‐size‐fits‐all model of open access may threaten the sustainability of other community services managed by learned societies. Do not panic about Plan S! Look to the needs of your community and offer a balanced portfolio of publications and services.

AU  - Shearer, Kathleen

C1  - Canadian Association of Research Libraries,
AB  - Despite millions of dollars being spent on research each year in Canada, little attention is paid to the dissemination of the results of research. There is a disconnect between Canadian public policies in this area; although a high priority is assigned to the generation of research, there is a lack of policies addressing its dissemination. Meanwhile, the environment in which research knowledge is being disseminated is undergoing a profound transformation because of several important drivers. In particular, these drivers include new technology, changing research patterns, new users, economics, and commercialization. The major objective of this study was to examine the rapidly transforming environment in which research knowledge is disseminated and determine whether there is a need for a national research strategy to adapt to the new, dynamic scholarly communication environment in Canada. To address the latter question, the study adopted a consensus panel process. A consensus panel of 10 Canadian academic researchers from across Canada from a variety of disciplines and at different stages of their careers was recruited from over 70 volunteers. The objective of the panel was to reach a consensus on priorities for research into scholarly communication in Canada. The consensus panel identified five major themes in which there is a need for research in scholarly communication in Canada: Knowledge systems; knowledge/data storage and retrieval; power and infrastructure within the academy; knowledge production and the social contract; copyright and intellectual property. These themes are expanded upon in more detail in the full paper and specific research topics discussed. The results of this study also clearly support the creation of a more holistic and integrated knowledge ecosystem for scholarly communication. In its report, the consensus panel strongly recommended that, ‘a coherent national policy of knowledge preservation and dissemination must be devised to create a greater cohesion, accessibility, security and access to research findings’.

AB  - Argument mining targets structures in natural language related to interpretation and persuasion which are central to scientific communication. Most scholarly discourse involves interpreting experimental evidence and attempting to persuade other scientists to adopt the same conclusions. While various argument mining studies have addressed student essays and news articles, those that target scientific discourse are still scarce. This paper surveys existing work in argument mining of scholarly discourse, and provides an overview of current models, data, tasks, and applications. We identify a number of key challenges confronting argument mining in the scientific domain, and suggest some possible solutions and future directions.

TI  - Article Processing Charge Hyperinflation and Price Insensitivity: An Open Access Sequel to the Serials Crisis
IS  - 1
VL  - 29
AU  - Khoo, Shaun
C1  - Université de Montréal
AB  - Open access publishing has frequently been proposed as a solution to the serials crisis, which involved unsustainable budgetary pressures on libraries due to hyperinflation of subscription costs. The majority of open access articles are published in a minority of journals that levy article processing charges (APCs) paid by authors or their institutions upon acceptance. Increases in APCs is proceeding at a rate three times that which would be expected if APCs were indexed according to inflation. As increasingly ambitious funder mandates are proposed, such as Plan S, it is important to evaluate whether authors show signs of price sensitivity in journal selection by avoiding journals that introduce or increase their APCs. Examining journals that introduced an APC 4-5 years after launch or when flipping from a subscription model to immediate open access model showed no evidence that APC introduction reduced article volumes. Multilevel modelling of APC sensitivity across 319 journals published by the four largest APC-funded dedicated commercial open access publishers (BMC, Frontiers, MDPI, and Hindawi) revealed that from 2012 to 2018 higher APCs were actually associated with increased article volumes. These findings indicate that APC hyperinflation is not suppressed through market competition and author choice. Instead, demand for scholarly journal publications may be more similar to demand for necessities, or even prestige goods, which will support APC hyperinflation to the detriment of researchers, institutions, and funders.

AB  - <h2>Abstract</h2> Recently most of the journals charge a fee known as article processing charge (APC) for publication of an article. These charges can vary from journal to journal. This publication fee is often paid by the author, the author's institution, or their research funder organization. Though low- and middle-income countries are usually exempted from APC, India does not come under the category of waiver by most of the journals that ask for the APC. Most of the Indian institutes do not pay for publication and research thus individual researcher suffers huge financial burden due to APC. Hence, less affluent institutions, scholars, and students are unable to publish their work due to these barriers. These articles highlight the challenges faced by authors and solutions for publishers and journals to avoid APCs.

AB  - Concerns related to stressed library budgets and equitable access to publicly funded research have fomented a movement towards open access (OA) scholarly publishing, in which academic journal articles are made available online free of charge. OA challenges the traditional subscription-based revenue model of major publishing companies; to supplant lost revenue, many have introduced a new Article Processing Charge (APC) based model, in which the authors of a study pay to ensure their article is available on an OA basis. In the past several years, APCs have risen considerably, shifting the publishing cost burden from university libraries to individual research groups, who often pay APCs out of research funds. Focusing primarily on scientific publishing in North America and Europe, we review the circumstances that brought about the APC model, and argue that rising APCs may present a real threat to research productivity. We conclude by presenting some concrete actions that stakeholders in the academic research enterprise could take to uphold the OA standard and mollify the impact of rising APCs.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the important emerging trends in information technology and is slowly being implemented in libraries. The researchers have presented a brief strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of the application of AI in Pakistani university libraries. Design/methodology/approach This study uses an ethnographic approach for data retrieval. Five chief librarians were interviewed by phone, during which they were asked to identify one key strength, weakness, opportunity and threat in terms of introducing AI technologies. The researchers have used a standard SWOT matrix to report the respondents’ comments. Findings AI is already slowly being introduced into Pakistani university libraries. While commenting on ways in which AI could help their libraries deliver more innovative services and better meet user needs, respondents expressed concern about the investment required in funding, time and staff. Research limitations/implications Further study is indicated to identify existing AI implementations in Pakistani university libraries and to assess relevant library users’ perspectives. This study is limited to brief, qualitative data; its main purpose is to validate the use of a SWOT analysis. Practical implications Given that AI-based tools are already being used in libraries to some degree regardless of location, now is an opportune time to develop strategies for implementing AI technologies more widely. A SWOT analysis can be used to identify and categorize challenges and risks specific to AI in a logical way to support strategic decision-making. Originality/value To date, no SWOT analysis has been conducted in the context of AI applications in libraries, let alone specifically university libraries in Pakistan.

AB  - Despite promising outcomes in higher education, the widespread adoption of learning analytics remains elusive in various educational settings, with primary and secondary schools displaying considerable reluctance to embrace these tools. This hesitancy poses a significant obstacle, particularly given the prevalence of educational technology and the abundance of data generated in these environments. In contrast to higher education institutions that readily integrate learning analytics tools into their educational governance, high schools often harbor skepticism regarding the tools’ impact and returns. To overcome these challenges, this work aims to harness learning analytics to address critical areas, such as school dropout rates, the need to foster student collaboration, improving argumentation and writing skills, and the need to enhance computational thinking across all age groups. The goal is to empower teachers and decision makers with learning analytics tools that will equip them to identify learners in vulnerable or exceptional situations, enabling educational authorities to take suitable actions that are aligned with students’ needs; this could potentially involve adapting learning processes and organizational structures to meet the needs of students. This work also seeks to evaluate the impact of such analytics tools on education within a multi-dimensional and scalable domain, ranging from individual learners to teachers and principals, and extending to broader governing bodies. The primary objective is articulated through the development of a user-friendly AI-based dashboard for learning. This prototype aims to provide robust support for teachers and principals who are dedicated to enhancing the education they provide within the intricate and multifaceted social domain of the school.

AB  - The extent to which data visualizations are used, and the quality of these visualizations, has consistently been shown to influence human decision-making relative to static (non-visual) presentations of findings or ideas (Boldosova &amp; Luoto, 2019; El-Wakeel et al., 2020; Liem et al., 2020). Why are visualizations so impactful? Likely because most decision-makers do not want to sort through spreadsheets or read a novel-length narrative to understand what is important—they want it straight and quick. They want color, novelty, storytelling, and interactivity (Dykes, 2020; Kostelnick, 2016; Kosara &amp; MacKinley, 2013). This is the purpose of data storytelling: to literally tell a story about the data analyses to, in some way, impart knowledge or affect change among the audience. Data and data analysis are never neutral—they are always political–and storytelling is how the data analyst can attempt to influence how data findings are perceived by the audience. This paper discusses the basis of data storytelling and why it is important for creating a narrative around data visualizations that compels readers and viewers to act upon findings. It then discusses (in the form of a reflective discussion) how the art of data storytelling may be improved and activated to promote social justice themes by reflecting on the effectiveness of storytelling in hip hop music.

AB  - In this paper, we present our approach to solve the LongSumm 2020 Shared Task, at the 1st Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing. The objective of the long summaries task is to generate long summaries that cover salient information in scientific articles. The task is to generate abstractive and extractive summaries of a given scientific article. In the proposed approach, we are inspired by the concept of Argumentative Zoning (AZ) that de- fines the main rhetorical structure in scientific articles. We define two aspects that should be covered in scientific paper summary, namely Claim/Method and Conclusion/Result aspects. We use Solr index to expand the sentences of the paper abstract. We formulate each abstract sentence in a given publication as query to retrieve similar sentences from the text body of the document itself. We utilize a sentence selection algorithm described in previous literature to select sentences for the final summary that covers the two aforementioned aspects.

AB  - The Web, with its explosive growth, is becoming an efficient resource for up-todate information for the scientific researcher.Informal online archives are repositories for technical reports.Proceedings are more and more commonly published on the Web.The collection of online journals is growing.Indeed, a good number of online journals are "born digital".Many researchers simply put their papers up on their own web site.The large volume of online material makes it quite desirable to be able to access cited documents immediately from the citing paper.Implementing this direct access is called "reference linking".Some reference linking services exist today.A number of commercial publishers, recognizing the significant value-added nature of reference linking, have banded together to form the CrossRef organization.The CrossRef publishers share their metadata, which enables them to interlink their journals.This metadata is not, however, available without a fee to organizations or individuals outside of CrossRef.The vast majority of online scholarly literature is accompanied by little or no metadata.Since it is desirable to link up this literature as well, the problem of automatically reference linking online scholarly literature in the absence of metadata and author intervention is a problem very much worth considering.This paper explores this problem in detail, and presents some algorithms for extracting metadata from online texts and linking full-text documents together.The extent to which reference linking of the online literature can be done automatically is therefore the main topic of this paper.

AB  - Nonprofit scientific societies hope that their activities advance their particular mission and impact their profession and, in the broadest sense, humanity in positive ways. The digital age has provided unprecedented mechanisms to enhance the delivery of science to the world. The marketplace of scientific publishing is a rapidly shifting mosaic of challenges and opportunities, and the responses of nonprofit and commercial publishers vary widely, but their outcomes are still uncertain. The response of the American Society of Mammalogists (ASM) provides an example of how a relatively small society has altered its scientific delivery to enhance member benefits while attempting to sustain its economic viability. Since 2000, ASM has moved from a self-publishing, break-even, print-only model to a copublishing agreement with a commercial publisher (Alliance Communications Group, a division of Allen Press, Inc., Lawrence, Kansas), which now offers members various print and electronic options and generates a shared royalty. Although it is too early to gauge the economic impact of these changes, the ASM leadership clearly attempted to signal its desire for members to view their society as a package of opportunities for edification and involvement rather than just a provider of serial subscriptions. Future challenges facing nonprofit scientific societies include open access, fiscal realities, archiving of publications, and scientific and societal impact; future opportunities include a strengthening of member responsibilities and professionalism, development of data registries to enhance scientific progress, and bundling of like societies. The manner in which nonprofit scientific societies respond to these challenges and opportunities will no doubt affect their sustainability and future impact.

AB  - Studies documenting the usage patterns of electronic journals have compared print and e-journal characteristics, surveyed faculty for their perceptions and expectations, and analyzed the impact on library practices. This study, a qualitative exploration of a wide array of issues related to the research and teaching habits of early adopters of e-journals in a research setting, was conducted in the spring of 2001 with faculty in the basic and health sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Open-ended questionnaires provided a framework to wide-ranging discussions of perceptions, expectations, and changing practices pertaining to e-journals and other electronic resources. The results were analyzed with a specific focus on shared behaviors and values, discipline-dependent variations, and changing research and teaching habits. Several challenges for library resources and services are identified and discussed.

AB  - Abstract Assessing Scholarly OutletsMore recently researchers, scholars, and authors have experienced a proliferation of outlets fordisseminating the results of their scholarly undertakings. Moreover, many of the aforementionedhave received solicitations for disseminating the results of their scholarly undertakings. Thisproliferation is due in great part to the improved time-to-market strategies aided by the Internetto disseminate new knowledge and the entrepreneurial spirit of publishers. Improving time-to-market serves the research community well in that once integrated into the knowledge base thesescholarly outputs serve as a foundation for spawning additional knowledge, faster. However, theentrepreneurial spirit of some publishers threatens the progress in the pursuit of new knowledgeby, as an example, flooding disciplines with findings based on pseudoscience. Researchers,scholars, and authors are receiving solicitations from a brood of questionable industries,commercial endeavors, and partnerships whose goal is to maximize revenue. They help tofacilitate presenting at conferences and publishing in conference proceedings and junk journalsthat publish low quality or pseudoscience science (vs sound science), and they help in theproliferation of vanity publishers (vs mainstream or commercial publishers).An endeavor was initiated by a technology, management, and applied engineering faculty toexamine some of the aforementioned concerns and to develop strategies for addressing thoseconcerns. Among the strategies discussed, pursued, or developed, were the following:As an individual faculty member:• Modify, if appropriate, any contract you sign with a commercial publisher to ensure your right to use your work, including posting on a public archive.• Examine the pricing, copyright, and licensing agreements of any commercially published journal you contribute to as an author, reviewer, or editor.• Consider using your influence by the choices you make about where to publish, and about service as a reviewer or member of an editorial board, and by influencing your colleagues to do the same.• Support your library's efforts to take cost into consideration in making decisions about journal subscriptions.• Investigate your campus intellectual property policies and participate actively in their development.• Support your library's participation in projects that seek to transform scholarly publishing in accord with academic values, such as SPARC, the Scholarly Publishing & Academic Resources Coalition.As a member of the campus community:• Encourage discussion of scholarly communication issues and proposals for change in your department and school.• Invite library participation in faculty departmental meetings and graduate seminars to discuss these issues.• Include electronic publications that meet standards of quality in promotion and tenure discussions.• Critically assess journals and publishers for quality using established criteria.As a member of professional societies:• Encourage your professional society to consider creating alternatives to expensive commercial titles.• Support actively your society's electronic publishing program by submitting papers, reviewing, and serving on editorial boards.• Encourage your society to explore alternatives to contracting or selling publications to a commercial publisher.• Encourage your society to maintain reasonable prices, and faculty and user friendly access terms.

AB  - The open access (OA) movement seeks to ensure that scholarly knowledge is available to anyone with internet access, but being available for free online is of little use if people cannot find open versions. A handful of tools have become available in recent years to help address this problem by searching for an open version of a document whenever a user hits a paywall. This project set out to study how effective four of these tools are when compared to each other and to Google Scholar, which has long been a source of finding OA versions. To do this, the project used Open Access Button, Unpaywall, Lazy Scholar, and Kopernio to search for open versions of 1,000 articles. Results show none of the tools found as many successful hits as Google Scholar, but two of the tools did register unique successful hits, indicating a benefit to incorporating them in searches for OA versions. Some of the tools also include additional features that can further benefit users in their search for accessible scholarly knowledge.

AB  - This paper reports on a survey of 198 early career researchers from Spain, which aimed to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards predatory journals. The results revealed that the primary characteristic of predatory journals is their fast acceptance and publication times, while many other features are similar to legitimate journals. The study recommends several actions, including raising awareness and providing mentorship, promoting ethical publishing practices, and allocating resources to early career researchers by academic institutions. The findings highlight the need for better education and support for researchers in identifying and avoiding predatory journals. The study's conclusions have implications for policymakers, academic institutions, and individual researchers seeking to maintain the integrity of scholarly publishing.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the use of scholarly communication platforms in Zambia, exploring the perceptions, usage patterns and factors influencing the adoption and utilisation of these platforms among Zambian researchers and academics. Employing a cross-sectional survey design, the study gathered data from a sample of faculty members and researchers at selected universities in Zambia. The survey instrument consisted of three sections, collecting information on demographic background, scholarly communication practices in Zambia and the scholarly communication platforms used by the academic community. The findings reveal insights into the perceptions of scholarly communication services, the challenges faced by Zambian researchers in accessing and utilising scholarly resources and potential strategies to enhance scholarly communication in the country. Additionally, the study identifies the scholarly communication platforms most widely used by the Zambian academic community and the factors influencing their adoption and usage. This research contributes to the limited literature on scholarly communication in Zambia, providing valuable insights for stakeholders involved in promoting and enhancing scholarly communication practices within the country.

Learn more.Copy URL Share a linkShare onFacebookTwitterLinkedInRedditWechat Can we no longer trust what is published? Last month I was caught up in a 'sting' to identify predatory journals. I had reviewed an article for a journal and after submitting my review (with recommendation of Reject) I came across the same article in a leading journal/magazine. As the article sent to me had been blinded, I assumed that the authors had plagiarized the article. However, it had been submitted by the same author group and the journal editors (who had also identified the duplication) started pursuing the matter with the authors. A few weeks later the lead author contacted the journal to say he was withdrawing it and he revealed that it had been part of an ethics committee approved research project in which the same article had been sent to 600 journals to see if they would spot that it was already published. Like many other people, I have read the several stings that test dodgy journals (e.g. Bohannon, 2013) with interest and been shocked to discover how apparently bad their quality control systems are. However, being the recipient gave me a somewhat different perspective. I had spent a few precious hours reviewing an article for no purpose and I have to admit that I was annoyed about the waste of time – as were the journal editors. The journal it had been submitted to cannot afford the time or money to check every submission via a reliable duplication-checking tool, and I suspect many of the other journals participating in the research were in a similar situation. On the one hand, it will be interesting to discover how many journals accepted the article without discovering its duplication, and on the other hand, it is concerning that so many precious reviewer-hours have been lost to reviewing this article. At Learned Publishing, we do not routinely check every article for plagiarism but rely on the integrity of the authors – only checking where we have a suspicion (style changes or other hints). Our decision is informed by experience, and in the past few years we have only once found a true case of plagiarism – all other apparent duplications were legitimate. The premise behind the research project above, however, is that authors cannot be trusted and all editors should be checking everything. The questions over scholarly trust and integrity continue to make headline news. Concerns about 'fake news' in scholarly publishing either from fraudulent authors or poor quality journals have reached the mainstream press outlets. There is understandable concern about the trustworthiness of scholarly information. An article in the Indian Express ('pay, publish, profit' Yadav, 2018) outlines an emerging industry in low quality journals, which have arisen to provide an outlet for the booming number of researchers and the increasing pressure to publish. Several German journalists initiated their own sting by submitting an article on the use of propolis to control cancer. The rubbish article was both accepted and published, although it has now been retracted. (The article can be found at the following URL: https://www.omicsonline.org/peer-reviewed/combined-effects-of-ethylacetate-extracts-of-propolis-inducing-cell-death-of-human-colorectal-adenocarcinoma-cells-102225.html.) (I am not citing it as I do not want to 'reward' the journal with citation.) Whilst the sting proved a point about lack of quality controls, it should be remembered that the article remains available and citable in support of other hypotheses and research. Whilst the sting may have proved a point, the journalists are now responsible for yet more untrustworthy research being published. It is of particular note that so many articles in this issue of Learned Publishing cover the subject of trust and reliability from different perspectives. Several articles describe the research publishing environment operating in other regions and provide windows to very different experiences. Mahmood Maniati and Alireza Jalilifar (2018) describe the attitudes and strategies of Iranian authors to achieve publication. Iranian authors are usually required to write in English and often suffer from limited research environments but where expectations of publication are high if they wish to keep their jobs. As the authors reveal, Iranian researchers not only have to rely on enlightened editors who are willing to go the extra mile but often feel obliged to adopt unethical strategies in order to achieve publication in the journals of their choice. The strategies do not – according to the authors – undermine the value of the science that the articles report, but they would fail the 'ethical imperative' that is placed on authorship. From the other side of the fence, Radovan Vrana (2018) discusses the challenges that face editors based in small research communities. His analysis of the problems experienced by Croatian editors demonstrates similar problems as faced by all editors, but exacerbated by their environment. He reports difficulties in obtaining reviewers, poor quality reviewer reports, and author misconduct. Comparing this article with the one from Iran clearly demonstrates the tension between the authors' need to publish and the journal editors' wish to maintain standards and selectivity. It is an invidious problem in any journal, but enhanced in resource-poor environments. Vrana describes the huge difficulty in obtaining good reviewers when journals are seen to be 'peripheral' and lack branding. Without good quality review it is hard (perhaps impossible) to only publish high quality research, and so the journals languish in a mid-quality limbo. Promising support to such journals as Vrana describes, as well as those that may be less reliable (or even fraudulent) is a booming industry of accreditation. The article by Xia and Smith (2018) investigates such services. Journals compete to attract authors as well as improve the likelihood of reviewers accepting invitations to review. To help in this competition, they often look for external validation. The gold standard is indexing within Scopus or Medline, or the achievement of an Impact Factor, but only a small number of journals actually achieve this. The recent problems with the Indian University Grants Commission list of recognized journals show how difficult this process of identifying quality journals can be (Patwardhan et al., 2018). The article from Xia and Smith reports on their investigation into companies who have created different metrics for accrediting journals. They reveal a potentially misleading and even fraudulent accreditation system, but one that is being applied as a proxy for trust (in the same way that the Impact Factor is used). Whether the participating journals are aware or not is unclear; however, the application of these validation tools is certainly misleading to researchers (my own discussions with researchers in Egypt and other countries). A fourth aspect of judging the quality control and relevance of journals is addressed by Camillo Lamanna and Stevan Bruijns (2018). Lamanna and Bruijns question what metrics are really useful for determining journal and article relevance – especially in developing regions. They question the accepted proxy of citations as a meaningful quality measure for all users and propose different methods for developing regions such as the sub-Saharan African countries. They suggest that citations are only valid measures within close networks and question their use for those outside these networks. And finally, the paper by Scott, Gibson, and Benner (2018) reveals how drug advertising in journals is frequently misleading because it lacks suitable supporting references – and frequently cites as evidence works authored by company staff. Their conclusion is that such advertising fails the ethical quality criteria that the journals' editorial systems require. Whilst their investigation does not question the quality of research articles in the journals they evaluated, they do reveal shockingly low standards in the advertising which the selected medical journals carry. This has trust implications for the journal as a whole, since it is reasonable for readers to assume the same integrity levels are applied throughout the journal. The questions of trust and quality are also central to our first review articles. This new article type will review interesting industry white papers and other reports and ensure they are archived for future reference. The first two of these articles by Rachel Kessler (2018) and Tom Hill (2018) review papers on data sharing and blockchain in research, respectively. These two areas are under regular discussion as methods for increasing transparency, reproducibility, and validation of scholarship. Returning to the 'sting' research that led to this editorial. We work on a system of trust in publishing, which (if you believe the frequent publications on the topic) appears to be eroding daily. However the focus of discussions on 'predatory' journals may be a selective bias that ignores other problems of equal concern. Can – and should – we trust authors? Should we no longer trust what is published in journals? Can we believe any of the accreditation systems? Are even the trusted journals allowing unreliable content to be published? And how much should we be concerned about this? I suggest that perhaps the ease of establishing online open journals funded by authors under pressure to publish may be backfiring. There is a rapidly growing research population who need a commensurate growth of journals to accommodate their outputs. Equally, this growing research population needs a reliable system that both educates and rewards them on the quality of their work, rather than demanding output. Unless a means of accrediting published research is identified that encompasses all researchers and all journals – not just the small percentage lucky enough to be included in the key indexes – we will perpetuate the existing landscape that divides elite researchers/readers from the underprivileged. Those that can afford it will pay the high APCs to publish in high quality journals, and those that cannot will turn to other (potentially untrustworthy) journals. Equally, where publishing is dominated by commercial interests this is always going to influence how and what is published. These commercial influences are rarely considered by those looking for scholarly content, but because they could affect what is published they have direct effect on trustworthiness. The leading role for academic institutions cannot be underestimated if we are to avoid disenfranchising large swathes of the research community. Unfortunately, however, the mismatch between the global publishing environment and a fragmented evaluation system will make a solution which is in the public interest hard to find.

AB  - The wide application of digital technologies to scholarly communications has disrupted the model of academic library service that has been in place for the past century. Given the new Internet tools and the explosive growth of digital content available on the Web, it is now not entirely clear what an academic library should be. This article is an attempt to provide a strategy for academic libraries in what is left of the first quarter of the 21st century. There are five components of the model: 1) complete the migration from print to electronic collections; 2) retire legacy print collections; 3) redevelop library space; 4) reposition library and information tools, resources, and expertise; and 5) migrate the focus of collections from purchasing materials to curating content. Each of the components of the strategy and their interactions will be considered. It is hoped that the result will provide a useful roadmap for academic libraries and the campuses they serve.

AB  - Transparency, openness, and reproducibility are important characteristics in scientific publishing. Although many researchers embrace these characteristics, data sharing has yet to become common practice. Nevertheless, data sharing is becoming an increasingly important topic among societies, publishers, researchers, patient advocates, and funders, especially as it pertains to data from clinical trials. In response, ASTRO developed a data policy and guide to best practices for authors submitting to its journals. ASTRO's data sharing policy is that authors should indicate, in data availability statements, if the data are being shared and if so, how the data may be accessed.

AB  - The emergence of the Internet has triggered tremendous changes in the publication of scientific peer-reviewed journals. Today, journals are usually available in parallel electronic versions, but the way the peer-review process works, the look of articles and journals, and the rigid and slow publication schedules have remained largely unchanged, at least for the vast majority of subscription-based journals. Those publishing firms and scholarly publishers who have chosen the more radical option of open access (OA), in which the content of journals is freely accessible to anybody with Internet connectivity, have had a much bigger degree of freedom to experiment with innovations.The objective was to study how open access journals have experimented with innovations concerning ways of organizing the peer review, the format of journals and articles, new interactive and media formats, and novel publishing revenue models.The features of 24 open access journals were studied. The journals were chosen in a nonrandom manner from the approximately 7000 existing OA journals based on available information about interesting journals and include both representative cases and highly innovative outlier cases.Most early OA journals in the 1990s were founded by individual scholars and used a business model based on voluntary work close in spirit to open-source development of software. In the next wave, many long-established journals, in particular society journals and journals from regions such as Latin America, made their articles OA when they started publishing parallel electronic versions. From about 2002 on, newly founded professional OA publishing firms using article-processing charges to fund their operations have emerged. Over the years, there have been several experiments with new forms of peer review, media enhancements, and the inclusion of structured data sets with articles. In recent years, the growth of OA publishing has also been facilitated by the availability of open-source software for journal publishing.The case studies illustrate how a new technology and a business model enabled by new technology can be harnessed to find new innovative ways for the organization and content of scholarly publishing. Several recent launches of OA journals by major subscription publishers demonstrate that OA is rapidly gaining acceptance as a sustainable alternative to subscription-based scholarly publishing.

AB  - Article processing charges ( APC s) are a central mechanism for funding open access (OA) scholarly publishing. We studied the APCs charged and article volumes of journals that were listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals as charging APCs. These included 1,370 journals that published 100,697 articles in 2010. The average APC was $906 U.S. dollars (USD) calculated over journals and $904 USD calculated over articles. The price range varied between $8 and $3,900 USD, with the lowest prices charged by journals published in developing countries and the highest by journals with high‐impact factors from major international publishers. Journals in biomedicine represent 59% of the sample and 58% of the total article volume. They also had the highest APCs of any discipline. Professionally published journals, both for profit and nonprofit, had substantially higher APCs than journals published by societies, universities, or scholars/researchers. These price estimates are lower than some previous studies of OA publishing and much lower than is generally charged by subscription publishers making individual articles OA in what are termed hybrid journals.

AB  - The increasing need for organizations to keep a high level of synchronization around the world and the coming of new advancements are pushing increasingly more to move decision-making and operational power from the focus of associations to their edges. The blockchain could be the critical innovation to roll out this improvement conceivable. A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Blockchain is pleased with the fact that it provides high satisfaction and a trust bond to its users. Data immutability, decentralization, anonymity, auditability, and transparency are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. This paper presents a study of blockchain technology to provide a comprehensive analysis that includes types, architecture, components, characteristics, and applications of blockchain.

AB  - A survey of 998 scholarly journals that use Open Journal Systems (OJS), an open source journal software platform, captures the characteristics of an emerging class of scholar-publisher open access journals. The journals in the sample follow traditional norms for peer-reviewing, acceptance rates, and disciplinary focus, but as a group are distinguished by the number that offer open access to their content, growth rates in new titles, participation rates from developing countries, and extremely low operating budgets. The survey also documents the limited degree to which open source software can alter a field of communication, for OJS appears to have created a third path, dedicated to maximizing access to research and scholarship, as an alternative to traditional scholarly society and commercial publishing routes.

AB  - Recently, a large public academic institution in the US ended its subscription to the most influential publisher of academic research. This institution was driven by the principle that scientific knowledge should not be locked up behind paywalls as the costs of publishing have grown over the years. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prospects of publishing and accessing scientific knowledge from Open Access Journals (OA) and to get a general understanding of what aspects to decide on when a research scholar intends to publish in a Scopus indexed Open Access journal. OA journals are freely available with no cost on the internet. They provide unrestricted access to scientific literature to spread recent updates in various disciplines of science and technology. Method: In this study, the researcher has conducted a non-random survey in alphabetical order, 30 Open Access Scopus indexed Psychology journals for the purpose of understanding and comparing their policies and article processing charges. Result: Based on the survey, research scholars can make decisions based on which journals would be viable for publishing their articles looking at these policies. While some of the journals do not have article processing fees some of the journals charge article processing fees.

AB  - The use of the Internet is one of the solutions to tackle the communication problems during the covid-19 pandemic. Online activity, which can be done to facilitate learning a language, especially English, is preferable to be synchronous and asynchronous online communication. This research focuses on using asynchronous online communication of the learning management system to enhance students' writing ability in pre-intermediate writing subjects during the covid-19 pandemic. The method of the research is a quantitative method with One-Group Pretest-posttest design. The research population is the second-semester students, and the sample of the research is pre-intermediate writing class C, which consists of 23 students. The data analysis results show that the student's average score on the pre-test is 76.96, and the mean score of the post-test is 79.83, which means that the mean score of the post-test is higher than the mean score of the pre-test. In other words, the gained score is 2.87. Wilcoxon test for non-parametric statistics is applied to decide the hypothesis. The calculation of the test statistic showed that the z test result is 2.62 with a 2-tailed significance is 0.009. It indicates that the result is significant since 0.009 is less than 0.05 (0.009 &lt; 0.05). It means that the Null hypothesis (H0) is rejected, while the Alternative hypothesis (H1) is accepted. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a significant effect of using asynchronous online communication of the learning management system (www.schoology.com) on students' writing ability. The study implies that this LMS model is visible in ELT, especially to improve the students' four skills, such as writing ability.

AB  - Scientific communication has undergone deep transformations, since the emergence of Internet. Aiming to provide further thought on the evolution of scientific communication, this paper features a historical overview of the scientific communication advances over the last twenty years through a three-phase model for the evolution of the electronic journal and the preprints services, and presents Brazilian contemporary panorama for scientific communication. The three-phase model presented in this work is an adaptation of that one proposed by Tenopir et al. (2003) to describe the patterns of journal use by scientists since 1990. The early evolutionary phase followed the emergence of the first digital journals and the creation of repositories in the Web for publishing preliminary versions of scientific literature on the author’s initiative; by that time, most academics reproved electronic publishing initiatives. From 1996 and forward, in the consolidation phase, electronic journals were commonly identical to their print counterparts; the acceptance of the electronic format began to increase, and preprint services got underway in several disciplines. The advanced evolutionary phase started with the world discussion on open access to scientific information. The comparison of the current electronic journal with that viewed by enthusiasts in the first years of the 1990s shows that some aspects still remain to be improved in electronic formal and informal communication, towards effective dissemination of scientific information.

AB  - This paper aims for a better understanding of the perspectives of contributors to Spanish academic journals regarding open access, open peer review, and altmetrics. Specifically, it explores how age, gender, years of professional experience, and perception and use of social media influence authors’ opinions of these developments in scholarly publishing. A sample of 295 contributors to Spanish academic journals participated in a survey about the aforementioned topics. They were found to hold a favourable opinion of open access but were more cautious about open peer review and altmetrics. The responses of younger and female scholars indicated more reluctance to accept open peer review practices. A positive attitude toward social networks did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for emerging trends in scholarly publishing. Despite this, ResearchGate users were more aware of altmetrics.

AB  - Abstract This paper studies a selection of 11 Norwegian journals in the humanities and social sciences and their conversion from subscription to open access, a move heavily incentivized by governmental mandates and open access policies. By investigating the journals’ visiting logs in the period 2014–2019, the study finds that a conversion to open access induces higher visiting numbers; all journals in the study had a significant increase, which can be attributed to the conversion. Converting a journal had no spillover in terms of increased visits to previously published articles still behind the paywall in the same journals. Visits from previously subscribing Norwegian higher education institutions did not account for the increase in visits, indicating that the increase must be accounted for by visitors from other sectors. The results could be relevant for policymakers concerning the effects of strict policies targeting economically vulnerable national journals, and could further inform journal owners and editors on the effects of converting to open access.

AB  - We present the systems we submitted for the shared tasks of the Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing at EMNLP 2020. Our approaches to the tasks are focused on exploiting large Transformer models pre-trained on huge corpora and adapting them to the different shared tasks. For tasks 1A and 1B of CL-SciSumm we are using different variants of the BERT model to tackle the tasks of "cited text span" and "facet" identification. For the summarization tasks 2 of CL-SciSumm, LaySumm and LongSumm we make use of different variants of the PEGASUS model, with and without fine-tuning, adapted to the nuances of each one of those particular tasks.

AB  - Using a database of recent articles published in the field of Global Health research, we examine institutional sources of stratification in publishing access outcomes. Traditionally, the focus on inequality in scientific publishing has focused on prestige hierarchies in established print journals. This project examines stratification in contemporary publishing with a particular focus on subscription vs. various Open Access (OA) publishing options. Findings show that authors working at lower-ranked universities are more likely to publish in closed/paywalled outlets, and less likely to choose outlets that involve some sort of Article Processing Charge (APCs; gold or hybrid OA). We also analyze institutional differences and stratification in the APC costs paid in various journals. Authors affiliated with higher-ranked institutions, as well as hospitals and non-profit organizations pay relatively higher APCs for gold and hybrid OA publications. Results suggest that authors affiliated with high-ranked universities and well-funded institutions tend to have more resources to choose pay options with publishing. Our research suggests new professional hierarchies developing in contemporary publishing, where various OA publishing options are becoming increasingly prominent. Just as there is stratification in institutional representation between different types of publishing access, there is also inequality within access types.

AB  - ABSTRACT One of the most important issues facing scholarly communication today is what constitutes quality in the publishing and dissemination of research findings; the aim of this exploratory research study was to investigate author‐perceived quality characteristics of science, technology and medicine journals. We triangulated data from a small number of volunteer full‐time faculty members of Long Island University, using three different research techniques: (1) questionnaire survey, (2) focus groups, and (3) semi‐structured face‐to‐face interviews. The study identified some significant differences by discipline, gender, and tenure status. Overall, the three most important attributes were the reputation of the journal, the estimated length of time to article publication, and the readership of the journal. Our findings bring new insight into this area for the scholarly research community as a whole.

AB  - ABSTRACT Responses from almost 1,250 academic authors around the world were analysed to obtain their views on electronic publishing of learned journals. Currently, having a print version of journals is still more important to them than an electronic version. The issue of greatest importance to authors and readers is the continuing availability of back volumes, and there are strong concerns about pricing of electronic journals. The potential gains in publication speed through publishing electronically appear not to be a priority. Electronic preprint and reprint archives are used very little at present, with the exception of the physics and mathematics communities. Of all publisher‐mediated tasks, the peer‐review process is the most valued, followed by provision of citation‐linking. Respondents' views of future developments in electronic publishing are also explored.

AB  - Predatory publishing is now rapidly growing and becoming a global challenge to scientific communities. Predatory publications pose a danger that could undermine the quality, integrity, and reliability of published scientific research works. They harm the career of those authors who published on them. The researchers should be aware of the quality of journals while publishing their research results. In this review, we briefly summarize the ways to spot out predatory publications, their harmful effects, and strategies to stop them. Authors should know the lists of predatory journals/publishers which are available on Beall’s list on the internet. Predatory journals take advantage of authors by asking them to publish for a fee without providing peer-review or editing services. The young and inexperienced authors are easy victims of predatory publications. The predatory publications are worthless, just a waste of time, resources, money, and efforts. The objective of this review paper was to create awareness about predatory journals among researchers and scholars.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess the factors that influence authors' decision when choosing a journal for publication and to assess authors' attitudes and practices regarding emerging journals. Methods:cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted between April and July 2017 at Dubai Medical College, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on a convenience sample of 2,764 healthcare professionals. Results: A total of 250 responses were received (response rate: 9%) and 152 valid respondents were included in this study (5.6%), of which the majority were male (61.2%) and aged 41–60 years (68%) from the Middle East and Africa. Most respondents (88.8%) had medical and/or dental qualifications and the majority were in senior clinical (55%) and academic (71.5%) positions. More than half of the respondents (62.5%) had published at least one article in the previous five years. Results showed that journal impact factor (JIF), indexation status, free submission and being international were important among respondents. Based on the respondents that shared their encounters with emerging journals (n = 114), 62 respondents (54.4%) regularly read certain emerging journals, 51 (44.7%) had been a peer-reviewer, 48 (42.1%) had cited content from an emerging journal at least once and 45 (39.5%) had published in emerging journals. Only 18 respondents (14.2%) were not convinced with the need for emerging journals and believed that all researchers should compete for publication in the same international journals. Conclusion: Selection of target journals is driven mainly by JIF, indexation status, free submission and a journal’s international status. A diverse range of opinions and attitudes regarding emerging journals were observed in this study. Keywords: Journal Impact Factor; Open Access Publishing; Editorial Policy; Peer Review; Indexing; Publications; Attitude; United Arab Emirates.

AB  - Purpose Peer reviewer evaluations of academic papers are known to be variable in content and overall judgements but are important academic publishing safeguards. This article introduces a sentiment analysis program, PeerJudge, to detect praise and criticism in peer evaluations. It is designed to support editorial management decisions and reviewers in the scholarly publishing process and for grant funding decision workflows. The initial version of PeerJudge is tailored for reviews from F1000Research's open peer review publishing platform. Design/methodology/approach PeerJudge uses a lexical sentiment analysis approach with a human-coded initial sentiment lexicon and machine learning adjustments and additions. It was built with an F1000Research development corpus and evaluated on a different F1000Research test corpus using reviewer ratings. Findings PeerJudge can predict F1000Research judgements from negative evaluations in reviewers' comments more accurately than baseline approaches, although not from positive reviewer comments, which seem to be largely unrelated to reviewer decisions. Within the F1000Research mode of post-publication peer review, the absence of any detected negative comments is a reliable indicator that an article will be ‘approved’, but the presence of moderately negative comments could lead to either an approved or approved with reservations decision. Originality/value PeerJudge is the first transparent AI approach to peer review sentiment detection. It may be used to identify anomalous reviews with text potentially not matching judgements for individual checks or systematic bias assessments.

AB  - According to the OA Diamond Journals Study of diamond open access journal operators, 53% of journals employ less than one full-time worker, and 60% of journals rely heavily on volunteers. Due to these resource constraints, most diamond open access journals publish less than 25 articles per year, and 75% of journals are not able to provide their content in XML and HTML but only in PDF (Bosman et al., 2021, p. 7-8).For them to keep up with larger commercial publishers and their professionalized content output, a high degree of process automation and streamlining is necessary. The Open Source Academic Publishing Suite (OS-APS, https://os-aps.de/en/) project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research aims to achieve this. Smaller and medium-sized publishers usually deliver Word manuscripts. OS-APS automatically extracts the underlying XML from these manuscripts, offers optimization, and, most importantly, export in various formats (PDF, HTML, XML, EPUB). Professional corporate design, such as that of the PDFs, is also managed automatically by reusing templates or by creating one’s own with the OS-APS Template Development Kit.In addition, OS-APS will also connect to scholarly and community-driven publishing platforms such as Open Journal Systems (OJS), Open Monograph Press (OMP), and DSpace: the software will be able to be integrated into a wide range of publication processes, whether with small, low-resource, commercial, institutional, or diamond open access publishers. To understand the requirements of these heterogeneous publishers, the OS-APS project has a practical advisory and a scientific advisory board with representatives from the different publishing sectors. In addition, it regularly holds demo days with feedback opportunities. One such demo will be given at PUBMET2022.The Open Source software could be a significant improvement for smaller, independent OA publishers to streamline their processes, create new e-book formats (such as HTML, EPUB), and secure their long-term presence and bibliodiversity. The project is in line with the recommendations of the OA Diamond Study and its call for cOAlition S funders and infrastructures to “support the development of generic tools to generate structured content in XML and HTML” (Becerril et al., 2021, p. 20).

AB  - This paper focuses on Automation and Digitization of school libraries as an impetus for effective teaching and learning. This is to facilitate information searches and retrieval with the use of computer hardware’s and software’s necessary for this action. The paper also discusses school libraries with its sole objective of improving teaching and learning in primary and post primary schools by providing necessary materials that will complement and supplement school curriculum. The resources and services available in school libraries such as, print and non-print were also enumerated. The paper also highlighted the concept of digitization Automation as it enhances effective use of library resources. Challenges encountered in Digitizing school libraries as inadequate funding, lack of qualified manpower to operate the computer system, inadequate facilities and equipment e.t.c. were also emphasized. Conclusively, the paper proffers recommendations as a way forward to the challenges encountered in school libraries. DOI: 10.5901/jesr.2013.v3n10p79

VL  - 15
AU  - Piotrowski, Michael
C1  - University of Lausanne, Department for Language and Information Sciences, Lausanne, Switzerland
AB  - Typesetting systems, such as LATEX, permit users to define custom markup and corresponding formatting to simplify authoring, ensure the consistent presentation of domain-specific recurring elements and, potentially, enable further processing, such as the generation of an index of such elements. In XML-based and similar systems, the separation of content and form is also reflected in the processing pipeline: while document authors can define custom markup, they cannot define its semantics. This could be said to be intentional to ensure structural integrity of documents, but at the same time it limits the expressivity of markup. The latter is particularly true for so-called lightweight markup languages like Mark-down, which only define very limited sets of generic elements. This vision paper sketches an approach for user-defined semantic markup that could permit authors to define the semantics of elements by formally describing the relations between its constituent parts and to other elements, and to define a formatting intent that would ensure that a default presentation is always available.

VL  - 47

AB  - Background: Predatory journals (PJs) are journals that receive and publish articles through unethical publishing practices. Due to the boom of PJs, researchers face a wide range of journals from which to choose. Non-peer reviewed and low-quality articles can ruin the trustworthiness of science and have a damaging impact on decision-makers. Objective: &amp;nbsp;To assess the level of awareness among Ethiopian researchers of PJs and to improve the awareness level through training. Method: &amp;nbsp;The participants were professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and lecturers from different disciplines. The study included 18 statements for participants to indicate their level of awareness on the Likert scale, questions on knowledge resources on PJs, and open-ended questions about ways of avoiding PJs. A one-day programme trained the participants in detecting and avoiding PJs. Results: &amp;nbsp;43 participants completed the pre-assessment online survey and 37 participants completed the post-assessment survey. Many researchers were unaware of PJs and found it somewhat difficult to differentiate PJs from legitimate journals. However, during the post-assessment, the awareness level improved and the participants&amp;rsquo; rating of the task of differentiating PJs from legitimate journals changed from &amp;lsquo;Somewhat difficult&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;Easy&amp;rsquo;. Conclusion: &amp;nbsp;Many researchers were unaware of the potential distinctions between PJs and legitimate journals that are crucial to an appropriate journal for publishing. Especially low awareness was found on the journal impact factor, journal indexing services, and reputable publishers. Hence, before manuscript submission, authors ought to know and practise evaluating journals on the basis of the recommended criteria.

AB  - Academics and scholars need to publish their research results. In addition, they are required to publish scientific papers to prove their research commitment and to achieve certain academic titles in higher education institutions. Globally, there are many scientific journals of well-known publishing houses/universities, which offer opportunities to publish scientific work. One of the recent topics in academic circles is the increasing number of invitations to publish articles via quick procedures, without going through the adequate review process. This phenomenon is threatening academic integrity, as these publishers/journals aim at financial benefits and not contributing to scientific development and progress. There is a gap in the knowledge of the scientific researchers regarding the journal selection to publish their work. Some of them are still unintentionally publishing in such journals, mainly as a lack of information about them. The main purpose of this study is awareness-raising, warning, and guidance of scientific researchers, particularly young researchers by providing information on how to avoid submitting manuscripts in these journals. To achieve this, we have consulted the recent literature and practices of different countries, summarized the most used tools/methods to identify predatory publishers and journals, and lastly, we have developed a guiding algorithm for evaluating them.

AB  - Objectives: There is a recent proliferation of predatory journals (PJ) targeting unwary authors and unsuspecting institutions. We evaluated the awareness, attitude, and practices related to predatory publishing among physicians from the Middle East and Africa. Subjects and Methods: An online survey of a convenience sample of physicians was conducted. One hundred and forty responses were received. Of these 76 were complete and they formed the basis of this study. Results: Respondents hold a specialty board or equivalent (46.1%), doctorate (26.3%) or Master (13.2%). Half of the respondents published between 1 and 10 articles and less than a fifth had no prior authorship experience. Respondents are reportedly fully aware (30.3%) or fairly familiar but were not confident with details (43.4%), whereas 26.3% have no clear idea about models of publishing (open access [OA] vs. subscription-only). Nearly one third have never heard about predatory publishing and one in six of the respondents may have heard about it, but they were not sure. 69.7% reported no knowledge of Jeffery Beall and his list. The majority thought it might be somewhat difficult (51.4%) or difficult (24.3%) to distinguish between predatory and legitimate OA journals and 40%–60% affirmed knowledge of features of predatory publishing practices. 50%–60% recognized that PJ target authors in the developing nations. Respondents reported a variable frequency of unsolicited E-mails inviting them to submit articles to suspected PJ or act as reviewers or editors. Only a minority would take further action to protest against such invitations. Many respondents suggested warning young researchers and inexperienced authors about PJ by improved supervision and mentorship practices. Conclusions: There is a low awareness of predatory publishing. There were varying attitudes and practices among respondents.

AB  - Abstract Background Along with emerging open access journals (OAJ) predatory journals increasingly appear. As they harm accurate and good scientific research, we aimed to examine the awareness of predatory journals and open access publishing among orthopaedic and trauma surgeons. Methods In an online survey between August and December 2019 the knowledge on predatory journals and OAJ was tested with a hyperlink made available to the participants via the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) email distributor. Results Three hundred fifty orthopaedic and trauma surgeons participated, of which 291 complete responses (231 males (79.4%), 54 females (18.6%) and 5 N/A (2.0%)) were obtained. 39.9% were aware of predatory journals. However, 21.0% knew about the “Directory of Open Access Journals” (DOAJ) as a register for non-predatory open access journals. The level of profession (e.g. clinic director, consultant) ( p = 0.018) influenced the awareness of predatory journals. Interestingly, participants aware of predatory journals had more often been listed as corresponding authors ( p &lt; 0.001) and were well published as first or last author ( p &lt; 0.001). Awareness of OAJ was masked when journal selection options did not to provide any information on the editorial board, the peer review process or the publication costs. Conclusion The impending hazard of predatory journals is unknown to many orthopaedic and trauma surgeons. Early stage clinical researchers must be trained to differentiate between predatory and scientifically accurate journals.

AB  - Authors face many choices when selecting a journal for publication. Prospective authors, especially trainees, may be unaware of “predatory” online journals or how to differentiate them from legitimate journals. In this study we assessed awareness of open-access and predatory journals among prospective authors attending scientific writing workshops; our long-term goal was to inform educational goals for the workshops. We surveyed participants of writing workshops at veterinary and medical schools and an international conference over a 1-year period. The survey included 14 statements for respondents to indicate agreement level on a Likert-like scale and four questions on awareness of resources about predatory journals; respondents also defined “predatory journal”. A total of 145 participants completed the survey: 106 (73.1%) from veterinary schools and 86 (59.3%) graduate students or residents. Fewer faculty (vs trainees) agreed that open access was an important factor in deciding where to publish; faculty and postdoctoral researchers were more likely to expect to pay more to publish in an open-access journal. Most respondents (120/145, 82.7%) agreed/strongly agreed that the decision to accept a manuscript should not be influenced by publication charges, but 50% (56/112) indicated they “didn’t know” how publishing costs were supported. Of the 142 respondents who answered, 33 (23.0%) indicated awareness of the term “predatory journal”; 34 (23.9%) were aware of the Directory of Open Access Journals; 24 (16.9%) were aware of the Science “sting” article about predatory journals; and 7 (4.8%) were aware of Beall’s list. Most (93/144, 64.5%) definitions of predatory journals described poor but not predatory journal practices, and some respondents misunderstood the term completely. Mentors should help novice authors to be aware of predatory journals and to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate open-access journals, thus selecting the best journal for their work.

TI  - A word about supplemental materials

VL  - 79

AB  - As with other issues, it often takes a question to the Editor for which I do not have an answer to draw my attention to a matter. This is the case for the topic of this Editor's Message on supplemental materials. The Journal first started publishing supplemental materials in 2009, and there has been a steady increase in the number of published manuscripts in the Journal with supplemental materials over the past 6 years from 4% in 2009 to 31% in 2014. This increase is consistent with other journals in environmental sciences. For example, Kenyon and Sprague (2014) reported that in 2011 between 22–65% of the published articles in a subset of journals focused on biology, forestry, or fisheries were accompanied by supplemental materials. Their review of supplemental materials showed that journals publishing new research had more supplementary materials than those that published mainly reviews or meta-analyses, and that studies using coarse methods like climate change modeling or land cover mapping had fewer supplemental materials than work based on fine-scale methods such as genetic analyses despite each being data intensive. Journals that focused on short communications or were established since 2000 also had relatively high numbers of supplementary materials. The Journal of Wildlife Management guidelines (Block et al. 2011) currently indicate that “Supplemental material is manuscript information that adds depth to the manuscript but is not essential to readers' understanding of the manuscript (e.g., spreadsheets, detailed equations, video or audio files, in-depth tables and figures).” They currently differ from appendices by not being directly part of the results and in being published separately and only on-line. Supplemental materials are available to the reviewers, reviewed by the editors, and content edited by the Journal staff, but they are not copyedited or typeset so they should be considered ready for publication when the final manuscript is submitted. Wiley Blackwell, our publisher, hosts supplemental materials associated with Journal articles in an open access format, requires a formal decision by the Editor-in-Chief for their uploading, and will not add them at a later stage after acceptance (exchanges.wiley.com/blog/2004/09/01/supplementary-material/, accessed 11 Jun 2015). In the supplementary documents we require authors to entitle them as “Supplemental Materials” and to provide a date, citation for the associated manuscript, and literature cited. Supplemental materials fall under the same copyright agreement as the main article and errors found in them should be corrected via an erratum in the Journal. Our guidelines are not inconsistent with other journals, but there is high variation. In a review of journals in environmental sciences, Kenyon and Sprague (2014) reported that journal guidelines ranged from a disclaimer that the publisher of a journal (e.g., Wiley Blackwell) was not responsible for the content or functionality of supplemental materials (pointing the readers to the author for questions) to indicating that supplementary materials are expected to be of the level of quality as the articles with reviewers formally being asked whether all the materials are necessary for the article. Some journals had strict limits (5–150 MB) and placed tight restrictions on formats, whereas others accepted a wide variety of formats and file types. Some journals required a readme file for metadata, descriptions by type of file extensions, and additional text as descriptive captions, whereas others required minimal information on content. Approaches to hosting materials across journals ranged from posting on author-maintained websites to being hosted by the publisher with either open or paid access. Digital publishing indeed has extended options for submitting materials to support published articles. On-line supplemental materials allow long tables and data sets, and other graphical material to be made available that would be expensive to publish otherwise. However, as with other issues in scholarly publishing, the growing use of supplemental materials poses challenges. In 2010, the Journal of Neuroscience announced they would no longer allow authors to include or host supplemental materials (Maunsell 2010). The Editor-in-Chief, John Maunsell, initially considered the information in supplemental materials cost-effective but viewed the fact that their growth far exceeded the growth of information in articles (measured in megabytes per article) as problematic; he concluded “the sheer volume of material is adversely affecting peer review.” He argued that most reviewers are overburdened with requests to review manuscripts (see Merrill and Cox 2014) and asking them to also review supplemental materials, which often can be as extensive as the article itself, detracted from the quality of the review of the article. It also led to an “arms race” where authors submit supplemental information that may “immunize them again the reviewer's concerns.” In the past when publishing was restricted by the printed page, all materials integral to the article were printed. With the advent of electronic media that could handle multi-media, data sets, details on methods, and computer code among others items, the risk of integral materials getting detached from the article arose. Maunsell (2010) argued this undermined the principle of a “self-contained research report by providing a place for critical material to get lost.” It remains to be seen what effect the increase in availability of data repositories and more emphasis on data journals (see Merrill 2014) will have on these trends. Concerns about the long-term maintenance and regular access to supplementary materials also have been expressed. Anderson et al. (2006) in assessing biomedical journals over the period 1998–2005, found links to supplemental data maintained on publishers' websites were active in only 74% of instances. When publications sponsored by societies change publishers, such as The Wildlife Society (TWS) did in moving from Allen Press to Wiley Blackwell in 2011, access can be become problematic. Thus far, TWS has preserved the integrity to supplemental materials across publishers because articles published before 2011 directed authors to a TWS server (i.e., Table S1 at www.wildlifejournals.org) that is linked to the current publisher's website. Williams (2013) in her interviews with soil scientists also reported difficulties with accessing data due to changing file formats. Supplementary materials easily can become unreadable when new software versions no longer support obsolete file formats. Further, García-Pérez (2015) argued that on-line supplementary materials were “black holes” for citations. Based on a randomly selected sample of articles published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013, he found that references only available in the on-line supplemental materials added an additional 10% to the references cited and, with rare exceptions, they were not incorporated into citation databases. Requesting authors to produce a single list of references from the main paper and supplemental materials and posting this in the on-line version of the article as is done for articles in Science may address this issue (Hanson et al. 2011). The disarray caused by the growth in supplemental materials also poses technical challenges for librarians, abstract and indexing services, and repository administrators. Their concerns resulted in a joint initiative by the National Federation of Advanced Information Services (NFAIS) and National Information Standards Organization (NISO) in the United States to make general and technical recommendations for best practices for on-line supplemental materials (NISO and NFAIS 2013). They emphasized the conceptual division of materials into those that are integral and those that are additional to the article. As long as journals remain in print or when page charges apply, the distinction between categories may remain blurred. In any case supplemental materials need to be justified by the authors. The Journal promotes peer review of supplemental materials but recognizes reviewer overload exists. Because reviewers are likely to put less effort into supplementary materials, Associate Editors, the content editor, and Editor-in-Chief need to play pivotal roles in safeguarding their relevance and redundancy. Future standardization and emphasis on metadata in supplemental materials may be required not only to facilitate review but to simplify linkages to other digital repositories as funding agencies require more detailed data management plans. Assignment of digital object identifiers (DOI) also may assist in long-term preservation. Societies working with their publishers can promote access and discoverability in citation indexing services, and find new approaches to facilitate linkages for readers to move easily back and forth between the article and supplemental materials. As the forms of digital publishing continues to morph, effective guidance to its authors, reviewers, and editors in addressing these challenges will be key for The Society to effectively meet its mission of providing science-based research to our professional members. —Evelyn Merrill Editor-in-Chief

TI  - Bad Language and Scholarly Publishing: Use It or Lose It?
IS  - 3
VL  - 29
AU  - Owens, Jacqueline

AB  - Recently I was editing an article accepted for publication and discovered that the authors described an example using a phrase that replaced part of a word with ∗∗, as many do when posting on social media. The word in question was a derisive slang term that refers to a woman. It was not as shocking as the F-word, but certainly not acceptable language. I realized that I had not yet come across this dilemma in my experience, even though I have served in an editorial role for 12 years. I have published articles that included profane words such as hell or damn from qualitative interviews; while these were distasteful, I found the ∗∗ word to be worse. Yet, this was the term that was used by the authors and inclusion would reflect accuracy in this discussion. This issue piqued my interest and I decided to investigate bad language in scholarly writing in the literature. For my search I used terms such as “profanity,” “swearing,” “obscenity,” and “slang.” I also queried the editors and others who participate in the International Academy of Nursing Editors (INANE) email discussion. For my report herein, I consider bad language to be profanity of all types and slang or colloquialisms that are hurtful and possibly incendiary. I offer my findings and include some thoughts for consideration that I believe will assist both editors and authors of scholarly manuscripts who face this dilemma. Few academic publications have directly addressed bad language in scholarly writing. Those that have considered profanity or offensive slang, such as slurs, were dated. Style manuals offered advice about writing tone and using accurate terms, but were published at a time when it was likely less acceptable to see this type of language in print and thus this concern was not specifically addressed. However, even while dated, they did offer suggestions that may apply to this current and growing dilemma. For example, both print and online resources such as the APA Manual (APA, 2) and the Purdue Online Writing Lab, ([OWL], 1995–2019;) discussed similar topics about possibly offensive language in scholarly writing, due to bias related to gender, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, disabilities, or age, and the use of mild slang and colloquial terms in general. In their classic, The Elements of Style, Strunk and White (2000) offered two helpful suggestions. First, if use of a slang word is deemed necessary, refrain from drawing further attention to it by adding quotation marks for emphasis; rather just use it. They also noted the dynamic nature of language, with word meanings always in a state of change. Thus, it is better to consider established usage over current trends. Corbett and Finkel (5) noted that no single word can be labeled as inappropriate in and of itself, and this may be especially so in technical writing where words or practices common to that audience are not out of place. This assertion supports the use of exact quotes that may include words offensive to some readers. The Purdue OWL (1995–2019) website does not specifically address profanity, but includes information about levels of formality that suggests a style of writing appropriate to both your purpose and the expectations of your audience. This website notes that it is acceptable to include slang or jargon when you write for an audience that includes members of a group who would frequently use and understand these terms. It is clear that the use of offensive slang and every manner of profanity is on the rise (Bergen, 3), and this has been addressed frequently related to its use in non-scholarly, online venues such as websites, blogs, or social media. Two examples are noteworthy. A piece published in The New York Times (Sheidlower, 7) stated that as a society we have become more comfortable with profanity and suggested that the media has not kept the same pace, instead using euphemisms or dashes or asterisks as part of the offensive word. Sheidlower (7) described an example published in an academic journal in 1934 that discussed the history of a highly offensive profane term, the F-word, without even using it once, much as I am doing right now. The Associated Press Stylebook (AP, 2019) also recommends a partial spelling, suggesting hyphens in place of some letters in the word to convey the meeting without including exact term and inclusion of an editor's note. Bergen (2016), a professor of cognitive science who studies swearing and what it reveals about us, our use of language, and our brains, noted the temporal aspect of profanity and the increasing use of slurs. He described in his book multiple examples of words that used to be or have become profane, due to current social constructs. Reading about the evolution of these words, it is not unreasonable to wonder whether any word we may innocently use in its current context might be considered profane sooner or later! Bergen (3) suggested that bans are typically ineffectual. We use many similar sounding words or phrases, known as minced oaths, to avoid profanity, such as oh sugar, or shut the front door. He noted one particularly troublesome current trend among profanity usage, that of slurs, suggesting this as an exception to otherwise harmless swearing and far more offensive to most. Considering use of slurs on the continuum of free speech to censorship, Bergen (3) offers the old adage that just because you can it does not mean you should. Both the temporal aspect of word meanings and the harmful potential of slurs are solid reasons to thoughtfully consider decisions about including bad language in scholarly print. As early as 1993, an article in Editor & Publisher questioned whether publishing profanities constituted censorship to avoid controversy, noting that, “arguments for and against using certain terms are subjective” (Venit, as cited by Case, 4, p.11). One viewpoint offered in the article suggested the danger of editing profanity and leaving the reader to imagine something much worse. The author asserted that in newsrooms, decisions are made on a daily basis about questionable words and advised that discussions with multiple people are helpful in this process to assure different perspectives are represented. To that end, this discussion synthesizes the thoughts of the 15 editors who participated in the INANE listserv conversation about my query regarding use of bad language in scholarly nursing journals. The discussion expanded into recognizing phoniness and flowery language, often referred to in print as bullshit, in academic writing in general and specific to nursing. This article considers use of profane or offensive slur words only, versus their connotation as applied to critique academic writing which is beyond the scope of this article. Discussion related using profanity or offensive slang considered the temporal element of language; interest versus scholarly tone; and contextual purity versus scholarly tone. Several editors also offered helpful questions to consider when making such a decision. One editor referred to the temporal element discussed in the literature, especially of offensive slang, and noted that this is often not considered. Similar to thoughts from Bergen (3), Strunk and White (2000), and information from the APA Manual (2), he noted that, “words have the power we assign them – Scandalous as it would be to use the words bloody and bugger in 1750, today these get barely a chuckle. Ten years from now, it may again be scandalous” (Personal communication, D. Olson, January 30, 2019). The discussion considered the dilemma of creating interest among readers versus adherence to scholarly tone. One editor commented that being provocative may have a purpose, but passages were still possibly borderline offensive and thus not appropriate. Another felt that the benefits of using bad language rarely outweighed the risk and suggested consideration as to whether the point could be made without that specific word. Several suggestions from editors mirrored practices common in publishing, such as using an asterisk as part of the spelling of the word; inserting the word [expletive] or leaving a space; and adding a disclaimer to explain the omission of certain words (AP, 2019; APA 2; Sheidlower, 7). These editors advised taking the high road (i.e., omit the offensive word) and use of discretion. A few editors had mixed feelings, first noting that bad language is not appropriate in scholarly journals in general, but making the exception of quotes from qualitative data. Direct quotes are an important component to demonstrate trustworthiness in a qualitative study. One editor gave an example of publishing words as they were spoken, but also noted that she had not been presented anything more offensive than the word bitch, rather mild in nature compared to some other profanity. Even while supporting the purity of qualitative data to provide absolute context from the quotation, one person felt that using bad language in these quotes is still a slippery slope that can lead to a lower standard. The increasing use of slurs that Bergen (3) noted adds another layer of complexity to the decision to honor contextual purity with direct quotes including that type of language. Several participants (personal communications, J. Castner, December 22, 2018, and A. Valdez, January 30, 2019) offered questions to consider when making the decision to include bad language in a scholarly publication, as follows: Discussing these questions prior to the final decision, or even before the occasion arises, may inform an appropriate rationale to support whatever action is taken. There are multiple recommendations related to appropriate writing for scholarly work. Because this article is considering profanity and offensive slang, these included below are specific to use of bad language. Resources do address similar topics about possibly offensive language due to bias related to gender, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, disabilities, or age; and the use of mild slang and colloquial terms in general. These may be helpful to inform a decision about the use of bad language. This is important to consider as some profanity or offensive slang, specifically slurs, can also reflect such biases, including the use of labels (APA, 2; Bergen, 3). Use a style manual to consider similar recommendations that may also be appropriate to inform your final decision. Check for precedents. If you are an editor, investigate how this may have been handled in the past. If you are an author, investigate your selected journal to see if you can find an example of bad language. Start by mirroring the editorial strategies of what has been previously published. Resist making the decision in a vacuum; seek input from others. If appropriate, be sure that your supervisors are aware of the dilemma and the support for any decision. The APA manual (2) offers a suggestion for writers of historical information. The challenge in this context is to preserve historical accuracy and the manual recommends using the original language, but including an asterisk the first time it is used, with an explanatory comment. This strategy could be useful to indicate rationale for including language from raw data to preserve context, especially in cases where the word meaning has evolved since the original usage, and also offers an explanation for this decision. The APA manual (2) recommends respect for people's preferences, and the change in preferences over time. A quick Google search revealed several university-based or reputable organizational sources to access an LGBTQ glossary of terms. Make an effort to find the most current acceptable language to avoid unintentional slang that may be hurtful or inappropriate. Consider the purpose of the manuscript, the journal, and the audience for this venue (Purdue OWL, 1995–2019). It may be entirely appropriate to quote bad language when including qualitative data in a report for a research journal where the readers will understand and appreciate inclusion of exact quotes. You might wonder how my dilemma ended. Because one of my areas of expertise is qualitative methods, I am a purist when it comes to quoting language to preserve the context to every extent possible. That does not mean I do not struggle with the use of this type of language in scholarly writing. After considering the risks versus benefits, as suggested by one of the editors, I had a discussion with the authors about my concerns. The word in question was a slur. It was not a quote, but an example of sexual harassment in an article about that topic. They felt strongly about using the word as is, but were willing to allow me to first state it in a scholarly way and then use it parenthetically as an example, qualifying it as a colloquial term. I was comfortable with that decision because I felt we put intentional thought into this dilemma, at minimum. Also, this was middle of the road bad language - not the worst you can imagine. The compromise to use the word, but note it as colloquial, acknowledged explicitly that we were stepping away from scholarly tone to preserve integrity of data. I still ask myself, could I do this if the word were even more incendiary? Best practice is for each editor and writer to give intentional consideration to potential risks and benefits of using a particular incendiary word or phrase. The goal is to reach consensus and thoughtfully represent the individual manuscript and journal content. Jacqueline K.

AB  - The post-print era was peculiar for a dramatic shift in the study of the humanities.Concomitant with this insurgency called digitization was the inscription of ideology on the minds of its subjects which succeeded in disconcerting many of those who spoke confidently for a digital revolution in the academic context.The debate whether digitized knowledge should be scrutinized in a competitive or a cooperative light has brought with it a certain indeterminacy of definition which allows it to figure in a varied span of concerns: self and other, past and present, sign and concept, etc.My argument is that the category of the digital assumes the polysemy it does in our modern world because, in speaking of the humanities, it speaks also of power relations which are at the heart of the struggle for cultural hegemony.Ultimately, in its cooperative or competitive underpinnings, the subjectivity of the user is the epistemic source most actively engaged in producing and extracting meaning in a digital context.

AB  - Abstract Most researchers today are bombarded with spam email solicitations from questionable scholarly publishers. These emails solicit article manuscripts, editorial board service, and even ad hoc peer reviews. These “predatory” publishers exploit the scholarly publishing process, patterning themselves after legitimate scholarly publishers yet performing little or no peer review and quickly accepting submitted manuscripts and collecting fees from submitting authors. These counterfeit publishers and journals have published much junk science? especially in the field of cosmology? threatening the integrity of the academic record. This paper examines the current state of predatory publishing and advises researchers how to navigate scholarly publishing to best avoid predatory publishers and other scholarly publishing-related perils.

AB  - The publishers and providers of e‐journals take great pride in the diverse designs of their websites. Yet how these websites present, identify, and link together the publications that they display can make the end‐user task of discov‐ ering articles and accessing them easy, frustrating, or completely fruitless. In 2010, NISO established a workgroup to draft recommended practice guidelines for the presentation and identification of e‐journals (PIE‐J) to help publishers ensure that e‐journal content can be reliably discovered, cited, and accessed by users over time. The recommended practice guidelines emphasize the need to retain the original title and citation information across all journal formats and provide constructive advice to help with the presentation of born‐digital content as well as to support the contin‐ ued digitization of content from journals originally published only in print. The guidelines will be presented to at‐ tendees of this session, along with information on how the guidelines were drafted and how the guidelines relate to other standards and best practices. In an article in Information Standards Quarterly pub‐ lished in spring 2009, Reynolds and Hepfer describe a scenario in which a frustrated undergraduate work‐ ing on a writing assignment faces various challenges in her search for the full text of a specific article start‐ ing with a standard, abbreviated citation to that arti‐ cle. A great deal of the difficulty that the fictional student encounters stems from a lack of standardiza‐ tion in the way in which e‐journals are presented. Various policies and practices have contributed to creating a sometimes overwhelmingly complex online environment for journal content. Since 1971, most U.S. libraries have followed cataloging rules that require each significantly changed title of a jour‐ nal to be cataloged as a separate record; the result is that libraries effectively consider a changed title to have become a new journal for identification, con‐ trol, and inventory purposes. Often the new title has a different ISSN from the old title. Editors may feel content is more marketable if it is presented under the current journal title, and may not reference his‐ torical titles. Product managers and website design‐ ers may seek a simpler and more elegant arrange‐ ment than breaking the content into the various pieces that place it under (multiple) changed titles. Not all content providers either think to consult li‐ brarians or employ librarians to advise on content presentation. In addition to problems with presentation of journal content on the web for readers, there are also diffi‐ culties with link resolvers used by academic and other institutions to connect users with content. Typically, these link resolvers help guide readers to journal articles by using the metadata in Open URLs (ANSI/NISO Z39.88). If the source citation (as repre‐ sented by OpenURL metadata) and the knowledge‐ base identify the same content with different journal titles and ISSN, then the corresponding target links will not be offered to the user. Content that a library has paid for will not be served to a researcher, even though that content has been licensed and should be available to its users. Further, even when guided to the appropriate content by the link resolver, re‐ searchers may be confused by seeing one title in a reference and landing on a page that appears to be an entirely different title. In order to provide publishers and other content providers with practical guidance, the National In‐ formation Standards Organization (NISO) convened a working group on Recommended Practices for the Presentation and Identification of E‐Journals (PIE‐J). PIE‐J is jointly headed by Bob Boissy, Director, Net‐ work Sales, Springer (Robert.Boissy@springer.com)

AB  - 'Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to understanding our potential.' Margaret J Wheatley. The focus of any academic or research author is to share his or her findings, and to gain respect and reward for publishing. The ideal journal is one that not only publishes an article quickly but also helps the author to improve the article before publication through peer review, selects only the best research so that the author's article lies alongside other high quality articles, and provides maximum (and long-term) visibility and access to the article. Unfortunately, in the real world, authors need to make tradeoffs between high quality journals, those that work quickly, those that are willing to accept the article and those that provide the best access. Into this mix has come the potential of open access as a means of increasing visibility: journals publish the article without a subscription barrier so anyone, anywhere, can read the article. However, the growth of open access (pushed by institutions, grant bodies and governments as a means of improving human health and knowledge) has come with some unforeseen consequences. In this article, Jeffrey Beall discusses one recent phenomenon that has arisen from the open access movement: that of 'predatory publishers'. These are individuals or companies that use the open access financial system (author pays, rather than library subscribes) to defraud authors and readers by promising reputable publishing platforms but delivering nothing of the sort. They frequently have imaginary editorial boards, do not operate any peer review or quality control, are unclear about payment requirements and opaque about ownership or location, include plagiarised content and publish whatever somebody will pay them to publish. Predatory publishers generally make false promises to authors and behave unethically. They also undermine the scholarly information and publishing environment with a deluge of poor quality, unchecked and invalidated articles often published on temporary sites, thus losing the scholarly record. Jeffrey Beall, a librarian in Denver, US, has watched the rise of such fraudulent practice, and manages a blog site that names publishers and journals that he has identified as predatory. While Beall's lists can provide librarians and knowledgeable authors with information on which journals and publishers to be cautious about, several legitimate publishers, library groups and others have joined forces to educate and inform authors in what to look for when selecting journals to publish in (or read). This initiative, called Think. Check. Submit. (http://thinkchecksubmit.org/), was launched in the latter half of 2015 and hopes to raise awareness of disreputable journals while clearly separating them from valid, high quality, open access journals (of which there are many).

AB  - Abstract The aim of this paper is to examine the status of national learned societies in social sciences and humanities (SSH) in Europe. Previous research shows that learned societies serve diverse roles in higher education and suggests that national societies come under pressure given different developments, such as internationalization or open science adoption. We investigate a comprehensive range of aspects within national learned societies: primary goals, activities, internationalization, organization, funding, membership, and recent changes, addressing potential pressures arising from them. Using a cross‐national survey involving 194 learned societies across eight European countries, we study: (a) do the previous findings from individual countries or small selections of national societies hold for a broad range of learned societies in SSH across Europe, and (b) are national learned societies coming under pressure due to internationalization and commercialization processes? Our findings confirm previous results from single countries and single disciplines and expand them as our results show that national learned societies in SSH play an important role in Europe in promoting multilingualism in science, collaborating with many stakeholders, and fostering interdisciplinarity. Contrary to previous research, most SSH societies in our study have not undergone significant changes in the past 5 years, challenging expectations of their declining role.

AB  - PURPOSE/THESIS: This paper identifies some of the tasks and roles that academic libraries have to perform in order to react to the emergence of Research 2.0. APPROACH/METHODS: The argument is based on a non-exhaustive review of the recent literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Academic libraries should respond to the emergence of Research 2.0 by filling niches in services provided by other academic units. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS: As a rule, only the literature of the second half of the 2010s was taken into consideration. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The tasks identified in this paper may not seem urgent today, but the likelihood that they will become an imperative in the future is high. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The issues identified in this paper are already a part of everyday best practices in several countries.

AB  - The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) has amassed large databases (including paleontological) as a result of its research on the geology of the ocean floor.ODP has begun to present its research results in electronic proceedings that will soon completely displace paper publications.Palaeontologia Electronica (PE) has pioneered the concept of an all-electronic paleontological journal with no paper equivalent.The publication and distribution of electronic data and scholarly papers are no longer the cutting edge of publishing technology; the cutting edge now moves to the next generation of electronic documents.The wide experience gathered by ODP and PE, from the collection of drilled cores and data, through preliminary reports to final scholarly publication, has provided the historical background.The next generation of electronic publications will include refinement of some of the present elements supported by technological improvements to create a product that meets the full spectrum of needs within the scientific community.The goals for these publications should include the creation of a truly dynamic platform for the exchange of information and ideas; the permanent, long-term archive of published materials and the data on which they are based; improved world-wide access; and a realistic and improved presentation of text, data, graphics, and other media.

AB  - Abstract Web citations have been proposed as comparable to, even replacements for, bibliographic citations, notably in assessing the academic impact of work in promotion and tenure decisions. We compared bibliographic and Web citations to articles in 46 journals in library and information science. For most journals (57%), Web citations correlated significantly with both bibliographic citations listed in the Social Sciences Citation Index and the ISI's Journal Impact Factor. Many of the Web citations represented intellectual impact, coming from other papers posted on the Web (30%) or from class readings lists (12%). Web citation counts were typically higher than bibliographic citation counts for the same article. Journals with more Web citations tended to have Web sites that provided tables of contents on the Web, while less cited journals did not have such publicity. The number of Web citations to journal articles increased from 1992 to 1997.

AB  - To evaluate the growth of our journal, Ciencias Marinas, over the years since its inclusion for indexing in 2 major international databases, we performed a joint analysis of 8 bibliometric indicators: impact factor, source normalized impact per paper (SNIP), CiteScore, SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), cites per document, total cites, percent international collaboration, and h-index. In general, 6 of the 8 indicators suggest that growth for Ciencias Marinas can be qualified somewhere between satisfactory and good. The other 2 indicators, SNIP (1999–2017) and SJR (2010–2017), did not show significant changes for the time period analyzed.

AB  - In this study we combine the registered output of a whole university in the Netherlands with data retrieved from the Web of Science. The initial research question was: is it possible to show the impact of the university in its' full broadness, taking into account the variety of disciplines covered in the research profile of the university? In order to answer this question, we analyzed the output of the university as registered in the CRIS system METIS, over the years 2004-2009. The registration covers a wide variety of scholarly outputs, and these are all taken into account in the analysis. In the study we conduct analyses on the coverage of the output of the university, both from the perspective of the output itself, towards the Web of Science ("external"), as well as from the Web of Science perspective itself ("internal"). This provides us with the necessary information to be able to draw clear conclusions on the validity of the usage of standard bibliometric methodologies in the research assessment of universities with such a research profile.

AB  - We test 16 bibliometric indicators with respect to their validity at the level of the individual researcher by estimating their power to predict later successful researchers. We compare the indicators of a sample of astrophysics researchers who later co-authored highly cited papers before their first landmark paper with the distributions of these indicators over a random control group of young authors in astronomy and astrophysics. We find that field and citation-window normalisation substantially improves the predicting power of citation indicators. The sum of citation numbers normalised with expected citation numbers is the only indicator which shows differences between later stars and random authors significant on a 1 % level. Indicators of paper output are not very useful to predict later stars. The famous h-index makes no difference at all between later stars and the random control group.

AU  - Setti, Gianluca

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the main features of several bibliometric indicators which were proposed in the last few decades. Their pros and cons are highlighted and compared with the features of the well-known impact factor (IF) to show how alternative metrics are specifically designed to address the flaws that the IF was shown to have, especially in the last few years. We also report the results of recent studies in the bibliometric literature showing how the scientific impact of journals as evaluated by bibliometrics is a very complicated matter and it is completely unrealistic to try to capture it by any single indicator, such as the IF or any other. As such, we conclude that the adoption of more metrics, with complementary features, to assess journal quality would be very beneficial as it would both offer a more comprehensive and balanced view of each journal in the space of scholarly publications, as well as eliminate the pressure on individuals and their incentive to do metric manipulation which is an unintended result of the current (mis)use of the IF as the gold standard for publication quality.

AB  - Elsevier is currently positioned as the largest scholarly publisher, a dominant force in open access publishing, and a provider of workflow and analytics tools for research and science. Now it is slated to serve as the sole subcontractor in the European Commission's Open Science Monitor, cementing its role as a leading data analytics provider in the industry. This dominance across multiple sectors is bringing increased scrutiny from researchers and advocates for open science and open access to research. With loud objections to Elsevier's role in the Open Science Monitor project and contentious license negotiations as Germany and Sweden attempt to combine their big deals with open access publishing services, the role of traditional publishers in new models of scholarly communication and research support is being questioned more than ever.

AB  - Despite holding the potential to liberate scholarly information, the digital era has, to the contrary, increased the control of a few for-profit publishers. While most journals in the print era were owned by academic institutions and scientific societies, the majority of scientific papers are currently published by five for-profit publishers, which often exhibit profit margins between 30%-40%. This paper documents the evolution of this consolidation over the last 40 years, discusses the peculiar economics of scholarly publishing, and reflects upon the role of publishers in today’s academe.

AB  - This qualitative study examines perceptions of open access from focus groups including thirty-eight faculty who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). In responses, BIPOC faculty reflect on the culture and support of open access within their departments, institutions, and professional associations. It was at a time of increased discussion about knowledge equity, the impact of access to research during the 2020 pandemic, and a precursor to the 2022 U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy Memo to expand access to data and publications sponsored by all federal funding agencies. In general, BIPOC faculty face compounded risks with open access and inequities in scholarly publishing. However, participants believe open publishing processes allow more flexibility and connection to communities. The investigators use the grounded theory method for analysis, provide themes as well as direct quotes from the data, and discuss practical applications for supporting BIPOC scholars with engagement in open access.

AB  - We aimed to develop an in-depth understanding of quality criteria for scholarly journals by analyzing journals and publishers indexed in blacklists of predatory journals and whitelists of legitimate journals and the lists' inclusion criteria. To quantify content overlaps between blacklists and whitelists, we employed the Jaro-Winkler string metric. To identify topics addressed by the lists' inclusion criteria and to derive their concepts, we conducted qualitative coding. We included two blacklists (Beall's and Cabells Scholarly Analytics') and two whitelists (the Directory of Open Access Journals' and Cabells Scholarly Analytics'). The number of journals per list ranged from 1,404 to 12,357, and the number of publishers ranged from 473 to 5,638. Seventy-two journals and 42 publishers were included in both a blacklist and a whitelist. Seven themes were identified in the inclusion criteria: (i) peer review; (ii) editorial services; (iii) policy; (iv) business practices; (v) publishing, archiving, and access; (vi) website; and (vii) indexing and metrics. Business practices accounted for almost half of the blacklists' criteria, whereas whitelists gave more emphasis to criteria related to policy. Criteria could be allocated to four concepts: (i) transparency, (ii) ethics, (iii) professional standards, and (iv) peer review and other services. Whitelists gave most weight to transparency. Blacklists focused on ethics and professional standards. Whitelist criteria were easier to verify than those used in blacklists. Both types gave little emphasis to quality of peer review. Overall, the results show that there is overlap of journals and publishers between blacklists and whitelists. Lists differ in their criteria for quality and the weight given to different dimensions of quality. Aspects that are central but difficult to verify receive little attention.IMPORTANCE Predatory journals are spurious scientific outlets that charge fees for editorial and publishing services that they do not provide. Their lack of quality assurance of published articles increases the risk that unreliable research is published and thus jeopardizes the integrity and credibility of research as a whole. There is increasing awareness of the risks associated with predatory publishing, but efforts to address this situation are hampered by the lack of a clear definition of predatory outlets. Blacklists of predatory journals and whitelists of legitimate journals have been developed but not comprehensively examined. By systematically analyzing these lists, this study provides insights into their utility and delineates the different notions of quality and legitimacy in scholarly publishing used. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relevant concepts and provides a starting point for the development of a robust definition of predatory journals.

Wholesale use of blockchain technologies is suggested as a possible replacement for scholarly publishers. There remain questions around the adoption of blockchain technologies, including privacy, researcher support, and fraudulent use. Blockchain technologies may provide a new means of understanding problems and customers' evolving expectations, but careful consideration is required of whether blockchain is the best solution.

TI  - Book Metadata for an Open Access World
AU  - Tscheke, Nina

C1  - ScienceOpen GmbH, Berlin, Germany
AB  - Most book and monograph publications still lack visibility within an electronic environment due to missing digitalized and persistent bibliographic data and/or fragmentary portability or interoperability based on the variety of formats, resulting in a more error-prone, non-standardized communication between various indexing systems and platforms. But books that cannot be discovered will not be read. OA metadata for books is essential for the transformation of the whole scholarly landscape, and one of its greatest advantages is full, immediate accessibility. 1 The point of origin for the OA META project was the realization that available book metadata (i.e. ONIX/MARC records) was not primarily created for the usage of indexing within an electronic research environment. Consequentially, both detail and focus of elements tagged in datasets are not necessarily selected to output solidified and persistent book records. The question was how to enrich or edit available metadata so that it can unfold its greatest impact in an e-context.

IS  - 4
VL  - 60
AU  - Pinks, Anna
AB  - In their introduction to Academic E-Books: Publishers, Librarians and Users, editors Ward, Freeman and Nixon list the potential promises of e-books to libraries: they cannot be lost or damaged, they do not require staffing to check-in and out and shelf, they take up no space, they can be purchased on demand, they can be checked out by multiple users, and they are often searchable. These promises are particularly enticing when so much scholarship is done through online journal databases and when library service models are shifting from a focus on physical collections to an emphasis on creating spaces for collaborative scholarship. However, e-books also present challenges that the editors summarize in two statements: “1) lack of sufficient content and 2) users’ stated preference for print books in many cases” (2). The Academic E-Books contributors flesh out these issues through specific examples from the publishing industry, libraries, user experience and case studies. They also demonstrate how libraries are combatting challenges to successfully integrate, and in some cases replace print with, e-book collections.

IS  - 1
VL  - 62
AU  - Schmidli, Laura
AB  - Passion for digital rights management (DRM) does not typically lure anyone into the library profession; however, DRM is an essential topic for librarians driven to serve their users well. DRM is a daily challenge for libraries and their users, and librarians have a role to play in ensuring public access to information and privacy are considered, counterbalancing the rights of copyright holders. Only by being knowledgeable on the topic can librarians educate and advocate for library users. To this end, Lemmer and Wale have compiled a valuable guide on the basics of DRM for both public and academic librarians. It forms a strong foundation for those unfamiliar with a librarian’s perspective of DRM, and the latter half of the book will be engaging even for experienced librarians. Instructors will be pleased with the sequencing of chapters. They scaffold from basic to more complex concepts, and many of the questions prompted along the way are answered in a subsequent chapter. Though some chapters fall short, most readers will discover something valuable in this collection.

AB  - In these uncertain economic times, library administrators are often faced with tough budget decisions. They are encouraged to “think outside the box” for creative strategies to help cut costs while not diminishing services to library patrons. Wendy Bartlett’s Floating Collections: A Collection Development Model for Long-Term Success offers one such creative and thought-provoking strategy, particularly for public library systems.

AB  - Fundamentals of Managing Collections. By Carol A. Singer. Chicago: ALA, 2012. 167 p. $60 paperback (ISBN: 978-0-8389-1153-2). ALA Fundamentals Series. This book is part of the ALA Fundamentals Series and may serve as a targeted supplement to more general collection development works. Since most libraries still have print reference collections and librarians are struggling to integrate electronic titles with existing print collections, the topics covered in this guide will be relevant to many practitioners. Singer herself says that the reference stacks are full of useful resources, but admits to rarely consulting them. She then posits that a leaner print collection might gain more use, Her information on maintaining reference collections covers not only strategies for taming the physical reference collection, but 'also suggestions for incorporating virtual materials into that reference collection and the additional challenges of managing electronic resources. Singer divides her work into nine chapters: Reference Fundamentals; Reference Development Policies; Staffing Models for Management; Selecting Materials; Acquisitions, Budgets, and Licenses; Collection Maintenance; Weeding the Collection; Reference Development and Consortia; Discovery and Access; and a Collection Development Policy Template in an appendix. Singer begins with some definitions of reference works and continues her discussion with the electronic aspect of reference collections. She then describes the relationship between print and electronic materials, and compares these two types of resources. Singer also considers how to define boundaries for both print and electronic collections. In the next chapter, Singer provides a rationale for a separate reference collection development policy, as well as a very thorough discussion of each of the desirable components of such a policy. The chapter on staffing applies only to larger libraries but clearly delineates centralized and decentralized models for managing reference collections. Singer also provides lists of advantages and disadvantages for both models. The next topic is selection. Singer discusses some of the tools available to assist with selection and general criteria for choosing resources. She follows this introduction with specific selection criteria for different types of reference materials: online, aggregated reference book databases, freely available Internet resources, print monographs, and print serials. In the following chapter, Singer provides a broad overview of the acquisitions process, including approval plans. With the exception of a reference to typing paper order forms, the workflows Singer outlines are fairly standard. She continues with a general discussion of various models for reference collection budgets. Singer then briefly covers some of the major components of licenses. In the next chapter, the focus is on collection maintenance. Singer discusses potential worldlows when new electronic resources are added (testing, branding, cataloging, etc. …

AU  - Nelson, Miriam
AB  - Rethinking Collection Development and Management is an anthology of essays authored by professionals active in the field, broadly conceived. The treatment of each topic is highly contemporary and carries with it the distinct perspective of personal experience. This pronounced subjectivity distinguishes this volume from more directly instructive texts such as Peggy Johnson’s Fundamentals of Collection Development and Management, 3rd ed. (ALA Editions, 2014). Indeed, the publisher recommends the volume as a supplement to its more traditional textbook counterparts.1 Taken as a whole the volume seeks to situate contemporary collection development and management as a field evolving in many directions at once.

AB  - This book, the sixth volume in a series on the twenty-first century academic library, joins other books on the present and future of technical services, including Rethinking Library Technical Services (2015) and the much older Technical Services: Today and Tomorrow (1998); it presents a mixture of theory and praxis and includes surveys of the state of the profession, case studies, and think pieces. Unlike the other two volumes mentioned, it does not have chapters specifically devoted to acquisitions or to electronic resources management; metadata creation is the only division discussed in detail. However, it does include two sections aimed at technical services managers, a demographic not often treated separately.

AB  - What serials should be cancelled and what is a systematic way to do it? The Usage/Cost Relational Index identifies low-use journals and ranks the titles in relation to their subscription cost. The Index has a simple formula easy for librarians to apply and explain to inquisitive faculty. The Index Numbers are calculated on a spreadsheet that can receive subscription and use statistics by importing electronic data files in ASCII format. The Index is individual for each library and flexible in the usage data needed for the study. Use statistics may include interlibrary loan activity, exclude in-house use or have other data quirks. It is important for the manager to be aware of what the usage figures represent. Use studies can be timeconsuming and, therefore, expensive, but their costs can be recovered in the cancellation process.

AB  - When Breast Cancer Research was launched in 1999, we took the innovative decision to make all research articles open access. Open access means research published in Breast Cancer Research is universally and freely available via the Internet and the authors or copyright owners grant any third party the right to use, reproduce and disseminate the article. The benefits of open access for the research community are enormous but the consequence is that the journal does not receive any subscription income for its research content. To cover the running costs, Breast Cancer Research will be introducing article-processing charges for all research articles from August 2003.

AB  - Despite demonstrated student benefits from Open Educational Resources (OER), especially those in community colleges, faculty adoption remains marginal. This study is framed by diffusion of innovations theory, which acknowledges that adoption of an innovation must exceed a tipping point to ensure enduring success. The study focuses on community college faculty with demonstrated OER engagement, on the basis that these faculty have greater likelihood to adopt OER and help “bridge the chasm.” In surveying faculty, we tested a range of roles librarians have played in supporting OER adoption. Findings show that faculty value librarians’ roles in discovery, cataloging, and information literacy but are less open to librarians operating outside these traditional roles, including mentoring and policy development. Faculty were supportive of librarians’ role in advocacy for OER and, overall, felt that librarians have a role to play in the OER movement on their campuses.

AB  - The economic challengers in higher education and healthcare coupled with continuing budget concerns have libraries, publishers and vendors making strategic changes as they seek to provide a high-level of services at a time when uncertainty continues to dominate planning and development. Creative thinking has become the norm as organizations seek to challenge long-held views and uncover and implement needed changes. Librarians, publishers, and vendors have all experienced a period of assessment, strategic review and reaction as a result of the continued evolution from a print-based model to one dominated by electronic dissemination of scholarly information and the new role eBooks promise to play. This presentation addresses some of the important actions taken by librarians, publishers and vendors to cope with changes forced by both the economy and budget pressures, by the continued migration of scholarly resources to electronic formats and by current and planned eBook activities and new eBooks models. It explores patterns in library content selection and spending trends, publisher prices and pricing models, as well as vendor strategies and tactics challenging and changing times. Data to be presented is the result of customer research conducted by EBSCO within the last six months.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to document Hong Kong University of Science and Technology's (HKUST's) experiences in developing its Institutional Repository and to highlight its programming developments in full‐text linking and indexing, and cross institutional searching. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes how HKUST Library planned and set up its institutional repository, how it acquired and processed the scholarly output, and what procedures and guidelines were established. It also discusses some new developments in systems, including the implementation of OpenURL linking from the pre‐published version in the repository to the published sources; the partnership with Scirus to enable full‐text searching; and the development of a cross‐searching platform for institutional repositories in Hong Kong. Findings The paper reveals what and why some policy issues should be adopted, including paper versioning, authority control, and withdrawal of items. It notes what proactive approaches should be adopted to harvest research output. It also shows how programming work can be done to provide usage data, facilitate searching and publicize the repository so that scholarly output can be more accessible to the research community. Practical implications The paper provides a very useful case study for other academic libraries who want to develop their own institutional repositories. Originality/value HKUST is an early implementer of institutional repositories in Asia and its unique experience in policy issues, harvesting contents, standardization, software customization, and measures adopted in enhancing global access will be useful to similar institutions.

AB  - The impact openness to knowledge is having, not only in the Higher Education (HE) sector but at the public and institutional policy level, is largely due to the efforts of information professionals and researchers, and thanks to these two groups, initiatives such as open access (OA), open education (OE), and open science (OSC) have changed the way in which research is being taught, conducted, and communicated. Openness is a way to democratise access to knowledge developed through public funds, and this movement has been led by informational professionals worldwide; however, we have observed that to a large extent, professional development in different areas of openness is rather self-taught, informal, mentored, or continuous, but not formalised in information science, documentation, or scientific educational programmes. In this exploratory research, we gathered evidence on how (or if) openness to knowledge is being taught by reviewing a series of syllabi from undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Library and Information Science (LIS) schools sampled from universities that either (a) are leading the agenda in OA, OSC, or OE; or (b) have policies in OA, OSC, or OE; or (c) have national/federal mandates, policies, or regulations regarding OA, OSC, or OE and also from a range of non-formal and/or lifelong learning training programmes offered in these same three areas. We found that while LIS schools are not providing formal training to gain skills and competencies in openness, their libraries are offering different kinds of training in this respect. On the other hand, the good intentions and openness awareness of policies have not yet materialised in actions to ensure capacity building. Research implications aim to influence the development of capacity building in open knowledge, by providing solid evidence for enhancing curriculum advancement in LIS schools and by proposing some recommendations in this direction.

AB  - This review of 2004 and 2005 serials literature covers the themes of cost, management, and access. Interwoven through the serials literature of these two years are the importance of collaboration, communication, and linkages between scholars, publishers, subscription agents and other intermediaries, and librarians. The emphasis in the literature is on electronic serials and their impact on publishing, libraries, and vendors. In response to the crisis of escalating journal prices and libraries' dissatisfaction with the Big Deal licensing agreements, Open Access journals and publishing models were promoted. Libraries subscribed to or licensed increasing numbers of electronic serials. As a result, libraries sought ways to better manage licensing and subscription data (not handled by traditional integrated library systems) by implementing electronic resources management systems. In order to provide users with better, faster, and more current information on and access to electronic serials, libraries implemented tools and services to provide A to Z title lists, title by title coverage data, MARC records, and OpenURL link resolvers.

TI  - Building the Measuring Stick: A Model for Continuous Review and Improvement of Institutional Repository Policies
AU  - Shorey, Christy
C1  - University of Florida, USA
AB  - The institutional repository at the University of Florida (IR@UF) was founded in 2006, and the policies have not been substantially reviewed or updated since that time.As the new institutional repository (IR) manager, I set out to create a list of current IR best practices and policies from peer institutions.Once collected, this list would serve as a guide to identify needed updates that would allow the IR@UF to best address the needs of the UF community within the current scholarly publishing environment.The first step was a literature review to identify policies necessary for a thriving IR.I then compared current IR@UF policies, both public and internal, to identify where there were missing or weak policies.Evaluating the size of their IRs, years they were founded, and the types of objects collected, we identified 25 peer institutions.I did an environmental scan of these IRs by visiting their websites, searching for documentation of policies and practices.With the help of our assessment librarian, Laura Spears, I created a Qualtrics survey, drawing from the environmental scan to craft focused questions about policies in four areas: administration, submissions, collections, and other (e.g., theses and dissertations, how related items are treated, etc.).I invited the 25 peer institutions to participate in the survey as a pilot; 15 replied.Using these results and feedback from peers, I updated the survey and sent it to a broader audience, yielding 94 domestic and international participants.Some trends were easily identifiable, such as a majority of IRs being hosted on the DSpace or Digital Commons platforms, and spikes in creation of IRs in 2006, 2011, and 2015.Also present were general trends of how metadata was collected to describe items within the IR, and who set and maintained policies.Initial policies were developed mostly by advisory boards or a library department, while maintenance was primarily handled by a library department or an individual.This qualitative analysis began as a way to measure the IR@UF policies and suggest policy revisions.The results of this research speak to broader implications.It is clear the state of institutional repositories within the scope of scholarly communication is currently under scrutiny, as evidenced by recent articles such as Clifford Lynch's 2017 article, "Updating the Agenda for Academic Libraries and Scholarly Communications," 1 and "The Evolving Institutional Repository Landscape, a Choice White Paper" by Judy Luther, 2 released earlier this year.Recent surveys of the current landscape of IRs look at topics from metadata collection to the creation and maintenance of IRs in Canada, as well as the use of Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations for student works in IRs.Within this focus on IRs, understanding the policies of peer institutions is an important factor.My survey provides results from 94 participants, and serves as a case study other institutions can review based on their needs in comparison to peer institutions.The results of the survey also suggest further research opportunities into the relationship between IR platform and policies.

We then contemplate what interdependence might look like and how it might help to transform academic publishing. We end with findings from the Next Generation Library Publishing (NGLP) project (2019-2022) and its Collaborative Frameworks Working Group regarding a set of initial steps that we believe publishers, tools, and service providers might take together towards developing a collective publishing framework for open source, values-aligned tools and services.

AB  - This article reviews the contention that U.S. laws favor copyright owners over consumers, and pre-existing models over innovation. The relationship of commercial publishers to the Open Access movement is compared to that of the creators/users of file sharers and the Record Industry. The library literature bears out the contention that journal publishers have exhibited some of the behaviors that contributed to the decline of the major record labels. Librarians who support free scholarship will find the music industry plight instructive; just as iTunes fulfilled consumer demand, Open Access and other alternatives will transform publishing.

IS  - 1
VL  - 8
AU  - Copiello, Sergio
C1  - Department of Architecture, IUAV University of Venice, Dorsoduro 2206, 30123 Venice, Italy
AB  - This paper addresses the topic of the article processing charges (APCs) that are paid when publishing articles using the open access (OA) option. Building on the Elsevier OA price list, company balance sheet figures, and ScienceDirect data, tentative answers to three questions are outlined using a Monte Carlo approach to deal with the uncertainty inherent in the inputs. The first question refers to the level of APCs from the market perspective, under the hypothesis that all the articles published in Elsevier journals exploit the OA model so that the subscription to ScienceDirect becomes worthless. The second question is how much Elsevier should charge for publishing all the articles under the OA model, assuming the profit margin reduces and adheres to the market benchmark. The third issue is how many articles would have to be accepted, in an OA-only publishing landscape, so that the publisher benefits from the same revenue and profit margin as in the recent past. The results point to high APCs, nearly twice the current level, being required to preserve the publisher’s profit margin. Otherwise, by relaxing that constraint, a downward shift of APCs can be expected so they would tend to get close to current values. Accordingly, the article acceptance rate could be likely to grow from 26–27% to about 35–55%.

AB  - Part 3 of a 3-part series on the origins, impacts, and opponents of predatory journals. In 2014, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper successfully placed a “garbled blend of fake cardiology, Latin grammar, and missing graphs” into a oncereputable Canadian medical journal that had been sold to offshore owners. The journal, now possibly based in Turks and Caicos, accepted a payment of $1200 and published what the newspaper described as a deliberately bad, plagiarized study that substituted the word “cardiac” for “HIV.” The episode, if startling, is hardly isolated. Most members of the small academic subspecialty devoted to studying and tracking questionable publication practices agree that the problem is getting worse. If some shady journals are glaringly obvious, others are more carefully camou- flaged and creeping into scholarly indices and curriculum vitae alike. Efforts to curb the growing influence of these “predatory” publications, particularly in Asia, have been complicated by bitter debates between open access advocates and detractors over perceived biases, unsupported opinions, and unreliable data. Until recently, few efforts had matched the scope of Beall's List of Predatory Open-Access Publishers, a controversial but widely cited set of blacklists that flags dubious publishers, journals, and related companies. “The only thing I know to do is what I'm doing, which is helping people become aware of these publishers and journals so that they can avoid them,” says list curator Jeffrey Beall, associate professor and scholarly communications librarian at the University of Colorado in Denver. Other efforts are gaining momentum, however. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), for example, has compiled a whitelist of high-quality and properly peer-reviewed publications. Two years ago, the DOAJ overhauled its application process and required every journal and publisher in its directory to reapply. Lars Bjørnshauge, the directory's managing director, who is based in Copenhagen, Denmark, says the reappraisal came in response to requests for more vetting from funders, universities, and other stakeholders. The application's new questions, Mr. Bjørnshauge says, dig deeply into the quality and transparency of each journal's editorial process. The reviewers also conduct spot checks on listed editorial board members to verify their willing participation, especially if, as he puts it, “we smell a dodgy publication.” Keeping up with the volume of “questionable” publishers and journals has been a challenge (Mr. Bjørnshauge dislikes the term “predatory”). However, the endeavor has been aided by 7 staff members and 50 volunteer associate editors from around the world. Funding has come from academic and open access publishing members in nearly 30 countries, as well as 33 sponsors that include most major scholarly publishers (Wiley, which publishes Cancer Cytopathology, is among them). Once the vetting process is complete, Mr. Bjørnshauge estimates that perhaps 8500 journals will be listed in the DOAJ, with another 8000 to 9000 journals having been either rejected or dropped due to noncompliance. “It's timeconsuming; it's labor-intensive,” says collaborator Heather Joseph, executive director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) in Washington, DC. “But it has to happen in order for the integrity of the open access publishing process and movement, frankly, to not be further tarnished by some of the bad players.” The DOAJ has also helped launch 2 related projects. One, funded by a grant from Canada's International Development Research Centre, is designed to help open-access journals in the Southern hemisphere improve their quality and is recruiting a team of regional ambassadors to be go-to educators. A related initiative called “Think. Check. Submit.” aims to help researchers discriminate between trustworthy and suspect journals via a checklist of quality indicators. Mr. Beall welcomes the competition, although he cautions that it is too early to say whether the latter campaign will succeed. “If somebody can find a better way to help people avoid predatory publishers and what I'm doing in a complementary way, that's great,” he says. Cabell's International, an academic publishing service in Beaumont, Texas, that curates its own journal directory, is using Mr. Beall's list, the DOAJ, and more than 3 dozen other selection criteria as part of a new initiative to reevaluate the journals included in its database. Despite the usefulness of such lists, other observers say, broader efforts may be needed to counter the advance of predatory publications. “I'm not aware of a single conference that has taken place to bring these disparate groups together to try to sort out a path forward,” says David Moher, PhD, senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. The journalologist recently called for community-wide intervention in a recent editorial.1 If different factions can put aside their grievances, Dr. Moher says, a joint conference might help to highlight knowledge gaps, establish common standards, and establish research and intervention priorities. But who should play the leading role in bringing everyone together? Dr. Moher believes publishers enjoy a “very privileged position” within the industry and are the most logical choice to lead the way in organizing conferences and backing new initiatives such as a global fund to help defray author processing charges. Academic institutions, he says, also must play a more active role in protecting their researchers from shady publishing practices. The reason why we have such a vast predatory journal problem is that there is a market opportunity; that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of researchers looking for a place to publish their work. —Jocalyn Clark, PhD Multiple universities in fact have begun sounding the alarm. The United Kingdom's University of Manchester, for example, has reviewed the common practices of questionable publications and warned its faculty not to use such journals. Savitribai Phule Pune University in India has issued its own guidelines and called out predatory journals and publishers by name. The stepped-up efforts also may spur more reappraisals of an academic reward system that critics say has long pressured researchers to publish in the “right” journals, and has created plenty of opportunities for abuse. “The reason why we have such a vast predatory journal problem is that there is a market opportunity; that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of researchers looking for a place to publish their work,” says Jocalyn Clark, PhD, executive editor of The Lancet. Many are looking to do so using the path of least resistance, with few controls established by those mandated to oversee the research enterprise, she says. From that point of view, Dr. Clark says, it is hard to blame authors for publishing in scam journals if they are not being dissuaded or punished for doing so. “These predatory publishers are just seizing an opportunity,” she says. “That sort of indicts our research culture, which is so very, very focused on ‘publish or perish,’ ” she says. However, the geographical variation in predatory practices suggests that certain practices may exert more positive or negative pressure, says Ms. Joseph. “That gives me hope that a large portion of the spike and a big part of the problem can really be dealt with by asking research institutions to take a look internally at the incentive structures that they've got in place,” she says. Ms. Joseph, Mr. Bjørnshauge, and others say it may be equally instructive to dig into the publishing culture of Latin America, a region in which predatory practices have been much less pervasive to date. “Publish or perish is everywhere–it's in Latin America too,” says Renan Moritz Almeida, PhD, professor of biomedical engineering at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, who also studies scientific integrity. The difference, he says, is that when researchers cannot land a study in a top-tier international journal, their second or even third option is normally not a predatory one. Instead, he says, a robust collection of second-tier journals has given local researchers a readily accessible outlet. In fact, Brazil is second only to the United States in the number of journals in the DOAJ (it gave up its top spot after the recent reapplication process). The majority of Latin America's journals are indexed in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), a kind of PubMed for local and regional openaccess publications (mainly in Central and South America) in which English is not a priority. Many of those publications also are collaboratively funded by universities and funding agencies. Mr. Beall has questioned SciELO's quality, but Dr. Almeida says the publishing framework could be an example for other regions. “In my view, it's a successful system,” he says. Although the combined efforts have spurred cautious optimism in some quarters, Dr. Moher says significantly more resources will be required to understand, and undermine, the motives and mechanisms of predatory publishers. “That doesn't mean we're going to get rid of them all,” he says, “but we may be able to make inroads substantively.”

AB  - Abstract This paper describes a national experiment in the licensing of full text information in journals, primarily in the fields of science, technology and medicine. It discusses the initiative of the federal government of Canada through the creation of the Canada Foundation for Innovation as a new funding agency, with an objective of improving research and creativity in Canadian science. The successful efforts initiated by the Canadian Association of Research Libraries/Association des bibliothèques de recherche du Canada to create a funding opportunity to develop the ‘information infrastructure’ for Canadian researchers and the resulting Canadian National Site Licensing Project (CNSLP) progress is discussed. The evolution of a project governance structure to maintain the support of the 64 participating institutions is reviewed and the need to develop an appropriate exit strategy at the conclusion of the federal funding is also considered.

AB  - Student Journal Forum began as an in-person half-day event at the University of Toronto (U of T) in 2015. It was organized by a group of librarians with the goal to connect editors of 60+ student-led U of T journals with publishing supports, best practices, and with each other. The audience’s enthusiastic engagement and the community-building power of the event prompted the librarians to offer it again the next year, and the year after. Eight years later, this local annual event has grown into a Canada-wide virtual gathering. The shift to online during the COVID-19 pandemic was a key catalyst to open the Forum to students to connect remotely, and for the event to be jointly organized by multiple libraries across Canada. The event’s offering has evolved as well, moving from librarian-led publishing best practice sessions to student-led presentations and participatory learning sessions. The most recent 2023 Forum featured an open call for proposals that let student editors share their experiences and present on topics that mattered to them. It was complemented by a half-day of publishing skill sessions presented by Canadian librarians and two panels with scholarly editors and publishing professionals. In this paper, we reflect on the evolution of the Student Journal Forum, its successes and challenges, and its role in establishing the connection between student editors across Canada and between different Canadian libraries that offer student journal publishing support.

AB  - Predatory journals have been acknowledged as an increasing concern in the scholarly literature over the last decade, but research on the subject has been sparse. Research that has focused on predatory journals in the Canadian context has been even rarer, and limited to work focused on a single university. This study explores publishing trends in predatory journals by authors affiliated with Canadian universities.Articles published by authors at 30 Canadian universities, including all universities in the U15, were pulled from select predatory journals. Key data including author affiliation, article type, discipline, and grant information were extracted from the articles.All universities in the study were found to have publications in predatory journals. The health sciences accounted for 72% of the publications, and the sciences for 20%. Research articles accounted for 50% of the articles. Opinion, editorial, or commentary pieces accounted for 24% and 19% were review articles. Grant funding was indicated in 34% of the articles, with NSERC and CIHR being top funders. The research-intensive U15 universities were found to publish more in predatory journals than their non-U15 compatriots, even when the universities were of similar size.Canadian scholars were found to publish in predatory journals, particularly those scholars from the health sciences and research-intensive U15 universities. Grant funding was common, and often came from high profile funders like NSERC and CIHR. This study suggests that policy and education initiatives may be warranted in Canadian contexts, especially in the health sciences and at research-intensive universities.

AB  - Since their initial development in the early 2000s, institutional repositories (IRs) have proliferated around the globe. Due to low faculty participation, however, content recruitment has often posed a significant challenge for librarians and others promoting their use. Through the last decade, academic social networks (ASNs), such as ResearchGate and Academia.edu, have become popular among scholars as a means to communicate with each other and share their research. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixty scholars at six universities in Canada and South Africa to explore their views and practices pertaining to IRs and ASNs. Interviews were transcribed and coded to elucidate trends and themes in the data. The study found that few participants were active supporters of their local IRs. Lack of awareness, time limitations, and concerns regarding copyright remain some of the main obstacles to increased faculty participation. Conversely, more than half of the interviewees were active users of either ResearchGate or Academia.edu. These users valued ASNs both as a means of sharing their work and as tools facilitating connections with their colleagues internationally. Though IRs need not compete with these networks, proponents of open access repositories should be prepared to explain to faculty why they should consider having their research made accessible in a repository though they may already actively share their work through ResearchGate or Academia.edu. Significantly, both ASNs and IRs were more popular among South African than Canadian researchers. It is hoped that the results of the study will be helpful in informing the understanding and decisions of librarians and others working to develop and promote IRs and green open access more broadly.

AB  - Abstract Purpose We study the proportion of Web of Science (WoS) citation links that are represented in the Crossref Open Citation Index (COCI), with the possible aim of using COCI in research evaluation instead of the WoS, if the level of coverage was sufficient. Design/methodology/approach We calculate the proportion on citation links where both publications have a WoS accession number and a DOI simultaneously, and where the cited publications have had at least one author from our institution, the Czech Technical University in Prague. We attempt to look up each such citation link in COCI. Findings We find that 53.7% of WoS citation links are present in the COCI. The proportion varies largely by discipline. The total figures differ significantly from 40% in the large-scale study by Van Eck, Waltman, Larivière, and Sugimoto (blog 2018, https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2s234 ). Research limitations The sample does not cover all science areas uniformly; it is heavily focused on Engineering and Technology, and only some disciplines of Natural Sciences are present. However, this reflects the real scientific orientation and publication profile of our institution. Practical implications The current level of coverage is not sufficient for the WoS to be replaced by COCI for research evaluation. Originality/value The present study illustrates a COCI vs WoS comparison on the scale of a larger technical university in Central Europe.

AB  - Dissertations can be the single most important scholarly outputs of junior researchers. Whilst sets of journal articles are often evaluated with the help of citation counts from the Web of Science or Scopus, these do not index dissertations and so their impact is hard to assess. In response, this article introduces a new multistage method to extract Google Scholar citation counts for large collections of dissertations from repositories indexed by Google. The method was used to extract Google Scholar citation counts for 77,884 American doctoral dissertations from 2013 to 2017 via ProQuest, with a precision of over 95%. Some ProQuest dissertations that were dual indexed with other repositories could not be retrieved with ProQuest-specific searches but could be found with Google Scholar searches of the other repositories. The Google Scholar citation counts were then compared with Mendeley reader counts, a known source of scholarly-like impact data. A fifth of the dissertations had at least one citation recorded in Google Scholar and slightly fewer had at least one Mendeley reader. Based on numerical comparisons, the Mendeley reader counts seem to be more useful for impact assessment purposes for dissertations that are less than two years old, whilst Google Scholar citations are more useful for older dissertations, especially in social sciences, arts and humanities. Google Scholar citation counts may reflect a more scholarly type of impact than that of Mendeley reader counts because dissertations attract a substantial minority of their citations from other dissertations. In summary, the new method now makes it possible for research funders, institutions and others to systematically evaluate the impact of dissertations, although additional Google Scholar queries for other online repositories are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage.

AB  - Citation indicators are increasingly used in book‐based disciplines to support peer review in the evaluation of authors and to gauge the prestige of publishers. However, because global citation databases seem to offer weak coverage of books outside the W est, it is not clear whether the influence of non‐ W estern books can be assessed with citations. To investigate this, citations were extracted from G oogle B ooks and G oogle S cholar to 1,357 arts, humanities and social sciences ( AHSS ) books published by 5 university presses during 1961–2012 in 1 non‐ W estern nation, M alaysia. A significant minority of the books (23% in G oogle B ooks and 37% in G oogle S cholar, 45% in total) had been cited, with a higher proportion cited if they were older or in E nglish. The combination of G oogle B ooks and G oogle S cholar is therefore recommended, with some provisos, for non‐ W estern countries seeking to differentiate between books with some impact and books with no impact, to identify the highly‐cited works or to develop an indicator of academic publisher prestige.

AB  - Abstract The web contains a huge number of digital pictures. For scholars publishing such images it is important to know how well used their images are, but no method seems to have been developed for monitoring the value of academic images. In particular, can the impact of scientific or artistic images be assessed through identifying images copied or reused on the Internet? This article explores a case study of 260 NASA images to investigate whether the TinEye search engine could theoretically help to provide this information. The results show that the selected pictures had a median of 11 online copies each. However, a classification of 210 of these copies reveals that only 1.4% were explicitly used in academic publications, reflecting research impact, and the majority of the NASA pictures were used for informal scholarly (or educational) communication (37%). Additional analyses of world famous paintings and scientific images about pathology and molecular structures suggest that image contents are important for the type and extent of image use. Although it is reasonable to use statistics derived from TinEye for assessing image reuse value, the extent of its image indexing is not known.

AB  - Librarians from the Galter Health Sciences Library at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine undertook a citation analysis study in early 2017 to supplement traditional electronic journal usage data in the hopes of more effectively demonstrating journals’ value. The authors developed a methodology for gathering comprehensive publication and citation data for authors affiliated with the Feinberg School of Medicine, using Web of Science as the primary data source. Using this data, various metrics were employed to measure and evaluate journals in institutional and field-specific contexts, including co-citation networks, and increases or decreases of references over time per title. These metrics were compared against more traditional tools like Counting Online Usage of Networked Electronic Resources usage reports, cost-per-use analysis, and interlibrary loan statistics, to identify correlations and discrepancies. This use case demonstrates the potential value of incorporating publication and citation metrics into library collection development and evaluation practices.

AB  - This study examines how academic libraries in the UK responded to the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 open access policy. Thirteen information professionals at twelve institutions across the UK took part in semi-structured interviews. Findings from the interviews reveal how libraries created and deployed new infrastructures, workflows, and staffing as well as the methods through which universities communicated the policy’s requirements. The study describes respondents’ experiences of the changes brought about by REF 2021 as well as their thoughts on how the REF 2021 open access policy will affect future REF assessments. Results provide insight for libraries responding to US initiatives such as the August 2022 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy memo directing the open publishing of federally funded research.

AB  - At the University of Eastern Finland (UEF) Library, the national Open Science and Research initiative (2014–2017, Ministry of Education and Culture of Finland) triggered the planning and construction of open science related research support services. Planning of support services with themes of open access scholarly publishing, open research data and open study material began at full throttle at the UEF Library in November 2015. Information specialists were grouped into teams, which orientated to separate aspects of open science and shared their knowledge by training the whole library staff. Teamwork continued actively over the year 2016. Open science continuously brings new tasks for the Library and has already notably changed the job profiles of the library specialists.Advancing open science has been considered highly important not only at the library but also at the university level. UEF has offered resources e.g. by recruiting new information specialists and a data protection officer and internal auditor. UEF Library has a vital role in conducting open science but it is practiced in close collaboration with University Services, especially that of Development Services, General Administration and Legal Services and IT Services. Open Science team has landed the departments to share information and to discuss about open science practices at UEF. Nowadays these roadshows concerning UEF publishing and data policy, open access (OA) publishing as well as research data management and sharing are our focal operation.Work continues but the results can already be seen: In the OA ranking of research organisations in Finland (Ministry of Education and Culture of Finland), UEF has achieved level four in the five-level maturity model. Also, UEF researchers can order tailored training sessions about open research and support services from the diverse training menu offered by the Library. Updated Open UEF web pages are available for everyone and multi-channeled informing directed to UEF staff and students continues online. One concrete output from conducted open science and active campaigning about self-archiving is UEF institutional publication repository, UEF//eRepository, which was launched in February 2017. At the moment about 31% of UEF scientific publications are open access, but substantial increase is expected. The next big challenge in open research is data management and opening. UEF Library is starting to build a metadata portal for research data in order to conceive the data produced by UEF researchers and to help finding data for potential reuse.Open science will also be included in information retrieval studies of master's degree and doctoral students. To encourage students and teachers in OA publishing, during the international open access week, one student publishing master's thesis openly will be rewarded with a stipend by the Library. Department having the highest rate of OA master's theses will also be adorned with flowers.Open science is a matter of teamwork, committing and keeping up to date.

AB  - At Johns Hopkins University, the institutional repository (IR) is being developed as a component of an overall digital library architecture that will emphasize long-term preservation. The IR represents a set of services that will be developed to support the identified needs or requirements of faculty and students. Given the research-intensive environment at Johns Hopkins, one particular area of interest relates to data sets from a diversity of disciplines ranging from the humanities to the sciences. Essentially, the IR is being developed as a “gateway” to the underlying digital archive that will support data curation as part of an evolving cyberinfrastructure featuring open, modular components. In addition to this technological framework, Johns Hopkins is developing new roles and relationships between the library and the academic community, most notably through the development of “data scientists” or “data humanists.” These developments reflect the realization that the IR is the first step in a longer journey and that for institutional efforts to be successful, they must be integrated into a larger landscape of repositories that serve a distributed and diverse academic community.

AB  - Open Education (OE) opens up learning opportunities to, potentially, every person in the world. Additionally, it allows teachers, researchers, and practitioners to find, share, reuse, and improve existing resources under a dependable legal framework. Aiming to spread and foster the introduction of open policies in Higher Education (HE) institutions, the gamified interactive learning experience Catch the Open! was developed. Catch the Open! targets HE educators who wish to learn, or who wish to deepen their existing knowledge, about OE and Open Educational Practices (OEP). Within the gamified learning experience, the user becomes an educator, Alex, the game character, who receives a task from the Rector: to investigate how to best include OE and OEP in teaching and learning practice within the institution. Alex proceeds to explore and gather information in a web-based 2D virtual HE institution where students, colleagues, and guest researchers will help her to develop a comprehensive understanding of OE and the practical application of OEP. The educational content within Catch the Open! is underpinned by an OE competences framework for HE educators, developed in a previous phase of the Erasmus+ OpenGame project. In this paper, the design process to link pedagogical and technological approaches, which results in the Catch the Open! gamified web-based interactive application, is presented as well as the application itself. Moreover, two phases of piloting with 153 HE educators from six different HE institutions are presented. The obtained findings showed that the gamified environment helped in learning about OE. On the other hand, learners also suggested several improvement aspects of the gamified environment, such as the length of finishing a learning mission while playing.

AB  - Research papers can be visualized as a networked information space that contains a collection of information entities, inter-connected by directed links, commonly known as citation graph.There is a possibility to enrich the citation graph with meaningful relations using semantic tags.We have discovered and evaluated more than 150 citations' reasons from the existing published literature to be represented as citation tags.Many of these reasons have overlapped and diffused meanings.Annotating such a large volume of citation graphs with citation's reasons manually is nearly impossible, giving rise to a need to discover the citation's reasons automatically with high accuracy.The first step towards this is developing a minimal set of citation's context and reasons that are disjoint in nature.It would be a great help to the reasoning system if these reasons are represented in a formal way in the form of an ontology.By adopting a welldefined scientific methodology to formulate an ontology of citation reasons, we have reduced 150 reasons into only eight disjoint reasons, using an iterative process of sentiment analysis, collaborative meanings, and experts' opinions.Based on our findings and experiments, we have proposed a citation's context and reasons ontology (CCRO) that provides abstract conceptualization required to organize citations' relations.CCRO has been verified, validated, and assessed by using the well-defined procedures and tools proposed in the literature for ontology evaluation.The results show that the proposed ontology is concise, complete, and consistent.For the instantiation and mapping of ontology classes on real data, we have developed a mapping graph among the verbs with predicative complements in the English Language, the verbs extracted from the selected corpus using the NLP and CCRO classes.Using this mapping graph, the mapping of ontology classes in each citation's sentiment is explained with a complete mapping on the selected dataset.

AB  - Faced with a prolonged economic crisis, Ukrainian research institutes are under pressure as a direct result of limited funding. This has also had a direct negative impact on the functionality of librarians who have seen increasing limitations to acquisitions. Despite economic difficulties, Ukrainian academic librarians are trying to offer their end-users specialized services that involve active librarian mediation in the preparation and dissemination of the results of these users' scientific work. One notable function is to offer aid to users on how to detect pseudo-scientific journals. In this paper, based on a survey of librarians from leading Ukrainian universities, we studied for the first time, the main information resources and tools used by Ukrainian experts to test the validity of scientific journals so that they may be recommended to library users as reliable channels for disseminating research results. These are tools and resources include Scopus, Web of Science, Beall's blacklists, the DOAJ, Think. Check. Submit., and the Norwegian Register. We describe the benefits and limitations that Ukrainian academic librarians may encounter when each of these resources is used. Modern reformation to Ukrainian science has opened up new opportunities for Ukrainian academic librarians. As a result, if they are able to successfully implement such services, they can regain a prominent place in the scientific life of institutions and on the global academic platform.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate the challenges and opportunities of implementing open access policies in African universities.&#x0D; Methodology: This study adopted a desk methodology. A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries.&#x0D; Findings: The implementation of open access policies in African universities faces significant challenges due to limited infrastructure, funding constraints, and inadequate institutional support. However, these challenges also present opportunities for collaboration, capacity building, and leveraging existing networks to enhance access to scholarly research. By overcoming these barriers through strategic partnerships and targeted investments, African universities can foster greater knowledge dissemination, innovation, and socio-economic development across the continent.&#x0D; Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Institutional theory, diffusion of innovation theory&amp; resource dependency theory may be used to anchor future studies on the challenges and opportunities of implementing open access policies in African universities. Implementing open access policies in African universities encourages innovation in knowledge management practices, including the development of institutional repositories, metadata standards, and digital preservation strategies. African universities' implementation of open access policies can influence national and regional policy frameworks related to scholarly communication, research funding, and copyright reform.

AB  - While most challenges organized so far in the Semantic Web domain are focused on comparing tools with respect to different criteria such as their features and competencies, or exploiting semantically enriched data, the Semantic Web Evaluation Challenges series, co-located with the ESWC Semantic Web Conference, aims to compare them based on their output, namely the produced dataset. The Semantic Publishing Challenge is one of these challenges. Its goal is to involve participants in extracting data from heterogeneous sources on scholarly publications, and producing Linked Data that can be exploited by the community itself. This paper reviews lessons learned from both (i) the overall organization of the Semantic Publishing Challenge, regarding the definition of the tasks, building the input dataset and forming the evaluation, and (ii) the results produced by the participants, regarding the proposed approaches, the used tools, the preferred vocabularies and the results produced in the three editions of 2014, 2015 and 2016. We compared these lessons to other Semantic Web Evaluation Challenges. In this paper, we (i) distill best practices for organizing such challenges that could be applied to similar events, and (ii) report observations on Linked Data publishing derived from the submitted solutions. We conclude that higher quality may be achieved when Linked Data is produced as a result of a challenge, because the competition becomes an incentive, while solutions become better with respect to Linked Data publishing best practices when they are evaluated against the rules of the challenge.

TI  - Challenges in building Scholarly Knowledge Graphs for research assessment in Open Science
AU  - Manghi, Paolo

AB  - Abstract Open science has revolutionized scholarly communication and research assessment by introducing research data and software as first-class citizens. Scholarly knowledge graphs (SKGs) are expected to play a crucial role in generating research assessment indicators being able to aggregate bibliographic metadata records and semantic relationships describing all research products and their links (e.g., citations, affiliations, funding). However, the rapid advance of open science has led to publication workflows that do not adequately support and guarantee the authenticity of products and metadata quality required for research assessment. Additionally, the heterogeneity of research communities and the multitude of data sources and exchange formats complicate the provision of consistent and stable SKGs. This work builds upon the experience gained from pioneering and addressing these challenges in the OpenAIRE Graph SKG. The aim is twofold and broader. First, we identify obstacles to the creation of SKGs for research assessment caused by the state-of-the-art publishing workflows for publications, software, and data. Second, we describe repurposing SKGs as tools to monitor such workflows to identify and heal their shortcomings, taking advantage of tools, techniques, and practices that support the actors involved, namely research communities, scientists, organizations, data source providers, and SKG providers, to improve the Open Science scholarly publishing ecosystem.

AB  - This article reveals different patterns of scholarly communication in the XML research field on the Web and in print journals in terms of author visibility, and challenges the common practice of exclusively using the ISI’s databases to obtain citation counts as scientific performance indicators. Results from this study demonstrate both the importance and the feasibility of the use of multiple citation data sources in citation analysis studies of scholarly communication, and provide evidence for a developing “two tier” scholarly communication system.

AB  - Doctoral students require scientific writing skills and appropriate learning media assistance to meet publication requirements in distinguished journals. This investigation evaluates the efficacy of Moodle and OJS in teaching dissertation proposals, based on the experiences of engineering doctoral students, to provide suggestions for the optimal platform. The study examining the efficacy of the OJS-based learning model for developing dissertation proposals as compared to Moodle for engineering doctoral students revealed varying results based on the statistical methodology used by UEQ. While the Comparison of Scale Means indicated OJS to be superior across all scales, the Two-Sample T-Test established significant differences solely on a few scales. While the OJS learning model may have a higher mean value, its superiority across all aspects of UEQ cannot be assumed. To enhance student learning experience, outcomes, and the learning model itself, optimization of all UEQ scales is imperative in the OJS-based approach to dissertation proposal development

AB  - Abstract This study examines trends in open access article processing charges (APCs) from 2011 to 2021, building on a 2011 study by Solomon and Björk. Two methods are employed, a modified replica and a status update of the 2011 journals. Data are drawn from multiple sources and datasets are available as open data. Most journals do not charge APCs; this has not changed. The global average per‐journal APC increased slightly, from 906 to 958 USD, while the per‐article average increased from 904 to 1,626 USD, indicating that authors choose to publish in more expensive journals. Publisher size, type, impact metrics and subject affect charging tendencies, average APC, and pricing trends. Half the journals from the 2011 sample are no longer listed in DOAJ in 2021, due to ceased publication or publisher de‐listing. Conclusions include a caution about the potential of the APC model to increase costs beyond inflation. The university sector may be the most promising approach to economically sustainable no‐fee OA journals. Universities publish many OA journals, nearly half of OA articles, tend not to charge APCs and when APCs are charged, the prices are very low on average.

AB  - This paper describes our vision for the new UTS Library opening in 2016/17. Preparations are currently focussed on implementing enabling technologies which will move up to 80% of the print collection to an automated storage and retrieval system. This will allow the physical library to shift from a space dominated by book storage to a vibrant space for people, and facilitate better integration of physical and digital collections, services and spaces. While underpinned by technology, our new library is about people, and this paper describes the co-design practices we are exploring to include our clients in the planning process and ensure we deliver library services which meet their needs.

AB  - Abstract Nationwide surveys of researchers in Finland in 2007 and 2016 distributed with the assistance of FinELib, the Finnish national consortium, show that researchers use a growing range of sources to find and access scholarly articles and that some reading patterns are changing. The percentage of articles found by searching and browsing are decreasing, while researchers are using more social ways to locate articles. Research social networking sites are rated as important to their work. They read more on-screen, although still print some material out for final reading. Reading patterns for books are different, as researchers still rely more on printed books than e-books, in spite of an increase in e-book collections through their libraries. This study shows a continuous process of incremental change, enabled by changes in scholarly publishing, social networking, and library collection decisions. More changes can be expected, as researchers adopt systems and patterns that fit with their work patterns and make the finding, locating, and reading of scholarly materials easier. Libraries must both lead and adapt to these new reading patterns by providing links and access to a variety of journal services and by maintaining a balance of print and e-book collections.

AB  - Purpose This paper proposes describing how reference librarians in an academic library recruit content for its institutional repository, and how their roles have been changed in the process. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes the background on how institutional repositories have developed in response to the open access movement. The case of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Institutional Repository is described in detail, showing different strategies that reference librarians employed in recruiting content. The strategies include encouraging researchers to self‐archive papers, scanning web sites, capturing pre‐existing collections of grey literature, and downloading from open access sources. Findings The paper illustrates how the roles of reference librarians are changed in the process of building the institutional repository. There are extensions of existing roles in terms of system evaluation, advocacy and reference services. Brand new roles include content recruitment and interpreting publishers' policies. It also points out possible directions which can make the repository sustainable. Practical implications The paper provides a very useful case study to which other academic libraries may refer when they plan to develop their own institutional repositories. Originality/value This paper provides in‐depth descriptions on the changing roles of reference librarians not covered in previous literature. Discussions on policies, strategies, barriers and challenges will have reference value for academic libraries who want to embark on a similar project.

AB  - Innovations in scholarly publishing have led to new possibilities for academic journals (e.g., open access), and provided scholars with a range of indicators that can be used to evaluate their characteristics and their impact. This study identifies and evaluates the journal characteristics reported in five databases: Ulrich's Periodicals Directory (Ulrichs), Journal Citation Reports (JCR), SCImago Journal & Country Rank (SJR), Google Scholar Metrics (GS), and Cabell's Periodical Directory (Cabells). It describes the 13 indicators (variables) that are available through these databases—scholarly impact, subject category, age, total articles, distribution medium, open access, peer review, acceptance rate, pricing, language, country, status, and issue frequency—and highlights the similarities and differences in the ways these indicators are defined and reported. The study also addresses the ways in which this kind of information can be used to better understand particular journals as well as the scholarly publishing system.

AB  - We examine the characteristics of 663 Open Access (OA) journals in biology, computer science, economics, history, medicine, and psychology, then compare the OA journals with impact factors to comparable subscription journals. There is great variation in the size of OA journals; the largest publishes more than 2,700 articles per year, but half publish 25 or fewer. While just 29 percent of OA journals charge publication fees, those journals represent 50 percent of the articles in our study. OA journals in the fields of biology and medicine are larger than the others, more likely to charge fees, and more likely to have a high citation impact. Overall, the OA journal landscape is greatly influenced by a few key publishers and journals.

Design Linkage of random samples of predatory journals and legitimate journals of the Cabells Scholarly Analytics’ journal lists with the Publons database, employing the Jaro-Winkler string metric. Descriptive analysis of sociodemographic characteristics and reviewing and publishing behaviour of scholars for whom reviews were found in the Publons database. Setting Peer review of journal articles. Participants Reviewers who submitted peer review reports to Publons. Measurements Numbers of reviews for predatory journals and legitimate journals per reviewer. Academic age of reviewers, the total number of reviews, number of publications and number of reviews and publications per year. Results Analyses included 183 743 unique reviews submitted to Publons by 19 598 reviewers. Six thousand and seventy-seven reviews were for 1160 predatory journals (3.31% of all reviews) and 177 666 reviews for 6403 legitimate journals (96.69%). Most scholars never submitted reviews for predatory journals (90.0% of all scholars); few scholars (7.6%) reviewed occasionally or rarely (1.9%) for predatory journals. Very few scholars submitted reviews predominantly or exclusively for predatory journals (0.26% and 0.35%, respectively). The latter groups of scholars were of younger academic age and had fewer publications and reviews than the first groups. Regions with the highest shares of predatory reviews were sub-Saharan Africa (21.8% reviews for predatory journals), Middle East and North Africa (13.9%) and South Asia (7.0%), followed by North America (2.1%), Latin America and the Caribbean (2.1%), Europe and Central Asia (1.9%) and East Asia and the Pacific (1.5%). Conclusion To tackle predatory journals, universities, funders and publishers need to consider the entire research workflow and educate reviewers on concepts of quality and legitimacy in scholarly publishing.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study is to chart the scholarly journal landscape in the UAE in order to provide a scientific perspective on research productivity, distribution, and access in the country and lay the foundations for further research in this area. The study aims also to contribute to research endeavoring to paint a global picture of scholarly publishing. We carried out a mapping of scholarly journals published in the UAE compiled from international and local sources. The resulting journal list was studied focusing on the share of OA titles, language of publication, discipline, and type of publisher. Our results show that: (1) 534 journals are published in the UAE and that the share of OA is quite noteworthy with about 64% of all online journals; (2) the APC-based OA model is prevalent with around 75% of OA journals levying a publication fee; (3) UAE journals are predominantly in English while the number of Arabic-language journals is marginal; (4) science, technology and medicine prevail as the most prevalent subject areas of the journals; and (5) commercial publishers control most of the publications especially in the medical field. The study lays a foundation for further studies on scholarly journals in the UAE. The combination of regional indexes and international directories to measure the country’s scholarly journal output can also be replicated and built upon for other countries where the major international bibliometric databases do not provide a comprehensive representation of scholarly publishing activities.

AB  - Over the last few years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as the most important breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) that fundamentally transform research and developments in the field. ChatGPT represents one of the most exciting LLM systems developed recently to showcase impressive skills for language generation and highly attract public attention. Among various exciting applications discovered for ChatGPT in English, the model can process and generate texts for multiple languages due to its multilingual training data. Given the broad adoption of ChatGPT for English in different problems and areas, a natural question is whether ChatGPT can also be applied effectively for other languages or it is necessary to develop more language-specific technologies. The answer to this question requires a thorough evaluation of ChatGPT over multiple tasks with diverse languages and large datasets (i.e., beyond reported anecdotes), which is still missing or limited in current research. Our work aims to fill this gap for the evaluation of ChatGPT and similar LLMs to provide more comprehensive information for multilingual NLP applications. In particular, we evaluate ChatGPT on 7 different tasks, covering 37 diverse languages with high, medium, low, and extremely low resources. Compared to the performance of previous models, our extensive experiments demonstrate the worse performance of ChatGPT for different NLP tasks and languages, calling for further research to develop better models and understanding for multilingual learning.

Journals are attempting to become more broadly international, and doing so by adopting new digital production methods and commercial models. In light of these efforts, we discuss the current challenges to the development of China’s scientific journal industry and suggest strategies that may be useful for reaching key goals.

AB  - Abstract Over 660 Chinese researchers were questioned about their scholarly use, citing, and publishing and how trust is exercised in these key activities. Research showed few signs of new forms of scholarly usage behaviour taking hold, despite multiple opportunities afforded by Science 2.0 developments. Thus, for determining trustworthiness for usage purposes, the most important activity was reading the abstract. In terms of citations, citing the seminal source was the most common activity. In contrast, citing non‐peer reviewed sources, such as the social media, was not thought acceptable. For publishing, relevance to the field was the most important factor when choosing a place to publish. Comparisons were made with a study of 3650 international researchers, which employed the same methods and questions. The main differences between Chinese and international researchers were that the former (a) rated abstracts more highly, (b) took into account impact factors more when citing and publishing and (c) were much more likely to be influenced by institutional directives when placing their articles.

AB  - Citation analysis as one of the most widely used methods of bibliometrics can be used for computing the various impact measures for scholars based on data from citation databases. Journal Citation Reports (JCR) from Thomson Reuters provides annual report in the form of impact factor (IF) for each journal.We aimed to evaluate the citation parameters of Hepatitis Monthly by JCR in 2010 and compare them with GS and Sc.All articles of Hepat Mon published in 2009 and 2008 which had been cited in 2010 in three databases including WoS, Sc and GS gathered in a spreadsheet. The IFs were manually calculated.Among the 104 total published articles the accuracy rates of GS and Sc in recording the total number of articles was 96% and 87.5%. There was a difference between IFs among the three databases (0.793 in ISI [Institute for Scientific Information], 0.945 in Sc and 0.85 GS). The missing rate of citations in ISI was 4% totally. Original articles were the main cited types, whereas, guidelines and clinical challenges were the least ones.None of the three databases succeed to record all articles published in the journal. Despite high sensitivity of GS comparing to Sc, it cannot be a reliable source for indexing since GS has lack of screening in the data collection and low specificity. Using an average of three IFs is suggested to find the correct IF. Editors should be more aware on the role of original articles in increasing IF and the potential efficacy of review articles in long term impact factor.

AB  - A citation study of the 692 staff that makes up unit of assessment 58 (archaeology), in the 2001 UK Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) was undertaken. Unlike earlier studies, which were obliged to make assumptions on who and what had been submitted for assessment, these were, for the first time available from the RAE Web site. This study, therefore, used the specific submission details of authors and their publications. Using the Spearman rank‐order correlation coefficient, all results showed high statistically significant correlation between the RAE result and citation counts. The results were significant at 0.01 per cent. The findings confirm earlier studies. Given the comparative cost and ease of citation analysis, it is recommended that, correctly applied, it should be the initial tool of assessment for the RAE. Panel members would then exercise their judgement and skill to confirm final rankings.

Here we present standards of good practice for analyzing bibliometric data and presenting and interpreting the results. Comparisons drawn between research groups as to research performance are valid only if (1) the scientific impact of the research groups or their publications are looked at by using box plots, Lorenz curves, and Gini coefficients to represent distribution characteristics of data (in other words, going beyond the usual arithmetic mean value), (2) different reference standards are used to assess the impact of research groups, and the appropriateness of the reference standards undergoes critical examination, and (3) statistical analyses comparing citation counts take into consideration that citations are a function of many influencing factors besides scientific quality.

AB  - Background: The two main bibliometric databases, namely Web of Science and Scopus, are not available for free, whereas the Dimensions is one of the new freely available bibliometric databases and is considered to be an alternative to Scopus in particular. Objectives: To compare the information on citations to articles published in European Science Editing as available in the Dimensions to that available in Scopus. Methods: Information on articles published in European Science Editing that were cited in sources published between 2020 and 2022 was analysed to compare the relevant data as given by Dimensions and Scopus. Results: Both databases were similar in terms of the number of cited articles, the number of citing articles, and the number of citations. Of the total of 35 cited articles, 3 were unique to each of the 2 databases. Of the total of 93 citing articles, 74 were found in Scopus and 75 in the Dimensions. Conclusions: Scopus and Dimensions shared an overlap of 84% in articles cited but of only 60% in the citing articles. Information on individual citing articles strongly suggests that Dimensions takes data on citing articles from CrossRef. Unfortunately, these metadata contain errors. Data on citations in the Dimension database could be made more accurate if the references appended to the citing articles listed in the Crossref database were under an open license.

AB  - Science progresses by building upon the prior body of knowledge documented in scientific publications. The acceleration of research makes it hard to stay up-to-date with the recent developments and to summarize the ever-growing body of prior work. To address this, the task of citation text generation aims to produce accurate textual summaries given a set of papers-to-cite and the citing paper context. Due to otherwise rare explicit anchoring of cited documents in the citing paper, citation text generation provides an excellent opportunity to study how humans aggregate and synthesize textual knowledge from sources. Yet, existing studies are based upon widely diverging task definitions, which makes it hard to study this task systematically. To address this challenge, we propose CiteBench: a benchmark for citation text generation that unifies multiple diverse datasets and enables standardized evaluation of citation text generation models across task designs and domains. Using the new benchmark, we investigate the performance of multiple strong baselines, test their transferability between the datasets, and deliver new insights into the task definition and evaluation to guide future research in citation text generation. We make the code for CiteBench publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/citebench.

TI  - CiteWorth: Cite-Worthiness Detection for Improved Scientific Document Understanding
AU  - Wright, Dustin

AB  - Scientific document understanding is challenging as the data is highly domain specific and diverse.However, datasets for tasks with scientific text require expensive manual annotation and tend to be small and limited to only one or a few fields.At the same time, scientific documents contain many potential training signals, such as citations, which can be used to build large labelled datasets.Given this, we present an in-depth study of cite-worthiness detection in English, where a sentence is labelled for whether or not it cites an external source.To accomplish this, we introduce CITEWORTH, a large, contextualized, rigorously cleaned labelled dataset for cite-worthiness detection built from a massive corpus of extracted plaintext scientific documents.We show that CITEWORTH is high-quality, challenging, and suitable for studying problems such as domain adaptation.Our best performing citeworthiness detection model is a paragraphlevel contextualized sentence labelling model based on Longformer, exhibiting a 5 F1 point improvement over SciBERT which considers only individual sentences.Finally, we demonstrate that language model fine-tuning with cite-worthiness as a secondary task leads to improved performance on downstream scientific document understanding tasks.

AB  - Successful research object sharing requires that systems and users understand the structure, semantics and rules that govern a given research object collection.&#x0D; A number of metadata standards define ontologies and vocabularies for consistent expression of research object semantics. Supporting, clarifying and sometimes extending these standards are metadata application profiles (MAPs). MAPs play a key role defining metadata element cardinality and data types. MAPs may also mandate or recommend controlled vocabularies, where metadata standards have not already mentioned these in formal range declarations, encoding schemes and semantics that are to be consumed by external systems. MAPs also guide design options for in-house systems and workflows. In this paper, development of a draft MAP for grey-literature policy and research collections is discussed. A focus of the discussion is the considerations around selection and adoption of metadata standards given the research data and literature communities in the APO stakeholder map.&#x0D; This paper presents a work-in-progress version of a Dublin Core Application Profile (DCAP) candidate. The Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory Metadata Application Profile (APO-MAP) takes research object class structure as a starting point and considers class model options, especially given the availability of registry services and Persistent Indenter (PID) systems. The discussion finds that MAP development progresses towards a best fit that balances the need to adopt widely supported standards, local business drivers, and community acceptance.

AB  - The stereotype of the reference transaction is more or less unchanged since Samuel Swett Green’s day, as involving precisely one librarian and one user. There are many common situations in which the reference transaction is not a one-to-one interaction, and this article will explore those situations. Additionally, this article argues that as network technology is increasingly utilized in reference work, situations in which the reference transaction is not a one-to-one interaction are becoming more common. Indeed, this article argues that as network technology is increasingly utilized in reference work, reference work will become fundamentally a collaborative effort, to the benefit of both individual reference services and reference work in general.

AB  - An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good.The old tradition is the willingness of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals without payment, for the sake of inquiry and knowledge.The new technology is the internet.The public good they make possible is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all scientists, scholars, teachers, students, and other curious minds".That is the beginning paragraph of the Budapest Open Access Initiative, known as the Budapest Declaration.1 Most likely, no one associated with science, research, or scientific knowledge would be against these statements; 'public good' or 'for the sake of inquiry and knowledge' are altruistic terms that fit perfectly with the research environment.Unfortunately, in some of the subsequent lines, a not-so-encouraging sentence appears: "While the peer-reviewed journal literature should be accessible online without cost to readers, it is not costless to produce".This declaration gave birth to a new type of journal, the open access journals, with a business model based on the statement, "These new journals will not charge subscription or access fees, and will turn to other methods for covering their expenses".

AB  - For decades, universities, researchers, and libraries have sought a systemwide transition of scholarly publishing to open access (OA), but progress has been slow. There is now a potential for more rapid and impactful change, as new collaborative OA publishing models have taken shape. Cooperative publishing arrangements represent a viable path forward for society publishers to transition to OA as the default standard for disseminating research. The traditional article processing charge OA model has introduced sometimes unnavigable financial roadblocks, but cooperative arrangements premised on collective action principles can help to secure long-term stability and prevent the risk of free riding. Investment in cooperative arrangements does not require that cash-strapped libraries discover a new influx of money as their collection budgets continue to shrink, but rather that they purposefully redirect traditional subscription funds toward publishing support. These cooperative arrangements will require a two-way demonstration of trust: On one hand, libraries working together to provide assurances of sustained financial support, and on the other, societies’ willingness to experiment with discarding subscriptions. Organizations such as Society Publishers Coalition and Transitioning Society Publications to Open Access are committed to education about and further development of scalable and cooperative OA publishing models.

AB  - Drawing on an original methodology using citations, downloads, and survey data, this paper analyzes journal usage patterns across 28 Canadian universities. Results show that usage levels vary across disciplines and that different academic platforms varied in their importance to different institutions, with for-profit platforms generally exhibiting lower usage. These results suggest economic inefficiencies exist in "big deal" academic journal subscriptions for universities, as most journals in such bundles are seldom or never used. We recommend that universities coordinate resource sharing and negotiate strategies with academic journal expenditures based on shared interests and usage trends.

AB  - These data, from a group of liberal arts college libraries as well as from the much more scrutinized ARL libraries, raise important questions about certain articles of faith in academic librarianship.These questions relate to: the "doubling time" of library collections; the "60-30-10" division of library expenditures; the growing robustness of materials expenditures as a percentage of total expenditures, especially among the college libraries; and the phenomenon of increases in total expenditures considerably exceeding increases in major price indexes.''That most librarians dislike statistical records is patent.But without figures capable of intelligent interpretation, we are seriously handicapped indeed.William Thomas Kelvin expressed the need adequately and succinctly, ' ... when you can measure whatever you are talking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it.'" -Lawrence S. Thompson, 1945."It is essential that more be known about the present use and management of library budgets."-WarrenJ.Haas, 1986. 1 Bowdoin List data since 1966/67, a data sheet was prepared for each library, filling in for each the collection size, expenditures for salaries and wages, for materials, total expenditures, "other"

AB  - As research libraries increasingly assume the role of publisher, a new business model of scholarly publishing is emerging. Through inter- and intra-organizational partnerships, research libraries are utilizing open source publishing applications such as DSpace to develop publishing ventures. With the availability of such tools, this trend will dramatically impact the scholarly publishing system and the management of electronic journals.

AB  - Many librarians have advocated for the use of demand-driven acquisition (DDA) as an important money-saving approach in a time of reduced resources that target acquisitions we know will be used. In addition to saving money, the introduction of e-DDA presents an opportunity for a consortium to achieve three collection development objectives: continue to make the core publisher output available—and even more quickly and easily available; free up more of the collections budget to purchase unique content for the system across the campuses, not just at the larger schools; and allow campuses to review user activity to make systemwide, long-term decisions about user behavior and content not acquired through DDA. DDA can enable the consortium to meet the needs of the many right now as well as to continue to build some collections of depth for the system as a whole and the scholarly community writ large.

AB  - The Radical Open Access Collective (ROAC) is a community of scholar-led, not-for-profit presses, journals and other open access (OA) projects. The collective promotes a progressive vision for open access based on mutual alliances between the 45+ member presses and projects seeking to offer an alternative to commercial and legacy models of publishing. This article presents a case study of the collective, highlighting how it harnesses the strengths and organizational structures of not-for-profit, independent and scholar-led publishing communities by 1) further facilitating collective efforts through horizontal alliances, and by 2) enabling vertical forms of collaboration with other agencies and organizations within scholarly publishing. It provides a background to the origins of the ROAC, its members, its publishing models on display and its future plans, and highlights the importance of experimenting with and promoting new forms of communality in not-for-profit OA publishing.

AU  - Gordon, Sarah

AB  - Over the last few decades, English has become the dominant language of science. It offers a platform for communication across countries and knowledge-building processes.1 The mantra of “publish or perish” in the academic community is well known, and many are under increasing pressure to publish in high-profile journals, which are mostly English-language journals.2,3 Academics are expected to publish in English regardless of whether this is their mother tongue, or even what region their research was conducted in. As a result, non-native English speakers invest considerably more time and effort in honing their academic writing skills in a language that is not their own. While many non-native English speakers can meet or exceed the writing skills of their native English speaking counterparts, the extra effort required to reach that level places them at a significant disadvantage. In this context, your success as an academic appears to be contingent on your ability to write in English. However, navigating the Anglophone scientific publishing world can be stressful and can cause anxiety for many non-native English speakers. Academics that choose an alternative route and publish in non-English language journals are at a disadvantage as their work is often cited less and overlooked in the international community,4 but ignoring non-English literature and scientific advancements in other countries creates biases in research. Furthermore, ignoring research published in other languages also contributes to incomplete scientific understanding and hinders international collaborations on global challenges such as climate change and pandemics.1,4 English-Only Compounds Inequities The crude construction of the […]

AB  - Next to the spoken word, scholarly journals have always been the most immediate and important way for scientists to communicate. Maintaining their quality is therefore crucial to the success and advancement of the scientific enterprise. For centuries, learned societies have taken on the task of reviewing, producing, and monitoring publications for their field. By enabling publishing by scientists for scientists, they have helped the scientific community to self-organize.Examples of such societies include the Royal Society, the National Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Institute of Physics (which publishes Physics Today). Also included are the many university presses—Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and others.The society and university presses are nonprofit. Many have evolved over centuries, and each has a great tradition of reporting scientific advances and discoveries. Because scientists see the value in the scholarly publishing enterprise, they are willing to volunteer their time as journal editors, referees, or authors. Their input is invaluable in offering the scientific community a degree of quality control over publications.In contrast, commercial publishers have discovered that there is money to be made in the growing market for science publications. Commercialization of journals has contributed significantly to an explosion in their price, their numbers, and the quantity of papers they seek to publish. As a consequence, college and university libraries often can no longer afford all the journals.A way that commercial publishers have maintained their profits is to change the publishing concept from a pay-to-read strategy, which places the financial burden mostly on libraries and thus their universities, to a pay-to-publish scheme in which authors pay a fee to get their papers published. The pay-to-publish approach allows commercial publishers to circumvent quality control both for existing journals and for new journals that often have minimal pre-publication review. Thus both the number of publications—and of paying authors—and the publishers’ revenue are dramatically increased. The marketing strategy for pay-to-publish is to call it “open access.” It plays on the idea that the results of research financed by the public should also be freely accessible to the public. CYNTHIA B. CUMMINGSPPT|High resolution For more than 25 years, however, the scientific community has benefited from an effective solution to the problem of open, cheap, and easy access to scientific publications: The preprint server arXiv.org and other open internet archives make freely available to everyone the contents of articles in an increasing number of science and engineering fields.Presently, arXiv.org has operating costs, including salaries for five full-time staff members, that are less than $1 million per year. Expenses are paid by Cornell University with funding from NSF, and the operation is transparent.In physics, mathematics, astronomy, information science, and statistics, the vast majority of papers worldwide are already freely available on servers like arXiv.org. Other fields are catching up quickly.Many journals from scientific societies—the Physical Review family from the American Physical Society, for example—accept submissions of papers already posted on arXiv.org. That process leads either to publication of an improved version of the paper in the journal and on the preprint server or to rejection by the journal. Thus journal publication provides the stamp of quality from the scientific community.The refereeing process and the enhancement of a paper’s quality and readability by and for the scientific community are critical for the community’s advancement. In principle, that added value is also possible with the pay-to-publish concept, but not together with the for-profit goal of commercial publishers.A pay-to-publish system will likely lead to two tiers of publications. In some instances, it already has. At the high end, respected for-profit and nonprofit journals will ask authors for exorbitant publication fees to cover costs of refereeing, selection, and marketing; authors will want to publish in them to promote their careers and to secure funding.At the low end, for-profit journals will publish basically anything, provided the authors pay a publication fee. The net result of the lower tier will be a major problem for the scientific community and a disaster for the public: A flood of publications with minimal quality control will erode the separation between legitimate and junk science and will extract vast additional publishing costs from the scientific community and thus from public coffers.Plan S, proposed by a group of European funding agencies, would enforce the pay-to-publish model. (See “Concerns remain over European open-access proposal,” Physics Today online, 28 June 2019, and “Open access at a crossroads,” Physics Today online, 11 October 2018.)The plan in its present form has several major problems. A glaring example is that it does not allow scientists with funding from Plan S–supporting organizations to publish in the leading scientific journals. In most cases, those journals are published by academic societies. Plan S raises other concerns, too:• The plan ignores the enormous difference between commercial publishers, with their principal aim of making money, and academic societies, with their principal aim of advancing science.• Plan S breaks with the centuries-old tradition of quality control in scientific society publishing. Instead, it enforces a top-down approach that effectively promotes publication of all submitted papers. Having a flood of papers that contain flawed or even wrong research but are freely available clearly is not in the interest of the general public, who through taxes still has to pay twice: once for the research itself and again for the pay-to-publish system.• Plan S implies a redistribution of public research money to commercial publishers and away from support of the research itself. For example, a research group that produces about 20 papers per year would have to pay €100 000 ($114 000) annually for the papers to be freely available in respectable journals. That’s the approximate salary equivalent of at least two PhD positions, depending on the country.• Authors who cannot pay cannot get published.• Plan S will isolate countries that sign onto it from the rest of the international research community. It will lead to a loss of collaborations because researchers from Plan S–supporting countries will not be able to easily publish with colleagues from nonparticipating nations.• The plan will inhibit the influx of international talent into countries that are under Plan S.• Young scientists from countries whose funding agencies have signed onto Plan S will have difficulty finding positions abroad because they have not been able to publish in leading society journals.• Plan S offers insufficient cost and quality controls. In fact, Plan S in its current form undermines both cost and quality controls.A practical alternative to rapidly reduce the costs of scientific publishing is for libraries to take coordinated action and simply unsubscribe from high-cost for-profit journals. The incentive for researchers to publish in such journals would then quickly disappear. The Max Planck Society in Germany and many German universities have taken the lead on that approach; as of 1 January 2019, they ceased subscribing to all Elsevier journals. Such a coordinated action will strengthen the position of academic-society journals and will help them preserve the peer-review system and thus maintain quality control. The overall costs of journals then would fall quickly and dramatically.Good scientific publishing is led by and for the scientific community through its academic societies and university presses. We scientists should be highly skeptical about both commercially driven and ideologically driven movements in scientific publishing. Preprint servers like arXiv.org can make open access easy and inexpensive, and coordinated efforts to avoid for-profit journals can support the tradition of refereed, quality-controlled scientific papers. Ready access and availability have already been achieved in many fields; remaining fields should follow their example. Section:ChooseTop of page <<CITING ARTICLES© 2019 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Academic libraries around the world are cancelling big deal journal subscriptions at an increasing rate. This is primarily due to budgetary challenges, the unsustainable hyperinflationary pricing of these packages, and a need to move toward new open access models. It is a complex situation with many vested interests and stakeholders. Some libraries have been the target of angry backlash from faculty after such cancellations. The purpose of this qualitative study is to discover strategies for communicating to the campus community about collections cancellations so that they will better understand and support the library in making these difficult decisions.

AB  - The EU’s scientific potential is increasingly flowing into the world of new scientific knowledge. The object of this paper is the communication interpretation of the Open Science policy, covering not only access and storage of scientific information and preservation of scientific information, but communication aspects also. Purpose of the study: Establish modern trends in the scientific ecosystem oriented towards facilitating the publication and communication of scientific results. Tasks of the study: Compare new solutions in science communication models in the most popular platforms, and explore what is the alternative to traditional scientific journals. Methodology/approach: The qualitative systematic review (qualitative evidence synthesis),scientific criticism of sociological surveys, methods of analytic and synthetic processing of primary and secondary resources, secondary data analysis and overview of scientific publications available in the libraries worldwide, have been used to obtain data about the impact of new EU solutions: the European Road Map for development of the European Research Area (ERA),the European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, etc. A comparative analysis of innovation in publishing platforms was conducted with special attention to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s Gates Open Research platform. Results: The creators of the Gates Open Research platform defend the view of the rapid and socially beneficial effect of new and publicly-accepted scientific knowledge.The cutting-edge solutions are: transfer power from the hands of editors to the hands of the authors; minimize barriers or gatekeepers on the path of the new scientific outcome for society; assessment of the research not in view of the venue of publication but on the basis of the intrinsic value of the completed study; minimize the funds invested in publishing and dissemination. Implications: The conclusions can be important in identifying technological and ideological regularities for optimizing the model of scientific publications and increasing the speed and visibility of any scientific news.

AB  - Since 2009, Open Access (OA) Week has been celebrated worldwide in October each year. It is an opportunity for librarians to engage with the research community and demonstrate the value that they bring to their organisations in the area of disseminating scholarly output. Although thousands of events have been held since the inception of OA Week, a minimal amount of research has been carried out regarding the impact of these events. This article presents a review of the literature on OA Week and evaluates the effectiveness of three events held during OA Week 2015 in Ireland through the use of statistics and a survey. The three events held during OA Week 2015 in Ireland that were evaluated include: a seminar run by Repository Network Ireland (RNI), a D.E.A.R. (Drop Everything And Read) campaign using OA materials organized by Dr. Steevens' Library, and a collaborative OA seminar between Dr. Steevens' Library and Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) libraries. The author concludes that a collaborative approach to planning and managing OA week between librarians from academic and other sectors can have tangible benefits both in terms of promoting OA and also promoting the role of the Librarian in the OA movement.

AB  - <ns7:p>Although FAIR Research Data Principles are targeted at and implemented by different communities, research disciplines, and research stakeholders (data stewards, curators, etc.), there is no conclusive way to determine the level of FAIRness intended or required to make research artefacts (including, but not limited to, research data) Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The FAIR Principles cover all types of digital objects, metadata, and infrastructures. However, they focus their narrative on data features that support their reusability. FAIR defines principles, not standards, and therefore they do not propose a mechanism to achieve the behaviours they describe in an attempt to be technology/implementation neutral. Various FAIR assessment metrics and tools have been designed to measure FAIRness. Unfortunately, the same digital objects assessed by different tools often exhibit widely different outcomes because of these independent interpretations of FAIR. This results in confusion among the publishers, the funders, and the users of digital research objects. Moreover, in the absence of a standard and transparent definition of what constitutes FAIR behaviours, there is a temptation to define existing approaches as being FAIR-compliant rather than having FAIR define the expected behaviours. This whitepaper identifies three high-level stakeholder categories -FAIR decision and policymakers, FAIR custodians, and FAIR practitioners - and provides examples outlining specific stakeholders' (hypothetical but anticipated) needs. It also examines possible models for governance based on the existing peer efforts, standardisation bodies, and other ways to acknowledge specifications and potential benefits. This whitepaper can serve as a starting point to foster an open discussion around FAIRness governance and the mechanism(s) that could be used to implement it, to be trusted, broadly representative, appropriately scoped, and sustainable.

AB  - Academic publishers claim that they add value to scholarly communications by coordinating reviews and contributing and enhancing text during publication. These contributions come at a considerable cost: US academic libraries paid $$\$1.7$$ billion for serial subscriptions in 2008 alone. Library budgets, in contrast, are flat and not able to keep pace with serial price inflation. We have investigated the publishers' value proposition by conducting a comparative study of pre-print papers from two distinct science, technology, and medicine corpora and their final published counterparts. This comparison had two working assumptions: (1) If the publishers' argument is valid, the text of a pre-print paper should vary measurably from its corresponding final published version, and (2) by applying standard similarity measures, we should be able to detect and quantify such differences. Our analysis revealed that the text contents of the scientific papers generally changed very little from their pre-print to final published versions. These findings contribute empirical indicators to discussions of the added value of commercial publishers and therefore should influence libraries' economic decisions regarding access to scholarly publications.

AB  - Purpose: The “Principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly publishing” are of increasing importance in an open science environment as a way to increase the transparency and quality of academic society journals. However, little previous research has investigated the application of this new guideline in practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the degree to which this guideline is being applied by Korean academic society– published journals listed in Journal Citation Reports.Methods: The researchers investigated the homepages of 59 Korean academic society– published journals to evaluate whether they had adopted the 33 items listed in the guideline. Based on the information available on the journals’ homepages, each item was classified as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ within the four categories of basic journal information, publication ethics, copyright and archiving information, and profit model.Results: The basic journal information category was generally well-practiced, with the exceptions of the peer review process, readership, and author fees. The copyright and licensing information category was also well-practiced, with the exception of policies on posting accepted articles with third parties and archiving items. However, most items in the publication ethics category were not well practiced, with the exception of authorship and intellectual property. All items in the profit model category were infrequently implemented.Conclusion: These findings serve as a good indicator for Korean journal editors of areas for improvement. It may be helpful to review journals’ publication policies and homepages to comply with international publishing standards.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the number of journals de-indexed by Scopus during the last two decades, specifically, from 2000 through 2019. Data for the study were retrieved from SCImago, a Scopus database. The scope of the study is global, covering all the 27 major subject disciplines categorized in Scopus. A total of 6059 research journals were found to be de-indexed from Scopus up until 2019, accounting for 18.61 percent of the total journals indexed in Scopus till date. Among the total de-indexed journals, 2311 (38.14%) journals were de-indexed from the period between 2000 and 2019. A steady decline in the de-indexing of journals has been observed after the year 2010. Among the top 20 countries with the highest number of de-indexed journals, it was found that 90.11 percent of journals have been de-indexed from these countries altogether. The United States stands out as the leading country, contributing to nearly one-third of the total de-indexed journals worldwide, with Medicine (44%) being the leading subject area in the de-indexed journals. On a national level, Sweden takes the lead, recording the highest de-indexing rate of 40.70 percent of journals. Following standard publishing parameters in publishing research results is of utmost importance for several reasons, with the primary one being dissemination of genuine and authentic research for the larger benefit of society. Any compromise with the quality of published research must be addressed seriously, and if necessary de-indexing a journal as a punitive measure should be considered appropriate and welcomed.

AU  - Bell, Frances
C1  - ††University of Salford
AB  - The sociotechnical context for learning and education is dynamic and makes great demands on those trying to seize the opportunities presented by emerging technologies. The goal of this paper is to explore certain theories for our plans and actions in technology-enabled learning. Although presented as a successor to previous learning theories, connectivism alone is insufficient to inform learning and its support by technology in an internetworked world. However, because of its presence in massive open online courses (MOOCs), connectivism is influential in the practice of those who take these courses and who wish to apply it in teaching and learning. Thus connectivism is perceived as relevant by its practitioners but as lacking in rigour by its critics. Five scenarios of change are presented with frameworks of different theories to explore the variety of approaches educators can take in the contexts for change and their associated research/evaluation. I argue that the choice of which theories to use depends on the scope and purposes of the intervention, the funding available to resource the research/evaluation, and the experience and philosophical stances of the researchers/practitioners.

VL  - 3
AU  - Gray, Andrew
C1  - British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Road, Cambridge, CB3 0ET, UK
AB  - Recent research has tried to calculate the “total cost of publication” in the British academic sector, bringing together the costs of journal subscriptions, the article processing charges (APCs) paid to publish open-access content, and the indirect costs of handling open-access mandates. This study adds an estimate for the other publication charges (predominantly page and colour charges) currently paid by research institutions, a significant element which has been neglected by recent studies. When these charges are included in the calculation, the total cost to institutions as of 2013/14 is around 18.5% over and above the cost of journal subscriptions—11% from APCs, 5.5% from indirect costs, and 2% from other publication charges. For the British academic sector as a whole, this represents a total cost of publication around £213 million against a conservatively estimated journal spend of £180 million, with non-APC publication charges representing around £3.6 million. A case study is presented to show that these costs may be unexpectedly high for individual institutions, depending on disciplinary focus. The feasibility of collecting this data on a widespread basis is discussed, along with the possibility of using it to inform future subscription negotiations with publishers.

IS  - 1
VL  - 11
AU  - van Borm, Julien
AU  - Dujardin, Marianne
AB  - E-libraries just like the former paper-based libraries will become increasingly essential and indispensable tools in research and education. Library consortia seem to be the way to get e-libraries started all over the world. However, it is unclear yet whether this is going to be a longlasting workable model. The Belgian research libraries follow the international pattern and are rapidly becoming hybrid libraries especially in business, science, applied sciences and biomedicine (the STM disciplines). Still they have large paper bound collections on board and no library is willing to replace these in the near future by a purely electronic collection of journals. The fear of losing the content and thus the „raison d’être“ of the library and the concern for users not yet familiar with e-information sources are the cornerstone for a prudent, yet conservative policy. Increasingly e-information and e-journals are being taken on board. Paper and electronic go side by side in new hybrid libraries partly also due to the market policy set by the publishers in combining paper and electronic in an attempt to keep or improve the annual turnover reached during the past paper period. The transition from paper to electronic occurred in Belgium somewhat later than in other Western European countries. This confirms the position of Belgium often taking up an average position in Western Europe.

AB  - Academic publishing is a critical aspect of research, contributing to knowledge dissemination and career advancement. However, there is a paucity of standardised instruments for assessing academics’ persistence in publishing. This study developed and validated the Persistence to Publish Questionnaire (PPQ) as a valid and reliable tool for evaluating academics’ persistence to publishing in Scopus-indexed journals. The PPQ was developed through a rigorous process, including item generation, content validity assessment, pretesting, and pilot testing of items. A sample of academics (n = 262) from various disciplines across two public universities in Cross River State participated in the validation process. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were conducted to determine the instrument’s factor structure and evaluate its fit. The results from the analysis revealed that the PPQ is a multidimensional instrument with five underlying factors – persistence in manuscript preparation, manuscript submission, handling revisions, dealing with rejections, and publication delays. The PPQ exhibited strong reliability in terms of internal consistency, with Cronbach’s α values ranging from .89 to .99. McDonald’s ω and split-half reliability corrected with the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula (rtt) results further supported its reliability. Construct validity evidence showed both convergent and discriminant validity, confirming that the PPQ effectively measures persistence to publish. The PPQ represents a valuable contribution to the field of academic publishing. It offers an opportunity for researchers and institutions to assess the degree to which academics are willing to publish, empowering researchers and institutions to identify areas of improvement and provide targeted support. This tool holds promise for enhancing research productivity and quality within the global academic community.

AB  - Purpose This paper offers a “content analysis of metadata, titles, and abstracts” (CAMTA) method underpinned by a newly evolved metadata, title, abstract, introduction, methodology, results, analysis, and discussion (M-TAIMRAD) Framework. Design/methodology/approach Draws on innovations of content analysis from the field of health- care to offer a pragmatic and transparent method for conducting rigorous and valid research within the field of business and management. Findings Replicable and valid guidelines for conducting the CAMTA method are offered, including an illustration. This is followed by a critical examination of the potential applications and benefits of the method to the field of business and management research. Originality/value The CAMTA method enables researchers to assimilate and synthesise metadata, titles and abstracts as a means of identifying grounds for future research and theory development. This will help to advance the field and subsequently benefit the wider readership including fellow academics, practitioners and policymakers. The flexibility of the CAMTA method means that it can be used as a stand-alone method or combined as part of a mixed-methods approach.

AU  - Holcombe, Alex
C1  - The University of Sydney, Sydney 2006, Australia
AB  - Participation in the writing or revising of a manuscript is, according to many journal guidelines, necessary to be listed as an author of the resulting article. This is the traditional concept of authorship. But there are good reasons to shift to a contributorship model, under which it is not necessary to contribute to the writing or revision of a manuscript, and all those who make substantial contributions to a project are credited. Many journals and publishers have already taken steps in this direction, and further adoption will have several benefits. This article makes the case for continuing to move down that path. Use of a contributorship model should improve the ability of universities and funders to identify effective individual researchers and improving their ability to identify the right mix of researchers needed to advance modern science. Other benefits should include facilitating the formation of productive collaborations and the creation of important scientific tools and software. The CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) taxonomy is a machine-readable standard already incorporated into some journal management systems and it allows incremental transition toward contributorship.

TI  - Cost Impact in Managing the Transition to an Open Access Model
AU  - Chan, Gayle
C1  - University of Hong Kong
AB  - Open access to scholarly resources is a growing dimension in the universe of scholarly communication. The impact of open access on the traditional model of acquisition and access is just beginning to surface. In managing the transitioning toward open access, libraries will benefit from the model of use analytics developed by the collection development team at HKU to rationalize the value of library investment and to refine collection priorities for the future development of the collections and budget. This paper will discuss the collection building strategies of my university to tackle the major challenges in managing the transition to open access model. In particular, I will focus on the analytics employed to evaluate the use and cost impact of e‐journal big deals within an open access environment. The shift to open access of scholarly contents, which is a critical component in the research process, must be prudently managed in keeping down the total costs of ownership. The cost impact of open access must be factored into the big picture in developing new pricing models for greater optimization of resources and budget.

IS  - 1
AU  - Friedman, Megan
C1  - Biomed Central#TAB#
AB  - &gt;&gt; See video of presentation (25 min.)BioMed Central is the open access publisher who pioneered this publishing model and has been part of Springer since 2008. We launched our first journal in the year 2000, and have since seen several positive global developments which have helped establish open access as an important trend in the evolvement of scholarly communication. We have consequently observed a steady increase in awareness of open access and specifically, of our wide range of specialist as well as broad interest titles which is reflected in our growing submission numbers.BioMed Central as one of the main open access publishers has helped to establish open access as a new way of making academic research available to researchers and the public, and to introduce a change of the subscription business model in academic publishing and libraries. While BioMed Central also offers a solution for the Green Route of open access (“Open Repository”) the main part of our publishing activity is centred around our fully or “gold” open access journals. BioMed Central and SpringerOpen practise the “author pays” model, whereby the author is asked to pay a fee to cover the publisher’s cost of publishing and distributing the article. While the awareness of open access is growing among the academics, there is still uncertainty among many of how open access works and why they are asked to pay a fee. To cover that fee can still be a major obstacle for a researcher attempting to publish an article in an open access journal, as the SOAP report stated in 2011.I will present an analysis of the most recent open access developments and studies globally; as well as the effect that this has had on a number of factors that play a role in scholarly publishing, such as Impact Factors, citations and awareness of open access among academics. I will give an update on BioMed Central and Springer’s own development in the arena of open access and visibility of research, including experimenting with alternative methods of evaluating research such as Altmetric and the SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank. I will conclude with an overview of how we are working with research organisations and universities to offer financial support to their researchers in order to cover the fee for publishing in BioMed Central and SpringerOpen journals in the context of our institutional membership program.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper reports on a study – overseen by representatives of the publishing, library, and research funder communities in the UK – investigating the drivers, costs, and benefits of potential ways to increase access to scholarly journals. It identifies five different but realistic scenarios for moving towards that end over the next five years, including gold and green open access, moves towards national licensing, publisher‐led delayed open access, and transactional models. It then compares and evaluates the benefits as well as the costs and risks for the UK. The scenarios, and the modelling on which they are based, amount to a benefit‐cost analysis to help in appraising policy options. Our conclusion is that policymakers should encourage the use of existing subject and institutional repositories, but avoid pushing for reductions in embargo periods, which might put at risk the sustainability of the underlying scholarly publishing system. They should also promote and facilitate a transition to gold open access, while seeking to ensure that the average level of publication fees does not exceed c.£2.000; that the rate in the UK of open access publication is broadly in step with the rest of the world; and that total payments to publishers from UK universities do not rise as a consequence.

TI  - Country names in journal titles: shaping researchers’ perception of journals quality
IS  - 2
VL  - 129

AB  - Abstract Numerous academic journals incorporate geographic names, including countries and regions, in their titles. This practice is not uniform, as some journals opt to internationalise by omitting these affiliations. To gauge the impact of country names in journal titles on researchers' perceptions of journal quality, 408 researchers in sociology, psychology, environmental sciences, and physical chemistry in Brazil, Canada, Germany, Malaysia, Nigeria, and the USA were surveyed. The study reveals that most researchers believe that a journal's association with a specific country influences their perception of its quality (74.6%) and international readership (76.8%). Consequently, researchers tend to avoid journals with country-specific titles, suspecting limited readership or a predominant focus on papers from that country. However, exceptions exist, primarily in terms of perception, especially for American journals, which are often perceived as indistinguishable from mainstream international journals. Disciplinary variations emerge, with subject matter influencing perceptions. Subjects such as sociology, closely tied to local and national issues, exhibit a more (compared to e.g., chemistry) significant tendency toward recognising national journals. The inclusion of the term "international" in journal titles elicits mixed opinions, with some associating it with low quality or predatory journals, a perception that stems from the proliferation of predatory journals in some Asian and African countries. This study offers insight into researchers’ preferences and underscores the important role of journal titles in shaping researchers' perceptions of journals’ scope, quality and readership. In a challenging metric-driven research and publishing landscape, it is important to strike a balance between internationalisation and fostering diversity in scholarly journal publishing.

AB  - Credit for scientific discovery plays a central role in the reward structure of science. As the "currency of the realm," it powerfully influences the norms and institutional practices of the research ecosystem. Though most scientists enter the field for reasons other than desiring credit, once in the field they desire credit for their work. In addition to being a source of pleasure, credit and recognition are necessary for successful careers. The consensus among sociologists, philosophers, and economists is that pursuit of credit increases the efficiency of the scientific enterprise. Publishing results in a scholarly journal is the core approach to obtaining credit and priority, and the publishing landscape is undergoing dramatic change. As research groups get larger and more interdisciplinary, and scholarly journals proliferate, allocating credit has become more difficult. Awards and prizes further contribute to credit by recognizing prior attributions and articulating new credit attributions through their decisions. Patents can have a complex relationship to credit, and disputes over authorship and credit are common and difficult to adjudicate. Pathologic pursuit of credit adversely affects the scientific enterprise. Academic institutions assess credit in appointment and promotion decisions, and are best positioned to assume responsibility for addressing problems with the credit ecosystem. Several possible remedies are presented.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper explores the scholarly communication ‘industry’ using a product systems approach, scopes and sizes the Australian scholarly communication product system, and examines the economics behind its operation. We find that the set of interrelationships between the market characteristics of information and cost structures, patterns of demand and acquisition practices, and the forces encouraging increasing scholarly output go a long way towards explaining the operation of the system and the genesis of the crisis. Based on our economic analysis of the system, we outline broad market conforming and market distorting approaches to alleviating the crisis.

AB  - Abstract The number of scientific publications nowadays is rapidly increasing, causing information overload for researchers and making it hard for scholars to keep up to date with current trends and lines of work. Recent work has tried to address this problem by developing methods for automated summarization in the scholarly domain, but concentrated so far only on monolingual settings, primarily English. In this paper, we consequently explore how state-of-the-art neural abstract summarization models based on a multilingual encoder–decoder architecture can be used to enable cross-lingual extreme summaries of scholarly texts. To this end, we compile a new abstractive cross-lingual summarization dataset for the scholarly domain in four different languages, which enables us to train and evaluate models that process English papers and generate summaries in German, Italian, Chinese and Japanese. We present our new X-SCITLDR dataset for multilingual summarization and thoroughly benchmark different models based on a state-of-the-art multilingual pre-trained model, including a two-stage pipeline approach that independently summarizes and translates, as well as a direct cross-lingual model. We additionally explore the benefits of intermediate-stage training using English monolingual summarization and machine translation as intermediate tasks and analyze performance in zero- and few-shot scenarios. Finally, we investigate how to make our approach more efficient on the basis of knowledge distillation methods, which make it possible to shrink the size of our models, so as to reduce the computational complexity of the summarization inference.

AU  - Lammey, Rachael
C1  - Crossref
AB  - Crossref is a not-for-profit membership organization for scholarly publishing working to make content easy to find, cite, link, and assess. Crossref provides services for the publishing community such as Content Registration with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and funding data, Cited-by linking, Similarity Check for editorial originality and Crossmark for updates and retractions. Crossref has continued to grow since it was founded in 2000, and now works with over 7,000 members around the world. From these members, Crossref has indexed 87 million metadata records, and makes them available through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and search services, so that the content that Crossref members publish can be discovered and linked to as widely as possible. Along with the development of these services, Crossref has been working with the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) to help organizations who use OJS deposit DOIs and ORCID iDs and participate in other services like Similarity Check. Crossref and PKP aim to continue this collaboration in 2017 to develop the OJS / Crossref plugin so that it can support more Crossref services such as reference linking, funding data, Cited-by linking and Crossmark. This will benefit Crossref members, but also the wider research community including researchers, funders, libraries and service providers who use Crossref metadata to find content. This proposal will cover an update on Crossref services, the OJS / Crossref plugin and the planned developments to the Crossref members plugin. DOI: 10.18225/SISPUBISISPUB.23

AB  - This paper describes the scholarly metadata collected and made available by Crossref, as well as its importance in the scholarly research ecosystem. Containing over 106 million records and expanding at an average rate of 11% a year, Crossref’s metadata has become one of the major sources of scholarly data for publishers, authors, librarians, funders, and researchers. The metadata set consists of 13 content types, including not only traditional types, such as journals and conference papers, but also data sets, reports, preprints, peer reviews, and grants. The metadata is not limited to basic publication metadata, but can also include abstracts and links to full text, funding and license information, citation links, and the information about corrections, updates, retractions, etc. This scale and breadth make Crossref a valuable source for research in scientometrics, including measuring the growth and impact of science and understanding new trends in scholarly communications. The metadata is available through a number of APIs, including REST API and OAI-PMH. In this paper, we describe the kind of metadata that Crossref provides and how it is collected and curated. We also look at Crossref’s role in the research ecosystem and trends in metadata curation over the years, including the evolution of its citation data provision. We summarize the research used in Crossref’s metadata and describe plans that will improve metadata quality and retrieval in the future.

AB  - Over the past 10 years, there has been a noticeable increase of crowdsourcing projects in cultural heritage institutions, where digital technologies are being used to open up their collections and encourage the public to engage with them in a very direct way. Libraries, archives and museums have long had a history and mandate of outreach and public engagement but crowdsourcing marks a move towards a more participatory and inclusive model of engagement. If a library wants to start a crowdsourcing project, what do they need to know?&#x0D; This article is written from a Canadian University library perspective with the goal to help the reader engage with the current crowdsourcing landscape. This article’s contribution includes a literature review and a survey of popular projects and platforms; followed by a case study of a crowdsourcing pilot completed at the McGill Library. The article pulls these two threads of theory and practice together—with a discussion of some of the best practices learned through the literature and real-life experience, giving the reader practical tools to help a library evaluate if crowdsourcing is right for them, and how to get a desired project off the ground.

AU  - Auer, Sören
C1  - Fraunhofer IAIS, Germany
AB  - Significant amounts of knowledge in science and technology have so far not been published as Linked Open Data but are contained in the text and tables of legacy PDF publications. Making such information available as RDF would, for example, provide direct access to claims and facilitate surveys of related work. A lot of valuable tabular information that till now only existed in PDF documents would also finally become machine understandable. Instead of studying scientific literature or engineering patents for months, it would be possible to collect such input by simple SPARQL queries. The SemAnn approach enables collaborative annotation of text and tables in PDF documents, a format that is still the common denominator of publishing, thus maximising the potential user base. The resulting annotations in RDF format are available for querying through a SPARQL endpoint. To incentivise users with an immediate benefit for making the effort of annotation, SemAnn recommends related papers, taking into account the hierarchical context of annotations in a novel way. We evaluated the usability of SemAnn and the usefulness of its recommendations by analysing annotations resulting from tasks assigned to test users and by interviewing them. While the evaluation shows that even few annotations lead to a good recall, we also observed unexpected, serendipitous recommendations, which confirms the merit of our low-threshold annotation support for the crowd.

AB  - The number of scholarly publications grows steadily every year and it becomes harder to find, assess and compare scholarly knowledge effectively. Scholarly knowledge graphs have the potential to address these challenges. However, creating such graphs remains a complex task. We propose a method to crowdsource structured scholarly knowledge from paper authors with a web-based user interface supported by artificial intelligence. The interface enables authors to select key sentences for annotation. It integrates multiple machine learning algorithms to assist authors during the annotation, including class recommendation and key sentence highlighting. We envision that the interface is integrated in paper submission processes for which we define three main task requirements: The task has to be . We evaluated the interface with a user study in which participants were assigned the task to annotate one of their own articles. With the resulting data, we determined whether the participants were successfully able to perform the task. Furthermore, we evaluated the interface's usability and the participant's attitude towards the interface with a survey. The results suggest that sentence annotation is a feasible task for researchers and that they do not object to annotate their articles during the submission process.

As part of this effort, it may be important to clarify messaging surrounding the benefits and impacts of open access (OA) inside academia, particularly inside research. It may also be important to determine what resources and information are needed before this messaging can be effective, including showing the benefits of OA to a skeptical research community; addressing the many concerns of stakeholders; clearly explaining its pros and cons; and demonstrating the case for why the transition to OA is worth the trouble.

AB  - ABSTRACT The explosion of scientific data in recent years has resulted in the need to compile, store and globally share this research information with the multi‐disciplinary communities of science. This has resulted in research data management communities that are responsible for curating data within institutional repositories. This panel is sponsored by the SIG Scientific and Technical Information to initiate a discussion addressing data curation issues as they pertain to collaborative research data management communities within the current institutional research environment from the perspective of key stakeholders. The panel objective encompasses an examination of contemporary curation practices and data management policy issues that impact the initiation and implementation of research data management plans for scientific researchers. In addition it will explore the role that institutional repositories play in the extraction, preservation, and storage of research data while providing access to data sharing in the global scientific research communities. The panel will be comprised of key institutional stakeholders, which include university administrators, information professionals, and research scientists.

AB  - This article considers the problem of preserving research software within the wider realm of digital curation, academic research libraries, and the scholarly record. We conducted a pilot study to understand the ecosystem in which research software participates, and to identify significant characteristics that have high potential to support future scholarly practices. A set of topical curation dimensions were derived from the extant literature and applied to select cases of institutionally significant research software. This approach yields our main contribution, a curation model and decision framework for preserving research software as a scholarly object. The results of our study highlight the unique characteristics and challenges at play in building curation services in academic research libraries.

AB  - This paper reports on the results of a 2007 survey of Australian academic libraries and their practice with regard to the storage and disposal of legacy print material. The survey was undertaken in the wake of similar surveys in the United States and the United Kingdom, and with a view to assess the likely future demand for storage space. The discussion focuses on the advantages of a national print repository based on ceded ownership.

AB  - This paper explores the challenges currently faced by music cataloguers, with particular regard to their training and the systems they work with. It asks whether music catalogers feel they have enough support and training to do their work; it investigates the skills they require, and how they might be taught. It also examines whether systems need to be adapted to suit printed music. The project focuses on staff responsible for cataloging printed music at music libraries in the UK (public, academic, legal deposit and specialist). Here, the term “cataloger” refers to any member of staff who catalogs printed music.

AB  - Purpose Research support services (RSS) is an emerging and popular area in university libraries, whose increasing importance has been well documented since the early 2010s. This study aims to identify the status of RSS provided in the university libraries of Pakistan and to compare the results with relevant international studies. The research also reports on the perception of librarians regarding the application of RSS in Pakistani university libraries. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative survey was conducted of the chief librarians/head librarians working in the 175 university libraries of Pakistan. A structured questionnaire was designed and pre-tested with national and international research experts, faculty members and library professionals. SPSS was used to calculate descriptive statistics. Results of the study were compared with previous literature from an international perspective. Findings Results of the study indicated that most of the university libraries are providing basic RSS and that they have good collections of both general and subject-specific works to meet the needs of researchers. Most respondents not only were interested in providing RSS but also emphasized that libraries should upgrade their collection to meet researchers’ requirements. However, results of the study also indicated that there was noticeably less support for both the more advanced and newer research support services. Practical implications Because the delivery of RSS enables libraries to help meet a university’s strategic research goals, the findings will be of interest to university library and information science executives, policymakers and administration. The suggested recommendations highlight those service areas which are most in need of improvement. Originality/value This research provides an updated perspective on the delivery of research support services by university libraries in Pakistan.

AB  - A wide diversity exists in the current practice of transliterating Cyrillic scripts for use in bibliographic records in online catalogs. Without knowing which transliteration table was used, it is difficult to retrieve the desired record successfully or efficiently. Retrieving an item (e.g., titles or an author's name) from a library's online catalog (OPAC) where it is given only in transliterated form can be a confusing task, even for users who know the Russian language or at least the Cyrillic alphabet. This study explores the problems besetting three groups of Russian-language students faced with romanized Cyrillic bibliographic records. It also tries to investigate students' ability in searching the Russian records romanized according to the Library of Congress (LC) transliteration table. Analysis of the test results show the students' success-and-error rate before and after instruction. The findings of this study establish that transliteration is one of the factors limiting access _by Russian language students to the Slavic collections.

AB  - In Europe we tend to think of cultural diversity as the very essence of our European fabric. This conference has also underlined the necessity for sticking to internationally recognised standards if we want a seamless cooperation in the future. So I believe that presenting the Danish situation to you serves a dual purpose: that of confirming that basically we do the things you do, but we also do some things in a different way which hopefully might be inspiring. I shall be looking at both aspects, with the main emphasis on the Danish models.

AB  - Relevance. The 2022 Update of the COPE, DOAJ, OASPA, and WAME joint guidelines on The Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing encourages journals to establish their own policy in “data sharing and reproducibility” (DS&amp;R). However, this document neither provides detailed recommendations / templates nor explains the reproducibility crisis phenomenon. Objectives. To analyze and interpret the international guidelines, the best practices of global publishers and journals, as well as typical mistakes and experience of selected Russian journals, to help a journal develop its own DS&amp;R policy and its implementation. Materials and methods. The analysis of various sources (literature, reporting guidelines, data repositories), policies of 83 Russian university journals, as well as policies of the top 5 international publishers and their journals. Interviews with 6 editors-in-chief of Russian journals regarding DS&amp;R. Results. All the top 5 global publishers in their DS&amp;R policy adapt the TOP Guidelines and offer their own data sharing statement templates. Discussion and interpretations. The author suggests Russian translation of the TOP Guidelines and the main templates (e.g., data sharing statement). He also discusses 9 best journal policies and practices (including pre-registration studies). Conclusions. Numerous international sources, as well as the experience of selected Russian journals, demonstrate that the implementation of the DS&amp;R policy increases articles citation (averagely by 25.3%), the growth of journal’s bibliometric and altmetric indicators, and also contributes to the trust of the target audience. As a result, it strengthes the journal portfolio to enable publishing articles well ahead of schedule. However, only the declarative statement of DS&amp;R policies by journals without proper implementation does not bring tangible benefits to the journals.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article sets the scene for the special issue on research data and publishing. Research data – that material commonly accepted by the scholarly community as required evidence for hypotheses and insights, for verification and/or reproducibility of experiments – has become an increasingly critical issue for publishers given recent developments in funders' mandates, technological advances, policymakers' interests, and so forth. I outline some of the recent initiatives that are responding to policy directives, particularly Project ODE, and consider how publishers are working with data and integrating their practices with other collaborative efforts. A summary of the new policies, products, and partnerships demonstrates that the onus is now with scholarly publishers to gain an understanding of these developments and how they are affecting fellow key stakeholders within the research communications ecosystem.

AB  - As part of the current move towards open science, there is increasing pressure for scientists to share their research data. In support of this, several journals only publish descriptions of data generated from research: data papers. It is not clear whether this service encourages data reuse, however. This article assesses the prevalence and impact of the largest such journal, Data in Brief, comparing it with 24 other general or specialist data journals. The results show that Data in Brief became the largest data journal in 2016 and that its papers attracted over five Mendeley readers each, within a year of publication, as well as a non-trivial amount of citations. Its papers have been cited for relevance or facts contained in them in addition to acknowledging the reuse of associated datasets in about 1% of cases. Some papers describe electronic datasets whereas other papers embedded tables or images that formed the shared data. Overall, the journal seems to make a positive contribution to science by enabling access to multiple types of data, even though its papers rarely lead to data reuse.

AB  - In this paper we describe the pragmatic approach of initiating, designing and implementing the Data Management Plan (DMP) and the data FAIRification process in the multidisciplinary Horizon 2020 nanotechnology project, Anticipating Safety Issues at the Design Stage of NAno Product Development (ASINA). We briefly describe the general DMP requirements, emphasizing that the initial steps in the direction towards data FAIRification must be conceptualized and visualized in a systematic way. We demonstrate the use of a generic questionnaire to capture primary data and metadata description from our consortium (data creators/experimentalists and data analysts/modelers). We then display the interactive process with external FAIR data initiatives (data curators/quality assessors), regarding guidance for data and metadata capturing and future integration into repositories. After the preliminary data capturing and FAIRification template is formed, the inner-communication process begins between the partners, which leads to developing case-specific templates. This paper assists future data creators, data analysts, stewards and shepherds engaged in the multi-faceted data shepherding process, in any project, by providing a roadmap, demonstrated in the case of ASINA.

AB  - The possibility of open-access scholarly publications started almost 24 years ago, in response to a growing demand to make research findings free and available to anyone with a computer and an Internet connection, and building on the digital developments of the 1990s. The initiators of the movement came from a wide range of prestigious research-intensive institutions and major research funders including Harvard, the Max Planck Institute, University College London, the University of Montreal and - amongst funders - the Open Society Foundations and the Wellcome Trust. They worked on open-access issues for 10 years before releasing the Budapest Declaration and Guidelines for Open Access Publishing in 2001. Sadly, the Mellon, Carnegie and Ford Foundations seem not to have been supporters at that stage.

In the face of a changing context, the structures supporting the publication of academic books have been stable. There may be potential benefits in separating the functions of the journal in a decoupled model. Separating functions could also be applied to long‐form scholarly works, with potential benefits that are worth exploring.

AB  - Although many observers have advocated the reform of the scholarly publishing system, improvements to functions like peer review have been adopted sluggishly. We argue that this is due to the tight coupling of the journal system: the system's essential functions of archiving, registration, dissemination, and certification are bundled together and siloed into tens of thousands of individual journals. This tight coupling makes it difficult to change any one aspect of the system, choking out innovation. We suggest that the solution is the "decoupled journal." In this system, the functions are unbundled and performed as services, able to compete for patronage and evolve in response to the market. For instance, a scholar might deposit an article in her institutional repository, have it copyedited and typeset by one company, indexed for search by several others, self-marketed over her own social networks, and peer reviewed by one or more stamping agencies that connect her paper to external reviewers. The decoupled journal brings publishing out of its current 17th-century paradigm, and creates a Web-like environment of loosely joined pieces—a marketplace of tools that, like the Web, evolves quickly in response to new technologies and users' needs. Importantly, this system is able to evolve from the current one, requiring only the continued development of bolt-on services external to the journal, particularly for peer review.

AB  - In the pursuit to change scholarly communication, libraries have undertaken a number of initiatives. These may include establishing a formal program, creating a committee, or taking other concerted actions at their institutions. While librarians have been engaged in targeted activities for some time, there has been no attempt to describe what constitutes a successful program. This paper proposes that five stages that are experienced in organized attempts to change scholarly communication, arguing that the use of stages provides a practical approach to addressing a nearly intractable problem. The author defines these stages, offers illustrative examples, provides measures of success, and details strategies that support the efforts toward change.

AB  - This essay discusses the concept of discovery, intended as content discovery, and defines it in the new context of Open Science, with a focus on Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Starting from the example of Google Scholar, the authors show that this well established service does not address the current needs, practices, and variety of discovery. Alternatives in terms of technical choices, features, and governance, do however exist, offering richer and more open discovery. The paper presents in particular the implementations and research work of the H2020 project TRIPLE (Transforming Research through Innovative Practices for Linked Interdisciplinary Exploration). Dedicated to the building of a discovery platform for the SSH, the project is meant to address the specificities and evolution of discovery in this field. Prevailing scholarly resource platforms like Google Scholar limit discovery by focussing only on publications, and favouring through their algorithm well-cited papers, English content, and discipline-specific resources. A limitation in the context of cross-disciplinary and collaborative Open Science, such a service more specifically hinders discovery in the SSH. Characterized by a fragmented landscape, a variety of languages, data types, and outputs, research in the SSH requires services that fully exploit discovery potentialities. Moreover, a survey conducted within the TRIPLE project showed that most SSH researchers use Google Scholar as their starting point, and that they recognise the lack of control they have with this system. Beyond the extension of features and content, transparency is the other important criterion for the building of an Open Infrastructure actually serving the research community. In light of this, we present in some detail the GoTriple platform, which exploits today's technological potential and incorporates the best known functionalities in order to unveil more and innovative scholarly outputs and lead to international and interdisciplinary research project collaborations.

C1  - (Libraries/Distributed Data Curation Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA)
AB  - Purpose As libraries become more involved in curating research data, reference librarians will need to be trained in conducting data interviews with researchers to better understand their data and associated needs. This article seeks to identify and provide definitions for the basic terms and concepts of data curation for librarians to properly frame and carry out a data interview using the Data Curation Profiles (DCP) Toolkit. Design/methodology/approach The DCP Toolkit is a semi‐structured interview designed to assist librarians in identifying the data curation needs of researchers. The components of the DCP Toolkit were analyzed to determine the base level of knowledge needed for librarians to conduct effective data interviews. Specific concepts, definitions, and examples were sought through a review of articles, case studies, practitioner resources and from the experiences of the Purdue University Libraries. Findings Data curation concepts and terminology are not yet well‐defined and often vary across, or even within fields of study. This research informed the development of a workshop to train librarians in using the DCP Toolkit. The definitions and concepts addressed in the workshop include: data, data set, data lifecycle, data curation, data sharing, and roles for reference librarians. Practical implications Conducting a data interview can be a daunting task given the complexity of data curation and the lack of shared definitions. Practical tools and training are needed to help librarians develop capacity in data curation. Originality/value This article provides practical information for public service librarians to help them conceptualize and conduct a data interview with researchers.

TI  - Designing Digital Infrastructure: Four Considerations for Scholarly Publishing Projects
IS  - 2
VL  - 29
AU  - Kenner, Alison
C1  - Drexel University
AB  - As we move discussions around publishing forward and adopt open-access models, social scientists need to consider how digital infrastructure opens and closes possibilities for scholarly production and engagement. Attention to changes in publishing infrastructure—which, like most infrastructure, is often rendered invisible—is needed, not only because it allows us to make sense of socio-technical transitions at various scales and for differently invested communities, but because we need more informed participants, users who can question the system in ways that make it more robust. This essay suggests that digital infrastructure design and development should be organized around (1) platform affordances, (2) support for labor, (3) emerging circulation practices, and (4) opportunities for collaboration. By tracing the long-term socio-technical work that made it possible for Cultural Anthropology to go open access earlier this year, this essay works to make visible some behind-the-scenes details to be considered when thinking about the future of scholarly publishing.

AB  - Most work on scholarly document processing assumes that the information processed is trust-worthy and factually correct. However, this is not always the case. There are two core challenges, which should be addressed: 1) ensuring that scientific publications are credible – e.g. that claims are not made without supporting evidence, and that all relevant supporting evidence is provided; and 2) that scientific findings are not misrepresented, distorted or outright misreported when communicated by journalists or the general public. I will present some first steps towards addressing these problems and outline remaining challenges.

AB  - Over the last twenty years, library publishing has emerged in higher education as a new class of publisher. Conceived as a response to commercial publishing practices that have strained library budgets and prevented scholars from openly licensing and sharing their works, library publishing is both a local service program and a broader movement to disrupt the current scholarly publishing arena. It is growing both in numbers of publishers and numbers of works produced. The commercial publishing framework which determines the viability of monetizing a product is not necessarily applicable for library publishers who exist as a common good to address the needs of their academic communities. Like any business venture, however, library publishers must develop a clear service model and business plan in order to create shared expectations for funding streams, quality markers, as well as technical and staff capacity. As the field is maturing from experimental projects to full programs, library publishers are formalizing their offerings and limitations. The anatomy of a library publishing business plan is presented and includes the principles of the program, scope of services, and staffing requirements. Other aspects include production policies, financial structures, and measures of success.

AB  - Flexible learning increases access to higher education, particularly for traditionally undeserved students. First-time entrants, who may lack the cultural capital to be successful, may also be more likely to participate in flexible learning than traditional students, and particularly in online and blended courses. We posit that success for all students enrolling in flexible forms of learning can be achieved through course design and responsive pedagogies. For these efforts to be successful, competency frameworks must be developed, and initial and ongoing training provided for teaching staff. This paper discusses a theory-based and practice-informed framework for the scalable expansion of flexible learning, which in our case, encompassed online learning, blended learning, competency-based education, and open educational resources. We provide a context for the framework, introduce the framework, discuss the steps for developing and implementing it, and share initial findings and implications.

AB  - An output of the Data policy standardisation and implementation Interest Group (IG) of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) More journals and publishers – and funding agencies and institutions – are introducing research data policies. But as the prevalence of policies increases, there is potential to confuse researchers and support staff with numerous or conflicting policy requirements. We define and describe 14 features of journal research data policies and arrange these into a set of six standard policy types or tiers, which can be adopted by journals and publishers to promote data sharing in a way that encourages good practice and is appropriate for their audience's perceived needs. Policy features include coverage of topics such as data citation, data repositories, data availability statements, data standards and formats, and peer review of research data. These policy features and types have been created by reviewing the policies of multiple scholarly publishers, which collectively publish more than 10,000 journals, and through discussions and consensus building with multiple stakeholders in research data policy via the Data Policy Standardisation and Implementation Interest Group of the Research Data Alliance. Implementation guidelines for the standard research data policies for journals and publishers are also provided, along with template policy texts which can be implemented by journals in their Information for Authors and publishing workflows. We conclude with a call for collaboration across the scholarly publishing and wider research community to drive further implementation and adoption of consistent research data policies. <strong>Publisher's Note:</strong> a correction article relating to this publication has been published and can be found at <a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-017">http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-017</a>

AB  - Scholarly communication librarianship is a messy field. Its margins are ill-defined and ever- changing. There is a lack of curricular training in library schools and a lack of opportunities for early-career candidates. As a result, preparing librarians for a scholarly communication career presents a challenge. In this piece I discuss this messiness and describe my personal experiences in a residency position, showing how these kinds of positions support the professional development of scholarly communication librarians, with specific reference to the NASIG Core Competencies for scholarly communication librarians.

AB  - In order to create a transparent and sound academic communication ecosystem centered on researchers, we developed a system that applied blockchain technology to an open peer review system. In this study, an open peer review system was developed based on Hyperledger Fabric, which is a private blockchain. The system can be operated in connection with the reviewer recommendation module of the existing submission management system. In the reviewer recommendation module, reviewers are recommended by excluding co-authors and colleagues after an expertise test. The blockchain system performs an open peer review process based on smart contracts, while the submission management system selects reviewers for peer review. A service broker intervenes between these two systems for data interchange. The system developed herein is expected to be used as a researcher-centered scholarly communication model in the open science era, in which the intervention of publishers is minimized, and authors and reviewers (as researchers) are centered.

AB  - Open access (OA) publication has emerged, with disruptive effects, as a major outlet for scholarly publication. OA publication is usually associated with on-line distribution and provides access to scholarly publications to anyone, anywhere–regardless of their ability to pay subscription fees or their association with an educational institution. The article overviews the growth and impact of OA publication in Canada and elsewhere. The article also presents a case study of the evolution over its first nine years of the International Review of Research in Open and Distance Education (IRRODL). IRRODL has become the most widely read and widely cited journal in the distance education and open learning community, yet it continues to struggle for recognition by some academics, funding, and rating organizations.&#x0D; In this article IRRODL’s editors document the challenges involved in leading the charge for equal support for open access journals from Canada’s research funding organizations and for review and accreditation from commercial and non-commercial review services. In its literature review section the article looks at scholarly works documenting and comparing on-line journals to ones that publish in paper only, or in which access is restricted behind the walls of licensed use.&#x0D; &#x0D; The article also documents issues related to various innovations, including production of articles in both text and audio formats, and the challenges of incorporating more interactive media into a scholarly, peer- reviewed journal. Data is produced demonstrating the ways in which 72 CJHE / RCES Volume 39, No. 3, 2009 influence and impact for open access journals can be measured, including hit rates and citations reference data from Google Scholar. The article concludes with a description and discussion of the advantages and challenges of using review and publication management tools such as Open Journal System in the production of open access journals.&#x0D;

AB  - The first ever quantitative paper to claim that papers published in so-called “predatory” open access (OA) journals and publishers were financially remunerated emerged from Canada. That study, published in the Journal of Scholarly Publishing (University of Toronto Press) in 2017 by Derek Pyne at Thompson Rivers University, garnered wide public and media attention, even by renowned news outlets such as The New York Times and The Economist. Pyne claimed to have found that most of the human subjects of his study had published in “predatory” OA journals, or in OA journals published by “predatory” OA publishers, as classified by Jeffrey Beall. In this paper, we compare the so-called “predatory” publications referred to in Pyne’s study with Walt Crawford’s gray open access (grayOA) list, as well as with Cabell’s blacklist, which was introduced in 2017. Using Cabell’s blacklist and Crawford’s grayOA list, we found that approximately 2% of the total publications (451) of the research faculty at the small business school were published in potentially questionable journals, contrary to the Pyne study, which found significantly more publications (15.3%). In addition, this research casts doubt to the claim made in Pyne’s study that research faculty members who have predatory publications have 4.3 “predatory” publications on average.

Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews the profitability of commercial publishers and their plans for expansion in the digital book market, and contrasts this with the continued financial hardships of public‐welfare academic publishers. Findings The problems for non‐profit academic publishers will not be solved by simply “going digital”. Practical implications Librarians need to exclude small academic publishers from further burdening through collective collection development. Originality/value The paper reviews developments in digital book publication from the perspective of a 1997 conference on the “crisis” in academic publishing with current business practices and expansions by large publishing houses.

AB  - Introduction: Pacific University Libraries has had an institutional repository since 2009, when it selected Digital Commons to host a collection of theses and dissertations. Since then, the scope of the services has grown to include publishing open access journals as well as housing the books published by Pacific University Press—a library-born, hybrid, open access press. As our needs have changed, and with Elsevier’s acquisition of bepress in 2017, the University migrated from bepress’ Digital Commons platform to an open source Hyku platform hosted by Ubiquity Repositories. Description of Program: As the first academic institution working with Ubiquity Repositories on migration and implementation, we were involved in the process of data extraction, normalization, mapping, ingest, and validation. Lessons Learned: We learned the importance of having a mutual understanding of a platform’s goals, data structure and mapping, and standards in implementation decisions. Next Steps: As higher education continues to adapt to the changes brought by COVID-19, it has never seemed more important to utilize platforms that share the values of libraries worldwide. We hope that migrating to an open source platform will be a step toward more open scholarship, despite the current challenges and resource scarcity brought about by the pandemic.

AB  - This slim, easily read volume is a compilation of papers presented at a conference, “Digital Information and Knowledge Management: New Opportunities for Research Libraries,” sponsored by the University of Oklahoma Libraries and held March 3–4, 2005, in Oklahoma City. As such, it provides a snapshot of the thinking at that time about these topics and features glimpses of opportunities for libraries in the twenty-first century.Keynote speaker Kaufman provides an overview of where libraries have been and where they are heading. Her advice to those working in this transformed future is to make choices that will help research libraries integrate themselves into the fabric of university life and research. Dillon asserts, “the future of libraries is likely to be where it has always been, in providing a particular community with value-added information services that they cannot get elsewhere” (p. 39) by focusing on and promoting what they do and do well. By comparing two digital library projects, Panitch and Michalak emphasize the need for research libraries to focus on performing work of a scholarly nature in this arena. Baker shares information about projects, both successful and not, so that research librarians can continue their long tradition of collaboration to make future changes. She suggests that in general librarians are ahead of the curve compared to their faculty when it comes to seeing the need to change how information and knowledge are handled and disseminated. Cullen warns of the dangers of simply being overwhelmed by the rapid increase of information and challenges readers to take measures that make it useful to others. What new skills and experiences will librarians of the future need? Baker answers this question in her paper. The final chapter by Shirk describes ways the tools for visualizing information might be applied by librarians to create an improved map of library collections.Much has changed since the 2005 conference that serves as the basis of this book. Libraries, for example, are in partnership with Google to better organize and retrieve digital information. New tools in the area of social networking are being applied daily in libraries as research librarians reach out to their users and meet them in their spaces, thus integrating themselves into the campus fabric. This book provides an excellent historical overview of the issues and concerns of research librarians around digital information and knowledge management. After reading it, those wishing to learn about current applications and challenges should consult the journal literature.

AB  - AbstractThe authors analyze the issues that the Michigan Molecular Institute Library (MMI) will face in the transition from print to digital serials. The library supports a specialized research institute with sixty-eight serial subscriptions from forty-two publishers. Its specialized nature limits the number of potential consortia partners. Strengths include a user community of skilled researchers in a well-defined research area. In this transition, MMI will encounter both similar and different issues than those found in larger academic and research libraries. Topics include current access, planning, licensing, archival concerns, interlibrary loan (ILL), interoperability, and emerging trends. The authors recommend that the MMI librarian periodically evaluate the collection strategy in keeping with changing trends. AcknowledgementsThe following article is the result of a study by Natalie A. Tucker, a student in the Wayne State University Library & Information Science Program, under the direction of Robert P.

AB  - Digital libraries and the Web have brought enormously powerful search mechanisms to the desktops of many researchers.With the use of insights from cultural studies and the history and philosophy of science, it is argued that one likely outcome is a change in the acceptable standards for literature reviews, leading to changes in article contents to reflect a broader academic basis.As a result, researchers should be trained to read and evaluate material from a much wider range of subjects than previously necessary.The broadening base may impact science and non-science subjects differently.

C1  - D‐Lib Magazine
AB  - This article is based on a keynote address given at the ACM Digital Libraries '99 conference, held in Berkeley, CA, in August 1999. It is reprinted with slight modifications by the kind permission of the author and the publisher from D-Lib Magazine , v. 6, no. 1 (January 2000). "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" Alice asks the Cheshire Cat who is perched on the bough of a tree. "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," is the cat's saucy reply. Which way ought we to go in digital library research and development? This too depends on where we want to get to. But in this case who is we ? Where are we trying to get to? And how have we come to decide that this where (whatever it is) is where we ought to be? These are the millennial, the big picture questions I want to pose to the digital library community as the calendar turns. My hope, as the title of these remarks suggests, is to introduce and reflect on the problem of purpose in digital libraries. The term is due to Patrick Williams, who in The American Public Library and the Problem of Purpose [4], documents the various attempts of American public libraries over the past nearly 150 years to identify and solidify their purpose – to figure out where they were trying to get to. I'll start by reviewing the problem of purpose in American public libraries and American academic/research libraries before turning to digital libraries. The first American public library, in Boston, was inaugurated in 1854 with a strong statement of purpose: "Why should not this prosperous and liberal city extend some reasonable amount of aid to the foundation and support of a noble public library, to which the young people of both sexes, when they leave the schools, can resort for those works which pertain to general culture, or which are needful for research into any branch of knowledge? . . . We consider that a large public library is of the utmost importance as the means of completing our system of public education . . ." Other public libraries were soon created in this image; by 1875 nearly 200 public libraries had been established and even more were being planned. Their mission was clear: to serve as a new kind of educational institution, an adjunct to the public school, which would provide citizens with ongoing opportunities to learn after they had completed their formal schooling. There was just one problem with this noble purpose: patrons of the libraries seemed more interested in reading popular literature (mainly fiction) than the "serious" works (history, biography, science) that educators of the time thought would lead to moral and intellectual growth. Librarians comforted themselves by inventing a "taste-elevation theory." Even if patrons came to the library in search of fiction, they would eventually move on to works of greater merit. But by the 1890s the taste-elevation theory had been largely abandoned. People still wanted popular fiction, and there was no evidence that they were cultivating a taste for more cultured works. As the taste-elevation theory lost adherents, the debate grew about what to do: Exclude inferior fiction? Accept entertainment as having social value? Permit whatever the public wanted? It came to be accepted that public libraries should supply readers with what they wanted, entertainment mostly. But this meant that the original stated purpose of the public library, to be an educational institution on a par with the public schools, to provide "self-culture through books," would have to be abandoned. This was only the first in a series of discouragements as public libraries invented or discovered new purposes only to abandon them once they were found to be wrong or inadequate. Around the turn of the century, a time of rapidly changing social conditions, librarians re-envisioned themselves as "missionaries of literature," teaching the American way of life. Enlivened by "the library spirit," a faith in the transformative potential of reading, librarians set forth to "evangelize, reform, and save." The outbreak of World War I put an end to this vision. "Librarians cannot prevent the breakdown of civilization," one prominent librarian said in 1913. Other missions followed, some of them seeming like vaguely recycled versions of previous attempts: the public library as an all-purpose information center, as a community center, as a center for adult education, as the guardian of free speech – all with limited success. It wasn't until the 1980s, Williams claims, that public libraries finally began to come to terms with their more limited but realistic purpose: to be suppliers of books to the middle class and a symbol of culture in the community. Williams' book was published in 1988, however, too early to see that the Internet would once again challenge the public library's sense of purpose or to see libraries trying to fashion themselves into portals onto the information superhighway. For much of their history, by contrast, academic and research libraries have lived with a happier and more successful sense of purpose. The modern academic library, like the public library, was a product of the 19th century. But unlike the public library, it was lucky enough to inherit a purpose from the larger institution within which it was created. As Stanley Chodorow and Peter Lyman explain [2], the modern university defined itself as "an instrument for social progress," and scholarship as "the production of specialized publication." With this understanding, the university took upon itself an obligation "to collect and organize the information that its faculty and students needed for their work." A division of responsibility was worked out between faculty, academic presses and academic libraries. The faculty would be the producers and, along with students, the consumers of scholarly information. The academic presses would produce physical volumes – books and journals – while assuring the quality of the intellectual content. Academic libraries would take responsibility for purchasing, organizing, preserving and providing access to scholarly information. This worked reasonably well until, in the last decade or two, the cost of journal subscriptions offered by commercial publishers began to spiral out of control. In the face of rising prices, academic libraries began to prune their subscriptions, and in response to lost subscriptions, journal publishers raised their subscription prices even higher. At the same time, higher journal prices left libraries with less money to spend on monographs, so these collections began to suffer as well. The result was a crisis of purpose which still hasn't been resolved: How can academic and research libraries continue to fulfill their original purpose – to collect, organize and provide access to scholarly information – when they can't afford to acquire it? All this took place before the Internet exploded onto the scene. But now, in an increasingly wired world, it is possible that universities may be able to take back control of scholarly information. By working with scholarly societies to create their own online journals they may be able to cut commercial publishers out of the loop. While this holds out some hope for resolving the crisis in scholarly publishing, it doesn't necessarily help libraries, which also risk being cut out of the loop. Even worse, digital developments may challenge academic libraries even more fundamentally. What happens to the very idea of the university in an age in which distance learning is not only conceivable but seemingly practical? And what role is there, if any, for academic libraries when so much information is becoming available on the Web? As many observers have pointed out, the term digital library means different things to different people. For librarians, the word library conjures up an institution that manages one or more collections. For computer scientists, the institutional aspect plays a minor role, if any. Instead, this group is more likely to focus on the collections themselves – digital collections – and on the enabling technologies through which these collections are built and searched. Do digital libraries now, or will they eventually, suffer a problem of purpose? It might seem hard to imagine such a possibility, especially at a time of such enormous expansion and optimism in the digital realm. But I want to suggest that the problem of purpose deserves our further attention and that attending to it can actually help chart an expanded and more focused research agenda for digital libraries. At first, it might seem that purpose is simply irrelevant to digital libraries. Especially if we think of them as enabling technologies with which to create and manage collections of digital materials, then digital libraries would seem to be purpose-neutral. But this simply shifts the problem of purpose from the technologies, per se, to the collections and the institutions that manage them. We're still left needing to say something about the purpose(s) of these institutions and their collections. And if we should choose to argue that digital libraries can be all things to all people, we ought at least to pay attention to public libraries, which tried that route and failed. Purpose, however, clearly is relevant to digital libraries, in whatever way we conceive of them. Indeed, I would argue that researchers and funders currently have a shared purpose, a mission, which stretches from research and development through to the greater good of humankind and provides psychic energy and justification for the current research agenda. This mission, which might be called the digital library faith, is an almost evangelical belief that digital materials are right and good. I think it goes something like this: Why are we doing digital library research and development? To put digital materials online so they can be found and used. And why are we doing this? To make these materials more broadly, quickly and efficiently accessible. Why? Because information is good, so more information is better. Why? For the sake of democracy, education, the advancement of science and technology. Why? For the sake of the "good life": freedom, health, ethical conduct, wisdom, well-being. It would seem hard to argue with a statement of purpose as well-intentioned and self-evidently good as this. It has the aura of Mom and apple pie, truth and justice, and the American Way. Still, I think it has its difficulties and deserves to be debated and fine-tuned. Here are three directions for further exploration. First, although it is implicit in my formulation of the digital library faith, many members of the community believe that we are headed for, and should be headed for, an all-digital world. One has only to look at the current research agenda in the large to see a near total emphasis on managing all-digital collections. But "all-digital, all the time" is an article of faith. It may ultimately come to pass, but like the various apocalyptic prophesies which run wild at a time like ours, it simply isn't supported by the current facts. Ethnographic studies of actual workplaces reveal the diverse mix of materials, digital and otherwise, commonly in use and offer no suggestion that this diversity is diminishing. By hewing to an agenda enlivened by this faith, I believe we are missing some important research opportunities, such as integrating heterogeneous (digital and non-digital) collections and providing tools to organize and search them. Second, our almost religious belief in the power of information deserves to be examined. Is more information always better? Surely not. Just look at the growing concern over invasion of privacy as online services are collecting more and more information about consumers. Or the glut of junk mail and, now, spam. In such cases fixes can be envisioned, part technological, part social and political. But other criticisms of our current information focus may not be so easily addressed. Albert Borgmann, for example, a philosopher of technology, has been arguing that a steady diet of high tech information resources, of travels in cyberspace, risks distorting our relationship to reality, depriving us of other, much needed sources of wisdom (our bodies, our relationship to the earth, silence). "Information," he claims in his latest book, Holding On to Reality [1], "is about to overflow and suffocate reality." Surely, if more information isn't always better, then the link between information and the good life deserves closer attention. My third point has less to do with the particulars of the digital library faith than with the communities that have been shaping it. In her cultural and architectural history, Free to All: Carnegie Libraries and American Culture, 1890-1920 [3], Abigail Van Slyck argues that each public library funded through Andrew Carnegie's philanthropy was the product of interactions among multiple, local constituencies. "Carnegie libraries," she says, "stood on contested ground. Despite their strong family resemblance, they were not the unselfconscious expression of a unified American spirit. Instead, they were always cultural artifacts whose meanings varied with the intentions and experiences of a diverse group of users." Librarians, architects, the members of the town council (who were men) and the women of the community all brought different perspectives to bear. Under such circumstances of conflicting perspectives and objectives, even Carnegie's money wasn't powerful enough to determine how each library would be realized. Slyck's somewhat surprising conclusion is that "ultimately, Carnegie's importance lay in initiating substantive discussion about the role that culture should play in modern America." The current digital library agenda has largely been set by the computer science community and clearly bears the imprint of this community's interests and vision. But there are other constituencies whose voices need to be heard. We have an opportunity, as yet unrealized, to debate our purposes with a broader spectrum of the population whose lives will be affected by the work we do. Social scientists, for example, have much to say about the relationship between technological development and the societal benefits that might accrue from it. To date, however, the social science work within digital library R&D has largely been defined as, and confined to, evaluating prototypes developed by computer scientists. Then too, stronger participation from the traditional library community seems essential. And had it been available earlier, such participation might have helped us avoid the most glaring omission of the first decade of digital library research and development: the lack of attention to preservation. It is only in the last few years that the enormity of the preservation problem has begun to become generally known, and research that might help resolve it is still very much in its infancy. For roughly a decade we have been rushing to put materials online with no thought to (and no idea of how to) preserve them. One consequence is that, almost certainly, there will be a hole in history: the early history of the Web will have been missed. Surely, this must count as an illustration of how narrowness of vision can take its toll and how more explicit attention to societal purposes can help expand and tune a research agenda. Libraries, digital or otherwise, carry a strong symbolic charge. On the face of it, they are just one element in the larger circuit through which information travels from production to ultimate consumption. In this respect, they are on a par with the other elements in the circuit: authors, publishers, distributors and communities of users. But libraries have come to symbolize and to exemplify the values we impute to the entire circuit. What we say about digital libraries and how we understand them embodies and signals our attitude toward the place of information in our culture. To this extent, it is potentially of great consequence not only how we construct digital libraries but how we talk about them and whom we include in the conversation. "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" Alice asks the Cheshire Cat. "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," the Cat replies. "I don't much care where –" Alice says. "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," the Cat replies. "– so long as I get somewhere," Alice adds. "Oh, you're sure to do that," says the Cat, "if you only walk long enough." Here is where the parallel between Alice in Wonderland and digital libraries ends. For those of us involved in digital library research and development care very much about where we're trying to get to. Whether, or however, we articulate it, most of us are greatly concerned with the societal consequences of the work we do. It is my belief that more explicit attention to this direction – and a broader, more inclusive debate about it – will lead to a stronger and more focused research agenda.

AB  - We present our work to develop digital objects to represent and convey a specific category of scientific knowledge: computable biomedical knowledge (CBK). Properly developed, validated, implemented and stewarded, CBK has the potential to accelerate the translation of actionable knowledge from scientific discovery to clinical application. Our research takes an infrastructural approach to CBK, initially by focusing on the creation of a conceptual model for packaging computable biomedical knowledge - the Knowledge Object (KO) - and on corresponding efforts to create an architecture for KO management and implementation. Additionally, our work is grounded in the FAIR principles, such that KO artefacts should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and we are exploring aligning KOs with emerging best practices for FAIR Digital Objects (FDO). The outcomes of this work resonate in clinical contexts, health professions education, healthcare quality improvement, biomedical and translational research and population care. Our KO model is also of interest to researchers and practitioners interested in knowledge science, including those working with semantic technologies and other forms of digital objects.

AB  - The scarcity of literature in educational institutions is a serious problem in different parts of the world, particularly in developing countries where there is a real need for better access to information. It is vitally important that the technological gap between developing and developed countries is narrowed, and scientific journals have a key role to play in ensuring that this takes place. This paper aims to assess and evaluate Digital Publishing (Open Access Publishing and Open Source Models) as a proposed solution to avoid restrictions on accessing scientific knowledge, particularly in the developing countries. More importantly, the paper outlines opportunities and challenges of open-access publishing for the developing countries. However, oftentimes there are mismatches between what the 'donor' countries can reasonably offer and what the developing countries can implement.

AB  - In the earlier years of the Web, libraries focused on moving services online and building digital collections, but in recent years, libraries have emerged as key players in the world of digital publishing. Librarians possess all of the necessary skills to act as digital publishers; they join the ranks of many others who have discovered the barriers around digital publishing are lower than ever. Library-based digital publishing solutions have matured to a point that the act of digital publishing could—and should—become a new core competency for the library profession. To explore this hypothesis, the researchers offer a working definition of digital publishing and assess the key roles that traditional publishers have historically offered over time. They find that librarians already possess the requisite skills to become digital publishers, and the collaborative culture of the library profession is a strength for this new role. Examples of digital publishing from two libraries at the University of California-Berkeley offer a proof of concept. Services at these libraries include the conceptualization of overall Web site strategies, a content plan that emphasizes distinctive and original material, and special projects that promote digital publishing at the local level, even as they take advantage of campus- or system-level services. Researchers find that offering library-based Web publishing services can reinforce overall information management programs and also advance the status of libraries within their respective host organizations. The comparative ease of digital publishing has opened an opportunity for librarians to follow the user as they use the Web in creative ways.

AB  - During the last years, dramatic changes in the electronic publishing landscape have created new roles and changed the traditional ones. Presently, some libraries have capitalised on their experience and knowledge in information technology and electronic publishing to undertake such activities, while at the same time they spearhead the campaign for Open Access spreading within academic communities. The Library &amp; Information Centre (LIC) of the University of Patras (UoP), Greece, has been playing an active role in promoting Open Access (OA) in Greece. Since 2007, LIC has been experimenting with OA publishing practices and tools within the framework of various R&amp;D projects. Two of the major results of these efforts are the ‘Pasithee’ e-publishing platform and the ‘Dexamene’ digital archive for Greek scholarly journals. Both platforms are based on OJS-Open Journal Systems e-publishing software. The two facilities were appropriately modified to meet the LIC’s publishing and archiving requirements respectively. Currently two journals are being hosted on each platform and all four are from the Humanities. The LIC is negotiating with more publishers and editorial teams to host their journals. In this article we focus on: - technical and managerial key issues of the development and operation phases, - services and procedures, - the business model, - technological, procedural and legal issues and problems that were encountered when working together with publishers, editors and authors, and - future plans for improving and upgrading our e-publishing services into an integrated institutional platform to cover all kinds of publications and data types (monographs, conference proceedings, teaching material, bulletins, magazines etc.). The article concludes with a succinct presentation of the Directory of Greek Digital Resources, a pilot infrastructure developed by the LIC which indexes and presents digital publishing initiatives in Greece and aims to become a formal registry of Greek scholarly resources in digital format.

AB  - This year's theme of International Open Access Week was Open for Collaboration, and centered on the political and legal gains open access communities have made worldwide. Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition has been the major organizer of Open Access week since its beginnings in 2007. The world-wide participation of so many different communities in this event, which was celebrated on every continent except Antarctica, shows that the issue of open access, which a few years ago was mainly a concern of the U.S. academic community, now has international backing and is shaping how scientific research will be disseminated in the future.

AB  - Dimensions is a new database that focussed on a different set of problems to other scholarly search systems. Specifically, by the including not only data about publications and their natural associated citation graph, but by also including awarded grant data, patent data and clinical data and altmetric attention data, Dimensions holds a representation of an n-partite graph associated with the heterogeneous research objects. These objects have been treated as heterogeneous, but need to be brought onto the same footing (and homogenised) in order that they should make sense to a user. The links (or edges) in the expanded network of objects is created through extensive use of text mining and machine learning to extract and to normalise data. This article gives an overview of the techniques used to create the Dimensions dataset.

AB  - This study investigates online material published in reaction to a Science Magazine report showing the absence of peer‐review and editorial processes in a set of fee‐charging open access journals in biology. Quantitative and qualitative textual analyses are combined to map conceptual relations in these reactions, and to explore how understandings of scholarly communication and publishing relate to specific conceptualizations of science and of the hedging of scientific knowledge. A discussion of the connection of trust and scientific knowledge and of the role of peer review for establishing and communicating this connection provides for the theoretical and topical framing. Special attention is paid to the pervasiveness of digital technologies in formal scholarly communication processes. Three dimensions of trust are traced in the material analyzed: (a) trust through personal experience and informal knowledge, (b) trust through organized, internal control, (c) trust through form. The article concludes by discussing how certain understandings of the conditions for trust in science are challenged by perceptions of possibilities for deceit in digital environments.

AB  - Background: Many of the discussions surrounding Open Access (OA) revolve around how it affects publishing practices across different academic disciplines. It was a long-held view that it would be only a matter of time before all disciplines fully and relatively homogeneously implemented OA. Recent large-scale bibliometric studies show, however, that the uptake of OA differs substantially across disciplines. We aimed to answer two questions: First, how do different disciplines adopt and shape OA publishing practices? Second, what discipline-specific barriers to and potentials for OA can be identified? Methods: In a first step, we identified and synthesized relevant bibliometric studies that assessed OA prevalence and publishing patterns across disciplines. In a second step, and adopting a social shaping of technology perspective, we studied evidence on the socio-technical forces that shape OA publishing practices. We examined a variety of data sources, including, but not limited to, publisher policies and guidelines, OA mandates and policies and author surveys. Results: Over the last three decades, scholarly publishing has experienced a shift from closed access to OA as the proportion of scholarly literature that is openly accessible has increased continuously. Estimated OA levels for publication years after 2010 varied between 29.4% and 66%. The shift towards OA is uneven across disciplines in two respects: first, the growth of OA has been uneven across disciplines, which manifests itself in varying OA prevalence levels. Second, disciplines use different OA publishing channels to make research outputs OA. Conclusions: We conclude that historically rooted publishing practices differ in terms of their compatibility with OA, which is the reason why OA can be assumed to be a natural continuation of publishing cultures in some disciplines, whereas in other disciplines, the implementation of OA faces major barriers and would require a change of research culture.

AB  - This paper reviews the literature of collection development and management from 2009 and 2010. Themes and trends reflect the profound effect of environmental forces on libraries, including the economic recession, changes in scholarly communication, and an increasingly networked environment. Libraries reduced print collections and moved them to storage or shared repositories and assessed collections to find efficiencies and demonstrate value. Research libraries moved away from collecting everything toward mission-focused collecting, with an emphasis on unique collections. Collaboration across libraries, within institutions, and with nonlibrary partners continued as a key management strategy. Libraries shifted from a just-in-case to a just-in-time approach to collection development, and subject specialists identified new areas of responsibility, such as data curation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION A common concern about openly available electronic theses and dissertations is that their “openness” will prevent graduate student authors from publishing their work commercially in the future. A handful of studies have explored aspects of this topic; this study reviewed dissertation-to-book publication patterns at Carnegie Classification R1 academic institutions. METHODS This study analyzed over 23,000 dissertations from twelve U.S. universities to determine how frequently dissertations were subsequently published as books matching the original dissertation in pagination, chapters, and subject matter. WorldCat and several other resources were used to make publication determinations. RESULTS Across the sample set, a very small percentage of dissertations were published as books that matched the original dissertation on pagination, chapters, and subject matter. The average number of years for dissertations in the study to be published as books was determined for broad subject categories and for select academic disciplines. Results were compared across public and private institutions, and books that were self-published or published by questionable organizations were identified. DISCUSSION Dissertation-to-book trends occur primarily in the social sciences, humanities, and arts. With dissertations for which the author is actively working to publish as a book, the commonly offered 6- to 24-month embargo periods appear sufficient, provided that extensions or renewals continue to be available. CONCLUSION This study has implications for librarians providing services to graduate students, faculty advisors, and graduate colleges/schools in regard to dissertation embargo lengths, self-publishing, and what we have termed questionable publishers, as these areas continue to provide opportunities for librarians to educate these stakeholders.

AB  - Abstract The emergence of predatory journals is a global threat for scientific integrity, particularly in under-resourced settings such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A bilingual course on predatory publishing using a distance education approach was developed for Moroccan researchers as a response to the imperative need for training on research ethics to implement good scientific practices. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted to evaluate outcomes after delivering two education sessions in both French and English. Before this course, 40% of participants indicated that they don’t verify journal quality before manuscript submission and most of them consider Scopus indexing and the impact factor as the best criteria for journal publication. Approximately 50% of surveyees did not have previous information on predatory journals before the webinar. Pressure to publish by supervisors, institutions of affiliation, or funding agencies, was noticed in 43.4% of participants. After the webinar course was delivered, remarkably, the proportion of participants with knowledge on predatory publishing was meaningfully increased from 48.9% to 81%. Importantly, 83.7% of participants indicated that they are motivated to share their new knowledge on predatory publishing with their colleagues. Moreover, the majority of respondents (73.8%) reported that publishing their research in predatory journals may damage their career and professional future. Promisingly, nearly a half or more of participants recommended the use of training based on distance education, surveillance of researchers by their mentors and affiliations, and social networks to increase awareness on predatory publishing. Almost all participants were satisfied with the content of the webinar. Trainers and research institutions in LMICs should benefit from the advent of distance education using webinar platforms to increase awareness on the issue of predatory publishing in their settings.

AB  - ABSTRACT The landscape of scholarly communication is complicated by multiple versions of the same documents, available from different sources. What happens if changes need to be made to published documents when scholars tap so many sources? How can important changes be communicated to readers so that they do not rely on outdated or, worse, repudiated research? This article explores the issues and describes the CrossMark service as a possible solution.

AB  - The ‘distributed national collection’ is a scheme whereby the British Library envisages completing agreements with other libraries to facilitate the development of specialized subject-based research collections in order to make the most of total national resources. The implementation in Australia of a similar scheme, the Distributed National Collection (DNC), was proposed during the late 1980s and 1990s, with the National Library (NLA) as a main advocate, and a great deal of enthusiasm was generated. The use of Conspectus was envisaged, and a DNC Office was set up at the NLA. It failed for various reasons: Conspectus proved unusable, the NLA had to cut back its own acquisitions, and financial restraints forced other libraries to look after their own interests. In the UK, the initiative for collaborative collection development has been driven by the British Library and the Higher Education Funding Councils. The UK has some features which give it a better chance of success - for instance, the responsible office should be independent of all the main players, whereas in Australia this responsibility could be carried only by the National Library; the UK has a more established network of research libraries, including a number outside the higher education/national library nexus; and the existence of BLDSC is highly beneficial. However, key challenges lie ahead, notably the complexities of managing the scheme, the time needed to put it into operation, the commitment demanded from participants (notably some sacrifice of local interests required for ‘deep resource sharing’), and obtaining the initial acceptance needed from users.

AB  - Do we forget those whose voices we rarely hear? Publishers have been using technology to disseminate research since we started publishing, but we often focus on the mainstream needs and forget the perspectives and needs of those voices we rarely hear. This perpetuates disadvantage and reduces diversity throughout the publishing community. Such problems can be considered from two perspectives: the make-up of the publishing industry and the manner by which we disseminate publications. Within the publishing workforce, diversity imbalances have long been acknowledged, for example in the demographic data reported in 2016 (Greco, 2016). And there are too few initiatives to address these limitations, although some attempts are being made, for example the 2017 American Association of Publishers intern programme in partnership with the United Negro College Fund. Similar awareness regarding what and how we publish is less commonly recognized as a problem for inclusivity and broader access to knowledge. An estimated 285 million people throughout the world are thought to have serious visual impairment and another 360 million have deafness or hearing loss (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014). While these are among the most common sensory deficiencies, countless other limitations challenge disabled readers and prevent their access to informational resources. Fortunately, their needs have been recognized in some countries through legislation enforcing accessibility policy within higher education institutions and commercial website owners alike. The implications for publishers are huge. In a recent lawsuit, it was found that the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) websites run by the University of California, Berkeley were in breach of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In this case, the content was inaccessible to blind and deaf people, missing key features such as closed captions and screen-reader compatibility (Straumsheim, 2017). As result the University is currently in the process of taking down all MOOC content, including over 20,000 audio and video files because it is too expensive to make it compliant. With the huge growth of online publishing and digital resources, what must be done to ensure that publishers meet the requirements of legislation (and differences between countries), and is there more we can do? Is the publishing industry stepping up to its responsibilities? From voice recognition software to web-enabled devices, technological advances in content processing are extending the publisher's ability to ensure the broadest possible accessibility of their products, with interoperable formats to suit readers’ diverse needs and capabilities. Platform providers are including accessible download options and the latest updates to web publishing standards, like JATS and EPUB, comply with World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) requirements for access for the visually and motor impaired. So, why isn't every publication able to meet these basic standards? What risks are in play for publishers, libraries, and societies? Why are we still talking about accessibility? Our January 2018 special issue of Learned Publishing will be dedicated to answering these questions from a range of perspectives. Technologists will share the latest breakthroughs in digital workflows and hosting. Librarians will explain the current state of disabled student services on campuses around the world. And we expect to hear directly from readers and learn from their experiences with our products. Publishers can no longer burrow in the sand and hope that accessibility fixes itself. It only takes a bad day of hay fever or a broken arm for each one of us to realize that we are only temporarily abled. Gifts like sight, sound, and mobility are easily taken for granted, but any deterioration in these capabilities can drastically limit our ability to learn and engage with the world around us. As purveyors of the world's growing body of knowledge, publishers have a profound obligation to continually adapt our offerings to meet the needs of all readers, able bodied and otherwise. The January 2018 issue will highlight how national funding agencies and regional legislation require many institutions to provide fully accessible resources to their patrons, with strict legal penalties on academic libraries. Publisher platforms must keep up with accessibility standards and new initiatives are aimed at helping publishers establish a roadmap to conformance. Some content providers are beginning to realize the competitive benefits of inclusive, standards-compliant products. Ultimately, the goal of improved accessibility is rooted in the belief that publishing at its best is inclusive and supportive of the global exchange of knowledge and ideas. Issues of diversity are not limited to the visually impaired, as seen demonstrated in this current issue. Within scholarly publishing, we accept certain norms and terms of engagement. We often require our authors, readers, researchers, and other publishers to conform to these standard practices. It is worth examining these assumptions occasionally, questioning whether they introduce separation and elitism, whether they limit or promote accessibility. Do we enable access for all qualified potential authors, even if language barriers prevent a submission from meeting a journal's standards? Or for readers, who do not understand nuances of language and may misinterpret or misunderstand what is published? See, for example, the article by Sarwat Nauman in this issue, which discusses a research crisis in Pakistan caused by differing educational and cultural values (Nauman, 2017). And, whilst it may appear that there is consensus among researchers, the most recent findings from the Harbingers project reveals subtle differences between early career researchers around the world, particularly with publishing and authorship practices (Nicholas et al., 2017). David Brown (2017) questions if we need new approaches for development of STEM information, which will allow for discovery, access, and reuse of scientific knowledge in a diverse world. Finally, Schmaling and Blume (2017) report on gender differences in peer reviewing, demonstrating that we must regularly examine our biases and work toward a more inclusive global publishing community. It is a big world out there, with an amazing array of people and cultures. Valuing those diverse voices – and ensuring that we allow them to participate in knowledge creation and consumption – is foundational to a healthy society and, while we live in a technically connected world, our core values of humanity must be maintained. It is our responsibility to keep diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility at the heart of our publishing programmes and our professional discourse. P. Smart L. Conrad

AB  - In 2020 the University of Kansas Libraries began a year-long diversity audit of the circulating monograph collection. The study, which utilized the checklist method evaluated the Libraries' holdings based on a curated list of award winning and nominated titles. In addition to determining if specific titles were part of the collection, the study also sought to learn how these books were acquired. The study found that the library owned 60% of the 6,671 titles checked and of those with a known acquisitions method, 59% came via an approval plan. Titles and publishers not profiled by GOBI were significantly less likely to be in the collection as they were not included in the approval plan or highlighted by a slip notification. The Libraries' reliance on GOBI and efficient and streamlined selection and acquisition processes has resulted in a less diverse collection.

AB  - The web began with a vision of, as stated by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, "that much academic information should be freely available to anyone". For many years, the development of the web and the development of digital libraries and other scholarly communications infrastructure proceeded in tandem. A milestone occurred in July, 1995, when the first issue of D-Lib Magazine was published as an online, HTML-only, open access magazine, serving as the focal point for the then emerging digital library research community. In 2017 it ceased publication, in part due to the maturity of the community it served as well as the increasing availability of and competition from eprints, institutional repositories, conferences, social media, and online journals - the very ecosystem that D-Lib Magazine nurtured and enabled. As long-time members of the digital library community and frequent contributors to D-Lib Magazine, we reflect on the many innovations that D-Lib Magazine pioneered and were made possible by the web, including: open access, HTML-only publication and embracing the hypermedia opportunities afforded by HTML, persistent identifiers and stable URLs, rapid publication, and community engagement. Although it ceased publication after 22 years and 265 issues, it remains unchanged on the live web and still provides a benchmark for academic serials and web-based publishing.

TI  - DocMaps Helps Tell a Story
AU  - Alves, Tony
AB  - No research article exists in a vacuum. There are no scientific texts in modern science that do not reference other works, and generally those references are meant to support the authors’ assertions. References are a well-understood way to evaluate a piece of research, and those references help tell a story about how the authors reached their conclusions. References tell the story of the research itself; they show the history, they reveal facts that support the assertions, and they lead the reader to the underlying data. But what about the story behind the evaluation process that brings that research to the public? There is an important story that needs to be told about this part of the life of the research article. The story behind the editorial process—the subplot, so to speak—can help readers and other researchers understand and evaluate the rigor of the peer review and the quality of the publishing process. It would be really useful for readers, funders, and institutions to know what kind of quality checks were made on the manuscript, how many reviewers assessed which versions, and what changes the editor asked the author to make. All of these rich details that are hidden within the editorial workflow should be part of the story. There is an interesting initiative underway to help tell the story behind the editorial process for any document that claims to be a scholarly work. The initiative, called the DocMap Framework, seeks to define a machine-readable protocol that anyone can use to […]

AB  - The task of definition detection is important for scholarly papers, because papers often make use of technical terminology that may be unfamiliar to readers. Despite prior work on definition detection, current approaches are far from being accurate enough to use in realworld applications. In this paper, we first perform in-depth error analysis of the current best performing definition detection system and discover major causes of errors. Based on this analysis, we develop a new definition detection system, HEDDEx, that utilizes syntactic features, transformer encoders, and heuristic filters, and evaluate it on a standard sentence-level benchmark. Because current benchmarks evaluate randomly sampled sentences, we propose an alternative evaluation that assesses every sentence within a document. This allows for evaluating recall in addition to precision. HEDDEx outperforms the leading system on both the sentence-level and the document-level tasks, by 12.7 F1 points and 14.4 F1 points, respectively. We note that performance on the high-recall document-level task is much lower than in the standard evaluation approach, due to the necessity of incorporation of document structure as features. We discuss remaining challenges in document-level definition detection, ideas for improvements, and potential issues for the development of reading aid applications.

AB  - In the ever-evolving landscape of scholarly communication, research impact assessment has expanded beyond traditional citation metrics. Altmetrics, which encompass a wide range of online indicators like social media mentions, downloads, and blog posts, provide insights into the broader societal engagement with scholarly works. This study explores the relationship between Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) and traditional citation metrics within the Library and Information Sciences (LIS) domain, focusing on high CiteScore open-access journals. The study collected bibliographic data of top 100 articles from Dimensions.ai database that were published between 2013 and 2022 and assesses the alignment between scholarly recognition and online engagement. The top 100 articles were selected based on highest AAS to focus on the most influential and widely-discussed research in order to provide a comprehensive overview of current trends and impactful findings in the field. The dissemination pattern of research highlights across various social web platforms is examined, shedding light on the diverse channels through which research reaches audiences. Correlation analysis reveals a weak and statistically insignificant connection between AAS and citations for the studied journals, emphasising the nuanced nature of scholarly impact in today’s digital landscape. The findings underscore the need to consider both traditional and alternative metrics when evaluating research influence and engagement in the evolving scholarly communication paradigm of the digital age. While this study is confined to specific journals within the LIS domain, its insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of research impact assessment.&#x0D;

AB  - Abstract Introduction We approach the problem of "predatory" journals and publishers from the perspective of small scientific communities and small journals that may sometimes be perceived as "predatory". Among other characteristics of "predatory" journals two most relevant are their business model and the quality of the editorial work. Materials and methods We analysed 444 Croatian open access (OA) journals in the Hrčak (portal of Croatian scientific journals) digital journal repository for the presence of article processing charges as a business model and the transparency of editorial policies. Results The majority of journals do not charge authors or require submission or article processing charges, which clearly distinguishes them from "predatory" journals. Almost all Hrčak OA journals have publicly available information on editorial boards, including full names and affiliations, and detailed contact information for the editorial office at the Hrčak website. The journal names are unique and cannot be easily confused with another journal or intend to mislead about the journal's origin. While most journals provide information on peer review process, many do not provide guidelines for reviewers or other editorial and publication ethics standards. Conclusion In order to clearly differentiate themselves from predatory journals, it is not enough for journals from small research communities to operate on non-commercial bases, but also to have transparent editorial policies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Institutional repositories (IRs) provide colleges and universities a way to ensure stability of access to and dissemination of digital scholarly communications. Yet, many institutions report that faculty willingness to contribute to IRs is often limited. This study investigates faculty attitudes about IR contributions by tenure status and category of material. METHODS Two focus group interviews were conducted in the spring of 2009 among English department faculty at a large Midwestern university. One group consisted of tenured faculty and the other of tenure-track and adjunct faculty. RESULTS Both groups recognize the benefit of open access to research materials but expressed concern about their intellectual property rights. Untenured faculty spoke more about nonprint research. Both groups also shared concerns about contributing instructional materials, primarily in regard to plagiarism and outdated materials. In regard to faculty service, the tenured group discussed many items they would contribute, while the untenured faculty mentioned very little. DISCUSSION Some minor differences emerged related to experience and tenure status in regard to contributing research and instructional artifacts, but the major variation was the strong support tenured participants gave for contributing service items, compared to the untenured faculty, who did not view this category positively. Tenured faculty viewed the IR as a way to document their own service activities, investigate those of colleagues, and had fewer concerns about plagiarism or other negative effects in the service category. CONCLUSION Promoting faculty contribution of service-related items to an IR may be a way to encourage larger numbers to participate.

AB  - As part of moves towards open knowledge practices, making peer review open is cited as a way to enable fuller scrutiny and transparency of assessments around research. There are now many flavours of open peer review in use across scholarly publishing, including where reviews are fully attributable and the reviewer is named. This study examines whether there is any evidence of bias in two areas of common critique of open, non-anonymous (named) peer review – and used in the post-publication, peer review system operated by the open-access scholarly publishing platform F1000Research. First, is there evidence of potential bias where a reviewer based in a specific country assesses the work of an author also based in the same country? Second, are reviewers influenced by being able to see the comments and know the origins of a previous reviewer? Based on over 4 years of open peer review data, we found some weak evidence that being based in the same country as an author may influence a reviewer’s decision, while there was insufficient evidence to conclude that being able to read an existing published review prior to submitting a review encourages conformity. Thus, while immediate publishing of peer review reports appears to be unproblematic, caution may be needed when selecting same-country reviewers in open systems if other studies confirm these results.

AB  - The objective of the session, "Don't Forget The Little Publishers" was to illustrate to the library community and to publishers alike the opportunities to discover and subscribe to high-quality content from small to medium-sized information providers, which to date are overlooked because these information providers lack the resources to effectively market their content.Attendees came away from the session with a much broader understanding of the challenges small publishers must overcome to sell their content; what types of content they are missing; examples of a number of vehicles that are being used to get content out in the market; novel subscription/pricing alternatives; and success stories from those who manage subscriptions.Conversely, attendees also were presented with trends and challenges the library community is facing that may limit future successes, in particular collection sales.The panel concluded by not concluding a clear direction but left it open for the future, as methodologies and internal/external factors of the participants change.

AB  - In academia, there is a growing acceptance of sharing the final electronic version of graduate work, such as a thesis or dissertation, in an online university repository. Though previous studies have shown that journal editors are willing to consider manuscripts derived from electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), faculty advisors and graduate students continue to raise concerns that online discoverability of ETDs negatively impact future opportunities to publish those findings. The current study investigated science journal policies on open access ETDs and found that more than half of the science journals responding (51.4%) reported that manuscripts derived from openly accessible ETDs are welcome for submission and an additional 29.1 percent would accept revised ETDs under certain conditions.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the educational value of prestigious and productive Spanish scholarly publishers based on mentions of their books in online scholarly syllabi. Design/methodology/approach Syllabus mentions of 15,117 books from 27 publishers were searched for, manually checked and compared with Microsoft Academic (MA) citations. Findings Most books published by Ariel, Síntesis, Tecnos and Cátedra have been mentioned in at least one online syllabus, indicating that their books have consistently high educational value. In contrast, few books published by the most productive publishers were mentioned in online syllabi. Prestigious publishers have both the highest educational impact based on syllabus mentions and the highest research impact based on MA citations. Research limitations/implications The results might be different for other publishers. The online syllabus mentions found may be a small fraction of the syllabus mentions of the sampled books. Practical implications Authors of Spanish-language social sciences and humanities books should consider general prestige when selecting a publisher if they want educational uptake for their work. Originality/value This is the first study assessing book publishers based on syllabus mentions.

AB  - Title and abstractThink of an “appetizing” title that should be as brief as possible but also representative of your contents. A good title, consisting of carefully selected, albeit ‘hot’, words is your ticket to citations. I have come across many papers of mediocre content but with hundreds of citations, just because the author was smart enough to choose the right words in the title. Unfortunately, life is not always serious and more often than not—and for longevity- it shouldn’t be taken too seriously either.Footnote 5 To the extent possible, your Abstract (200–250 words) should be written in non-technical language, aimed at the general reader, and it should not include references or footnotes. This is the most important part of your paper, and the one that everybody will read; it needs to convince the reader that the paper is worth reading. In non-technical language, explain to the reader why you wrote this paper; who has asked for it; what do you add to existing knowledge; what is your methodology; what are your main conclusions. Remember: your abstract is something very different from your introduction, which will probably follow. Thus, do not duplicate.

AB  - Abstract The aging of the professoriate throughout the end of the twentieth century and the early years of the 2000′s (both before and after the end of mandatory retirement in the United States, ca. 1994) has become a source of concern for some scholars and research administrators, who posit that the “greying” of the academy results in lower research activity and a decline in scientific advancement. Some published opinions concur that senior scholars’ research programs do not keep pace with those of their younger colleagues, but little quantitative evidence has been presented to evaluate that claim. In this study, we quantify senior faculty publication activity in six broad fields, comparing their publication rates to their younger colleagues across four modes of knowledge dissemination: journal articles, conference proceedings, books, and book chapters. Career publication activity does not follow the “peak and decline” pattern described in earlier studies. In most fields, journal article publication rates do not decline substantively with age (and in some cases article publication rates are higher among senior scholars), conference proceeding publication rates tend to decline with age, while book and chapter publication rates increase markedly with age. Overall, senior scholars maintain publishing activity levels and tend to shift their focus to the development and evolution of ideas through the publication of longer-format works as books and book chapters.

AB  - Much of the argument around reforming, remaking, or preserving the traditions of scholarly publishing is built on economic principles, explicit or implicit. Can we afford open access (OA)? How do we pay for high‐quality services? Why does it cost so much? In this article, we argue that the sterility of much of this debate is a result of failure to tackle the question of what a journal is in economic terms. We offer a way through by demonstrating that a journal is a club and discuss the implications for the scholarly publishing industry. We use examples, ranging from OA to prestige journals, to explain why congestion is a problem for club‐based publications, and to discuss the importance of creative destruction for the maintenance of knowledge‐generating communities in publishing.

AB  - Around 170 early career researchers (ECRs) from 8 countries were interviewed about the whole range of their scholarly communication attitudes/behaviours during pandemic times and this paper analyses what they said about predatory journals in a wide range of scholarly communication contexts. Because of the delicacy of the topic there was just one question exclusively directed at predatory journals, which asked about policies rather than actions, which yielded nevertheless wide-ranging comments on the topic. ECRs also volunteered information on predatory journals in another half dozen questions, most notably including one on questionable research practices. The source of data was mainly the final interview of three undertaken, with some comparisons made to rounds one and two. Findings disclose the existence of a whole raft of formal and informal assessment policies/coded that direct ECRs to legitimate journals and away from predatory ones. Despite being junior, ECRs are very accultured to the criteria of what is considered as prestige and quality and believe predatory publishing is not even conceivable. They are far more concerned about low-quality research, preprints and borderline ‘grey’ journals. The pandemic has increased the level of questionable practices and low-quality research, but predatory journals were only singled out by a relatively small number of ECRs.

AB  - Peer review is the formal means by which the scientific community assesses the originality, reproducibility, validity, and quality of a research study (Bakker and Traniello 2019). As such, peer review assures nonexperts that they can trust a study's findings (Jamieson et al. 2019). Despite the critical importance of peer review, graduate students, postdocs, and other early career researchers (ECRs) have limited resources for learning about this process (but see Nicholas and Gordon 2011 and Nature Communications 2021). A recent survey found that most reviewers have not received formal training on peer review and that reviewers of all career stages (77%), especially ECRs (89%), desire further training (Warne 2016). This reflects a need for guidance regarding when and how to engage in peer review, best practices for conducting a peer review, and how editors weigh peer reviews in their editorial decisions. In an effort to help new reviewers navigate this process, we (the Raelyn Cole Editorial Fellows) hosted an Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) webinar on peer review in September of 2021 (recording available: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utntl1VGy5g). The webinar had 329 registrants, including 198 students or postdocs, underscoring the desire for peer review resources. The webinar content was largely based on a survey of the associate editors (AEs) of ASLO's three peer-reviewed journals (n = 25 respondents), consisting of five open-ended questions about peer review. Here, we use insights from our survey and webinar to describe how ECRs can join the reviewer pool, provide guidance for writing a useful and time-efficient review, and discuss challenges and opportunities in the evolving landscape of peer review. Peer review begins when an AE sends invitations to potential reviewers. We asked the ASLO AEs how they select reviewers and most said they usually use one reviewer suggested by the authors. Other strategies include using the reviewer list within the ScholarOne submission website, conducting an internet search, selecting based on the AE's knowledge of experts in the field, and selecting a reviewer from the manuscript reference list. Many AEs also try to solicit diverse reviewers in terms of career stage, nationality, gender, etc. Many AEs noted the growing challenge of finding willing reviewers. Jeffrey Krause, AE for Limnology and Oceanography Letters, noted, "I typically don't have issues with finding people to request reviews from. However, getting them to accept is another challenge—my record is somewhere around 11 declines for a review for a single manuscript." This comment reflects a trend in scholarly publishing: the proportion of reviewer invitations leading to a submitted review is declining (Fox et al. 2017; Publons 2018; Bakker and Traniello 2019). Consequently, editors must send a growing number of reviewer invitations per manuscript, ultimately increasing the time to an editorial decision. This trend is often attributed to "reviewer fatigue" (reviewers now being asked to review more manuscripts) and may reflect faster growth in article submissions than growth of the reviewer pool. One way to address reviewer fatigue/shortage is to recruit more reviewers from the underutilized ECR pool. Some AEs already intentionally solicit reviews from ECRs. "PhD students might have insights on cutting-edge topics that are lost on senior scientists," wrote David Baker, AE for Limnology and Oceanography. Reviewing benefits ECRs: it broadens their knowledge, provides insights for improving their own manuscripts, is recognized as a form of service, and opens doors to other editorial opportunities (Schiermeier 2016; Poulson-Ellestad et al. 2020). However, some ECRs are unsure about their qualifications to review. One of the most common questions asked by webinar registrants was: "How do I know if I have the experience needed to review?" After the webinar, we sent a second survey to ASLO AEs, asking a single question: "What qualifies one to be a peer reviewer?" The most common answers indicated that reviewer selections are based on subject area expertise and publication record (Fig. 1a). Notably, holding a Ph.D. was only mentioned by three respondents, suggesting that editors welcome reviews from ECRs who have the necessary expertise and publication experience. So, how can ECRs get involved in peer review? One option is joint-peer-review, in which an ECR reviews a manuscript together with their mentor or advisor (Schiermeier 2016). All ASLO journals support this practice; invited reviewers simply notify the Editor in Chief (EIC) of their plan to conduct a joint-peer-review. This notification is critical given that confidentiality is always a top priority of peer review. Alternatively, senior scientists may provide names of ECRs as alternate reviewers when they cannot review a manuscript themselves. Finally, we encourage ECRs to contact editors of the journals for which they wish to review (via email or at a conference or other networking opportunity) and express their interest in reviewing. Any ECRs interested in reviewing for the ASLO journals may add their name to the association's ECR reviewer database (https://forms.gle/KvbmyTzrVgHKpw9x9). This database, updated periodically, is available to AEs on the dashboard from which they invite reviewers. Reviews are written both for editors and for authors: they help the former make sound editorial decisions and guide the latter on how to improve their manuscript. We asked AEs what makes a review useful, and their answers reflected these two purposes (Fig. 1b). The most common answer was that a useful review argues why a paper should be published or not, describing its strengths and weaknesses. The why argument is critical for editors and is important for both positive and negative reviews. For instance, many editors noted that they often side with the better-argued position when two reviewers disagree on their recommendation (e.g., one suggests a revision and the other suggests a rejection). This is consistent with recent work showing that AEs value the key issues identified by reviewers more than the reviewer's overall recommendation (Falkenberg and Soranno 2018). The second most common answer from AEs was that a useful review explains how the authors can improve their manuscript (Fig. 1b). "The review process should more often be about, 'how can this manuscript be improved' rather than 'how can this manuscript be taken down'," said David Antoine, AE for Limnology and Oceanography. AEs also said that useful reviews explain how the manuscript moves the field forward, describe any major issues or fatal flaws, include specific (not vague) comments, and use a polite tone. To the latter point, it may be useful to write your review, set it aside for a few days, and re-read it before submitting to ensure that your comments are appropriate and professional. Finally, it helps AEs when reviewers describe their own background and expertise. "It is a collegial approach to recognize the limits of knowledge as a reviewer," said George Waldbusser, AE for Limnology and Oceanography: Methods. Reviewers are not expected to be experts on all aspects of the manuscript and describing the limits of your expertise can help the AE weigh the review and/or reconcile conflicting reviews. Another important aspect of peer review is time efficiency. We asked webinar participants how long they typically spend reviewing a manuscript. The most common answer was 4–8 h, but some participants answered that they spend >12 h on a review. When asked how long to spend on a review, Paul Kemp (EIC of Limnology and Oceanography: Methods) said that reviewers should invest the time and effort needed to produce the type of review they themselves would like to receive—a truly helpful review. "Everyone has their own process for reviewing," Paul said, and one should spend whatever time it takes to produce a useful review. "But," he added, "with practice, you get faster!" Nevertheless, there are strategies to save time when reviewing manuscripts (Table 1). We suggest that reviewers use a two- or three-read strategy, in which a quick initial read is used to identify major problems (Nicholas and Gordon 2011). If the reviewer finds a fatal flaw or a major shortcoming after their first read, they can explain the problem, including strong justification for its severity, and need not provide a full review (Table 1). It is also appropriate to contact the AE at this stage if you realize you are not well-suited to review or if the manuscript is unintelligible. The latter includes problems with language and grammar that make it difficult to understand and evaluate the scientific content. If the manuscript is intelligible and publishable in principle, you should read it a second (and optionally, third) time for detail and draft your review. In this case, you can save time by making general comments about recurring problems (Table 1). "A few examples of consistent problems is enough to make your point. It's not your job to rewrite the paper," said Kelly Benoit-Bird, AE for Limnology and Oceanography. When commenting on grammar and linguistic precision, be aware of the disadvantages faced by non-native English-speaking authors (Clavero 2010; Ramírez-Castañeda 2020) and that being a native English speaker is not synonymous with being a good writer (Romero-Olivares 2019). The cost of professional English editing services can be a significant financial barrier for researchers from the Global South (Ramírez-Castañeda 2020). While many universities offer scientific writing assistance or graduate-student-led writing groups, assistance with English language editing often falls on favors from peers (Ramírez-Castañeda 2020). Kind and constructive feedback from a peer reviewer, such as pointing out sentences where the meaning is unclear, can be helpful; however, a reviewer's primary role is to assess scientific merit and not to fix grammatical errors. Ultimately, some researchers are calling for institutional changes to properly address linguistic injustice, such as modifying publication charges to redistribute the costs of professional English editing services so that all the financial burden does not fall on non-native English speakers (Clavero 2010; Ramírez-Castañeda 2020). Engaging more ECRs in peer review can address several current challenges in scientific publishing. ECRs can (1) expand the existing reviewer pool, (2) bring diverse perspectives to review, and (3) support positive peer review ethics. The high turnout for our webinar suggests that ECRs are interested in and motivated to participate in peer review, but many are unsure about whether they are qualified to contribute. Feedback from AEs suggests that ECRs can begin reviewing shortly after they begin to publish. We stress the importance of connecting AEs with this emerging pool of reviewers and the key role that senior scientists can play in training and advocating for ECR reviewers through joint-peer-review and suggesting ECRs as alternate reviewers. ASLO is an international society, and our peer review webinar was attended by participants from 29 countries, including 11 countries from the Global South. This global interest shows promise in diversifying the peer reviewer pool. Peer review activities are currently imbalanced across countries; for instance, researchers from the United States perform more peer reviews per article published than researchers from China (Warne 2016; Publons 2018). Furthermore, willingness to review appears higher among scholars from emerging research-output regions (such as China, Taiwan, Poland, and Brazil) than in those from established regions (such as the United States; Publons 2018). This high willingness to review persists despite language barriers for non-native English speakers, which can present challenges for authors and reviewers alike. While non-native English-speaking ECRs may be intimidated or feel unqualified to serve as peer reviewers (Ramírez-Castañeda 2020), it may be especially beneficial to their professional development to start reviewing early and often. In fact, a survey of ASLO editors showed that non-native English speakers tended to assume the role of AE after obtaining more peer review experience than their native English-speaking colleagues (Poulson-Ellestad et al. 2020). Attracting and training more reviewers from different countries can also grow the reviewer pool and bring new, diverse perspectives to reviews. Finally, we hope that efforts by ECRs to learn about the peer review process will instill positive peer review ethics. This means treating authors the way you would like to be treated (e.g., the 'golden rule'; McPeek et al. 2009) by responding as soon as possible after receiving a review request (so as to not delay the process), reviewing 2–3 manuscripts for every paper you submit as a first author, and maintaining a professional and respectful tone in your written review. Peer review is the backbone of scientific publication; thus, constructively engaging the next generation of peer reviewers is integral to the progression of science. We thank the AEs of the ASLO journals for their thoughtful responses to our survey. We also thank Jim Cloern, Anya Metcalfe, Rita Franco-Santos, Alejandra Sanchos-Rios, and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback on this editorial. Finally, we thank the ASLO EICs and our partners at Wiley, Fiona Sarne and Mia Ricci, for their help in orchestrating the webinar upon which some of this editorial is based.

AB  - A knowledge economy has been defined as one in which the generation and exploitation of knowledge has come to play the predominant part in the creation of wealth. It is not simply about pushing back the frontiers of knowledge; it is also about the more effective use and exploitation of all types of knowledge in all manner of economic activities. One key question is whether there are new opportunities and new models for scholarly publishing that might better serve researchers and more effectively communicate and disseminate research findings. Building on previous work, this paper looks at the costs and potential benefits of alternative models for scientific and scholarly publishing, describing the approach and methods used and summarising the findings of a study undertaken for JISC in the United Kingdom. It concludes that different publishing models can make a material difference to the costs faced by and benefits realised from research communication, and it seems likely that more open access would have substantial net benefits.

AB  - Traditionally, there have been two important media of academic publishing: scholarly journals and scholarly books. The first scholarly journal, the Journal des Sçavans, was founded by Denis de Sallo, appeared already in January 1665 in Paris, reappeared after the French Revolution as the Journal des Savants, and still exists as a leading journal in the humanities. Only a few weeks later, Henry Oldenbourg, the first secretary of the Royal Society of London, established a second scholarly journal, the Philosophical Transactions, with a focus on science. The purpose of these journals was to formalize the extensive correspondence between philosophers and scientists.1 In the 18th and the 19th century, more specialized journals gained in importance, most of which were published by learned societies. At the end of the 19th century, university presses too began to publish scholarly journals. Another traditional means of academic publishing are the various types of scholarly books, in particular monographs, edited volumes, reference works (specialist dictionaries, encyclopedias, and specialty reference manuals), and technical handbooks.2 A narrow definition of academic works would exclude textbooks and books for the broader public. Shavell (2010, 337–39) employs four criteria to determine whether a journal or book is academic in nature: (1) the authors and/or the publisher are usually academics; (2) the readers are mainly academics; (3) the content is academic in character; (4) only low royalties are paid, if any. As of today, scholarly journals are the preferred mode of academic publishing in particular in the sciences and some social sciences (e.g., economics), whereas scholarly books still play an important role in the arts, the humanities, and part of the social sciences. Whereas scholarly books are published by a large number of small national publishers in a multitude of languages, the most important scholarly journals are typically in English language and published by a few large commercial publishers. Until the mid-20th century, the most important journals were published by learned societies, before commercial publishers began to enter the academic publishing market in the 1960s and 1970s by launching new titles or acquiring existing ones. This development has led to a significant concentration of (commercial) publishers in the academic journal market.3 It is difficult to say for sure how many scholarly journals are available around the world. Some sources speak of more than 100,000, others of 87,000 or 73,000.4 In August 2018, Ulrich's Web Directory listed 33,119 active scholarly peer-reviewed English-language journals with about 3 million articles a year, complemented by an additional 9,372 journals in other languages. As an important subset, 11,655 journals with 2.2 million articles were included in the Clarivate Analytics' Journal Citation Reports (STM, 2018, 25–26). The Web of Science (WoS) database counted almost 12,500 journals in 2019 (see below, Section 2.2.1). With the mass expansion of academic education and the increasing size of faculty after World War II, publications in peer-reviewed, highly ranked journals have become an important precondition for academic careers in many disciplines, in particular in the sciences, economics, and partly in the other social sciences. In 1964, Eugene Garfield launched the Science Citation Index to calculate the impact factors of journals in science, medicine, and technology. This index was later followed by the Social Sciences Citation Index in 1973, the Arts & Humanities Citation Index in 1978 (Regazzi, 2015, 86–88), and the Emerging Sources Citation Index in 2015. These indices led to the development of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF), a metric that serves to rank a scholarly journal based on the number of citations to articles in that journal by articles in other indexed journals within a certain time period. During the same time, commercial publishers have increased their market shares to the detriment of non-for-profit publishers, such as learned societies and universities, becoming the dominant players in the market for scholarly journals. Today, the "big five" commercial academic publishers—Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, and Sage—cover more than half of the market for scholarly journals. Since the 1980s, we have seen a sharp increase not just in the number of journals but in particular also in journal subscription prices, forcing many academic libraries to cancel serials subscriptions and to cut back on new monographs (the so-called serials crisis, cf. Eger & Scheufen, 2018, 23–29). These developments induced an increasing number of scholars, initially in the United States, to promote open access (OA) to scholarly articles as a replacement of or an addendum to the subscription model. After some individual initiatives in the late 1980s, the early 2000s saw the emergence of a global movement by scholars, librarians, and research sponsors, resulting in the "Budapest Open Access Initiative" (February 2002), the "Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing" (June 2003) and the "Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities" (October 2003).7 Two roads to OA can be distinguished8: First, gold OA refers to electronic journals with OA for all readers, often based on creative commons licenses. The publishers' costs are covered not by subscription fees but from other sources, such as article-processing charges (APCs)9 paid by authors, libraries, learned societies, or research sponsors, or subsidies from learned societies and other sources. Hybrid OA journals, whose numbers are rising fast, allow the authors to choose between paying an APC, thereby granting the reader OA, or not paying an APC and requiring the reader to pay for access to the article.10 A special branch of gold OA is mega-journals, the first one of which, PLOS One, was first published in 2006. In these journals, the peer review is restricted to examining only the soundness of the submitted articles but not their broader interest or impact. Also, mega-journals are not oriented towards a specific subject matter. The second road, green OA, refers to authors self-archiving pre-prints or post-prints of their papers on so-called OA repositories, potentially in addition to publication in traditional subscription-based journals. OpenDOAR listed 5,713 repositories in July 2021, of which 5,073 were classified as institutional repositories managed by universities, faculties, or other academic institutions, 364 as disciplinary (subject) repositories which aggregate research papers in specific disciplines (e.g., PubMed Central, arXiv, SSRN, and RepEc), 138 as aggregating repositories (including Academia and Scielo), and 139 as governmental repositories.11 Whereas institutional and disciplinary repositories generally respect the authors' or publishers' copyright, so-called Robin Hood or Pirate OA repositories do not. The most prominent example is Sci-Hub, founded in 2011 by Alexandra Elbakyan, a young scholar from Kazakhstan, which made over 60 million journal articles publicly available. Due to complaints by academic publishers, Sci-Hub had to switch domains several times.12 Recent years have seen the emergence of academic social networks such as Research Gate and Mendeley, as well as a stream of new forms of disseminating scientific content, including blogs, podcasts, and Facebook posts by prominent scholars. Regarding OA books, the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) in June 2021 listed 43,036 academic peer-reviewed books from 621 publishers.13 The number of academic journals, as listed in the WoS database, has been growing steadily over the past two decades, from around 5,000 in 2000 to almost 12,500 in 2019 (Figure 1).14 Source: Author's calculations based on data from Web of Science (2021) The academic journal market is dominated by a few large commercial publishers, with the "big five" accounting for more than half of the academic journals listed by the WoS in 2019: Elsevier (1,754 journals), Springer (1,406), Wiley Blackwell (1,242), Taylor & Francis (1,199), and Sage (642).15 However, due to a downturn by Elsevier that began around 2006, this dominance has declined from around 60% in 2000 to around 51.7% in 2019 (Figure 2). Source: Author's calculations based on data from Web of Science (2021) Coupled with the advent of the internet and the concurrent increasing digitization of academic works, which through the bundling of different journals and/or formats ("big deals") facilitated second-degree price discrimination, this dominance has led to a drastic increase in subscription prices since the early 1990s (Bergstrom, 2013; Eger & Scheufen, 2018; Ramello, 2010). The resulting serials crisis—with academic libraries having to cut their journal portfolio—gave rise to a new publishing regime that offers OA to journal content. The share of pure (i.e., non-hybrid) OA journals as listed by the Directory of Open Access Journals (2021) has been increasing steadily, from around 3% of all WoS-listed journals in 2000 to more than 10% in 2019 (Figure 3). Source: Author's calculations based on data from Web of Science (2021) and DOAJ (2021) Interestingly, pure OA journals also gained ground in terms of quality. Figure 4 shows boxplots of the impact factors16 of closed access (CA) versus OA journals over time. While CA journals enjoyed an impact factor advantage over OA journals for a long time—all location scales of the impact factor for CA journals being above the ones for OA journals—OA journals are nowadays of the same quality, notwithstanding considerable differences between disciplines (see the contribution by Eger et al. to this issue). In 2019, impact factor distributions of both OA and CA journals are at the same level. Thus, advancing both in quantity and in quality, OA journals are becoming ever more relevant. The literature has identified the following advantages of an OA regime for academic works: (1) OA publications are likely read and therefore (2) cited more widely,17 which in turn (3) raises the incentives for academic authors to publish their research results as citations increase their reputation. These observations led to a broad discussion in academia as to whether the copyright regime may impede the evolution towards a universal OA regime, with very different conclusions being drawn regarding the impact of OA from a social welfare perspective (Scheufen, 2015; Shavell, 2010). Source: Author's calculations based on data from Web of Science (2021) and DOAJ (2021) The growing relevance of academic OA publishing warrants a closer look at the development of pure OA journals as the gold road towards OA. Figure 5 shows the number of newly launched OA journals from 2002 to 2020. Following relatively slow growth from 2002 to 2014, with fewer than 500 new OA journals per year (except 2013), the number has exceeded 1,000 in every year since, peaking in 2017, when more than 2,000 new OA journals were added to the DOAJ database. Today, the DOAJ database counts more than 16,000 OA journals in many different fields of research, published in 80 languages by publishers from 126 countries.18 Source: Author's calculations based on data from DOAJ (2021) Notwithstanding this impressive development, the relevance of OA journals varies substantially across academic disciplines (Figure 6).19 The research field with the largest attributed number of OA journals is Social Sciences (3,817), followed by Health Sciences (2,785), Technology and Engineering (1,416), and Language and Literature (1,153). By contrast, the natural science fields of Mathematics & Statistics (341), Physics & Astronomy (274), and Chemistry (181) feature only few OA journals.20 Source: Author's calculations based on data from DOAJ (2021) Remarkable differences also exist regarding a variety of OA journal characteristics (Table 1).21 Most (52%) OA journals leave the copyright of published works with the author, whereas the traditional CA regime demands that the exploitation rights are transferred to the publisher. Moreover, only around 28% of all OA journals charge APCs—a remarkable finding, as the OA regime implies the transition from a "reader pays" to an "author pays" model. Other fees (e.g., a submission fee to cover the review process) are charged by only around 2% of all OA journals. Nevertheless, author fees may constitute a significant obstacle for authors to publish in an OA venue, especially for non-tenured researchers seeking to publish in highly ranked journals, which are most likely to charge APCs (Budzinski et al., 2020). This obstacle also applies in particular to many researchers from developing countries, whose institutions rarely cover such costs. Yet 18% of OA journals provide for the possibility to waive such author fees. OA publishing may indeed be considered a form of development aid, for two reasons: First, few institutions in the developing world have so far been able to subscribe to academic journals. The OA regime can thus promote scientific participation and thereby foster the global evolution of science as a "trial and error" process. Free or cheaper access to literature for researchers in the developing world tends to increase both their output (number of publications) and input (number of references) (Mueller-Langer et al., 2020). Second, an OA regime grants access to the latest results in science for groups who were previously excluded because they are not "club" members of a university library. This includes, e.g., corporate researchers, physicians, or farmers. Notwithstanding all the changes discussed above, scholarly journals remain the most important medium of communication in many disciplines. For more than 300 years, they have been fulfilling the four key functions of registration (attribution), certification of articles (peer review), dissemination (distribution, access), and preservation (scholarly memory and permanent archiving). In recent decades, a fifth function must be added: the evaluation of researchers and their institutions.22 The increasing importance of OA articles in scholarly journals has triggered some controversial discussions, in particular regarding the questions as to whether OA negatively affects the quality of journal articles, whether OA improves the dissemination of research results, and how OA affects the competition between academic publishers as well as the distribution between academics and non-academics, between poor and rich universities, and between poor and rich countries. We shall discuss each of these questions and some related points in more detail below. In times when "alternative facts" tend to trump sound research results, academia must provide the public with reliable information. The users of this information should be sufficiently certain that the results are based on proper methods, reflect the state of science in the specific field, and were obtained independently, e.g., of any political or commercial interests.23 For that reason, strict and continuous quality control of research results is a "conditio sine qua non" for academic publishing. Facilitating the communication of content from authors to readers, the academic journal market may be characterized as a two-sided market (Rochet & Tirole, 2003). While readers look for the most important research results in their fields by top authors, the latter are interested in the journal's reputation, in wide readership, and in citations. Thus, journals with high impact factors hold the greatest attraction to both sides. With this in mind, the crucial question arises what effect, if any, OA is likely to have on the quality of academic articles. Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado in Denver, is very skeptical regarding the quality of OA articles, especially those that are financed by APCs: "By adding a financial component to the front end of the scholarly publishing process, the open-access movement will ultimately corrupt scholarly publishing and hurt the communication and sharing of novel knowledge" (Beall, 2013, 590). A weak form of "corruption" would refer to OA publishers' incentives to neglect rigorous peer review and to accept more submitted papers in order to increase revenues from APCs.24 However, the commercial publishers' incentives to increase the number of articles to the detriment of the journal's quality vanishes at the point where the quality degradation actually reduces the APCs that the journal is able to charge, as well as publisher's profits (Shavell, 2010, 334). A stronger form of "corruption" refers to the "new business model" of "predatory publishing," where some OA journal publishers have been known to exploit in particular young and inexperienced scholars who depend on publications for their careers, or to allow experienced authors to publish low-quality articles in OA journals, by accepting articles with little or no peer review, listing academics on editorial boards without their permission, mimicking the name or website style of reputable journals, and so on. In 2010, Beall established a list of predatory publishers, which was regularly updated until it went offline in January 2017 in response to heavy criticism not only from the publishers concerned but also from OA advocates who argued that Beall exaggerated the problem to suit his general ideological objection to OA. From today's perspective, this quality problem seems to be a transitory one which exists only in some disciplines (e.g., economics), whereas in other disciplines, such as biology, some OA journals are among the highest ranked journals and there is no evidence whatsoever of a systematic quality gap.25 If senior researchers warn their younger colleagues and if academic institutions and research sponsors refuse to finance the APCs for articles accepted by predatory journals, this business model is bound to vanish. A further concern voiced by Beall is that OA may discriminate against new and unpopular ideas: "Popular ideas will receive funding; new and unpopular ideas, regardless of their merit, will remain unfunded" (Beall, 2013, 590). However, this problem is a general consequence of the peer-review process, regardless of whether the paper was submitted to a traditional or an OA journal. Gans and Shephard (1994) list many prominent examples which suggest that mainstream articles are generally more likely to pass the review process than original and creative but heterodox ones. In their contribution to this special issue, Watt & Mueller-Langer show in a two-sided model that OA can be a feature of high-quality journals. The last decades have seen an increasing availability both of data on virtually any subject and of software that serves to process that data almost instantaneously. Consequently, there has been a surge of empirical articles in practically every discipline. For such articles, besides the well-established pre-publication peer review, another option for quality assurance becomes available: post-publication replication studies.26 A distinction can be made between pure replication, where the same data and the same methods are used as in the original study, and scientific replication, which uses either (1) different data but the same method, (2) the same data but new methods, or (3) new data and new methods. A researcher's incentive to conduct a replication study depends on (1) the probability of detecting an error or fraud in previously published findings, (2) the impact of the article under scrutiny, (3) the cost of replication, and (4) the willingness of editors to publish replication studies. Whereas some 50 years ago, when data were saved on punch cards, the cost of replication consisted mainly of technical barriers, today copyright protection and data disclosure policies are the main determinants of replication cost.27 Regarding point (4), the first journals specializing in replication studies have already been established, including Experimental Results, an OA journal by Cambridge University Press with a focus on Science, Technology and Medicine, and the International Journal for Re-Views in Empirical Economics by Springer Nature. Over the last 15 years or so, a number of replication studies in several disciplines have revealed that the results of many original studies, even when published in highly ranked journals, could not be replicated, prompting many academics to speak of a "replication crisis."28 The challenge is to improve the quality of empirical research by easier access to data so as to be able to correct wrongful results of empirical studies ex post and deter fraud or simply carelessness ex ante, without destroying the incentives to conduct the original study in the first place. Another important question is whether digitization and the internet have facilitated the quality assessment of academics, of their scholarly and societal impact, and of their institutions. Currently, the quality assessment of academic researchers and of entire universities is largely based on JIFs, which were "originally designed to provide a metric for journals competing with each other" (European Commission, 2019, 52), being a measure of the average citations to all articles in a journal volume but not of the citations to the individual articles. In practice, a few articles are cited frequently, and many articles are not cited at all.29 Moreover, an article may also attract many citations for being inadequate, and citations are easily manipulated (Anderson, 2018, 183–191). For example, some journals encourage the authors of submitted papers to cite related papers that were previously published in the same journal (self-citations). Others have extended this practice by coordinating the effort of several journals (citation cartels).30 Overall, this focus on JIFs induces scholars and their universities to adapt their performance and the allocation of resources to these output-oriented measures and leads to distortions with detrimental consequences for the quality of research (Osterloh & Frey, 2014). Quite in line with Goodhart's Law—"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" (STM, 2018, 67)—scholars are induced to "hit the target but miss the point." The Leiden Manifesto on research metrics, which originated from the Leiden International Conference on Science and Technology Indicators in September 2014, is likewise critical of the existing metrics to assess research output and instead formulates 10 principles to guide research evaluation in the future (Hicks et al., 2015).These discussions raise the question whether the new technologies (digitization and the internet) and business models (OA) of academic publishing enable superior methods to assess scholars and their institutions. Some authors see the future in OA publishing with a broader base of readers and open post-publication evaluation. For example, Randy Schekman of UC Berkeley, the 2013 Nobel laureate in biology, criticizes the focus on a small number of highly ranked luxury journals, arguing instead for a system where all articles that meet a journal's editorial criteria should be published and made freely available, financed by APCs or other revenues. This is essentially the strategy of mega-journals such as PLOS One (Schekman, 2013). From a similar perspective, James Heckman, who shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Economics, and Siddarth Moktan (Heckman & Moktan, 2020) examined the relationship between placement of publications in the top five journals in economics and receipt of tenure in economics departments. They detect a "tyranny of the top five journals", which favors careerism over creativity. From the readers' perspective, the crucial question is how to find relevant high-quality articles at low search costs, especially in a situation where OA vastly expands the set of freely available articles to choose from. Discipline-specific journal rankings of course reduce search costs to some extent. However, the inadequacy of the JIF as a measure of article quality has been duly noted. Thus, an important challenge to academic publishing is to provide reliable signals on the quality of journal articles that are independent of the journal that published the article. Digitization, the internet and alternative metrics for research evaluation also affect how research results are disseminated. Regarding scholarly impact, i.e., reception by other researchers, there is an ongoing discussion as to whether OA articles receive more or fewer citations than those with a paywall. Evidence to that effect is presented in the contributions by McCabe & Snyder and by Eger et al. to this special issue. Regarding societal impact, i.e., reception by the broader public, the classical, mainly citation-based bibliometrics is increasingly being complemented with altmetrics, which relies on tweets, likes, mentions, or downloads in the social media, online reference managers such as Zotero and Mendeley, scholarly blogs, and online repositories.33 In the gradual transition from traditional subscription journals to OA, the crucial question is how to manage the tightrope walk between two evils: On the one hand, high subscription fees may simply be replaced with high APCs.34 Powerful journal publishers merely have to adapt their business model to continue exploiting the universities or research sponsors. On the other hand, low APCs may not suffice for publishers to cover their cost and to earn a reasonable profit, giving them no incentive to publish high-cost journals. The challenge is to establish sufficient competition to induce journal publishers to process articles of certified quality at minimal cost and disseminate them fast and cheaply to the interested public. The level of competition depends not least on the economic and legal environment of OA publishing. If there were only pure OA journals, publishers would compete for good submissions. If all authors had to cover the APCs from their personal funds, the APCs would tend towards a level that enables the publishers to earn normal profits. However, in the real world, publishers of pure OA journals, hybrid OA journals and CA journals co-exist with OA repositories, and APCs may be subsidized by universities or research sponsors. Under these conditions, different regulatory strategies to foster OA will have specific effects on the level of APCs. Here are some examples: (1) If green OA is promoted via mandates or an inalienable right to secondary publication, as has been the case in Germany since January 2014, publishers of subscription journals find it difficult to increase their fees. This could also deter the publishers of OA journals from increasing their APCs. In any event, a discipline-specific embargo period must be set: If it is too short, it will undermine the publishers' incentive to publish the journal in the first place; if it is too long, the effect on subscription fees will be minimal. A mandate for gold OA by research funders could even strengthen the bargaining position of the publishers of OA journals and thereby increase APCs.35 (2) If excellent scholars support the establishment of new OA journals, this could foster competition among publishers of OA journals for good authors. Yet this strategy faces the problem that it takes many years to establish a good reputation and to attract excellent authors. Until then, the new journal will have little effect on the APCs/subscription fees of the incumbent journals. (3) Consortia of academic libraries can constitute a countervailing power to the big journal publishers, potentially restricting the level of APCs. One example is the DEAL project in Germany, which so far comprises two "transformational agreements" between a consortium of most academic libraries in Germany on the one hand and Wiley and Springer as big publishers of scholarly journals in all disciplines on the other hand. There is a controversial discussion whether such agreements impede competition on the journal market to the detriment of small publishers or indeed strengthen competition. In any event, such agreements seem to promote the transformation of traditional CA journals into hybrid OA journals.36 OA publishing may entail several distributional effects: First and foremost, the shift from "reader pays" to "author pays" can create obstacles for poorly funded researchers, for example, in developing countries. As we have seen, 18% of OA journals offer APC waivers for such researchers. Second, unilateral or country-specific steps to foster OA, such as the DEAL project mentioned above, may lead to the overrepresentation of researchers who enjoy support to the detriment of those who do not. Moreover, publishers may be reluctant to accept papers from researchers from countries that put author fees under specific pressure, e.g., by awarding authors an inalienable right of secondary publication. Third, mandatory gold and/or green OA may create distributional effects due to path dependencies that originate from discipline-specific incentives mechanisms, such as the reward structure in science or cultural features. Accordingly, especially for non-tenured researchers, mandatory gold OA may harm their careers in fields where OA cannot yet compete with well-established and esteemed CA journals.37 An example for distortion effects due to cultural features may be the Ingelfinger rule, e.g., in the field of Biology. In this regard, a (forced) green OA publication may conflict with a publication of a work in a journal since the Ingelfinger rule prevents that a journal publishes works that have been published elsewhere. In general, the transition to OA journals implies that authors or their sponsors pay for the ability of readers from all over the world to freely access the articles. This outcome may be undesirable whenever predominantly poor authors write for predominantly rich readers. Then, the global budget that is available to finance academic articles is allocated inefficiently, in which case the transition to OA may reduce the number of articles published. The problem is exacerbated when many of the readers are employed outside of academia.38 Generally, however, we can assume that universities whose faculty publish many articles also account for a large share of the readership, in which case any redistribution between authors and readers (or their sponsors) as a consequence of the transition to OA should be limited. A number of technological, economic and legal developments since the second half of the 20th century have dramatically changed the academic publishing market and triggered discussions about the very future of academic publishing. Academic journals, which in most disciplines continue to be the most important medium of academic communication, are increasingly owned by commercial publishers, with the top five publishers currently selling more than 50% of all journals. Digitization and the advent of the internet have allowed these publishers to engage in "big deals" with academic libraries, selling bundles of licenses which entitle the libraries to access a wide range of journals at a fixed price per year. As a result, journal subscription prices and academic libraries' expenditure on academic journals have been dramatically increasing to the detriment of smaller publishers and expenditure on books ("serials crisis"). To cope with these problems, a number of national and international initiatives triggered the development towards OA, a new business model of academic publishing. Today, a rapidly growing number of pure and hybrid OA journals are no longer financed by subscription fees but instead by publication fees paid by the authors or their sponsors (gold road). Moreover, institutional and disciplinary OA repositories have been established (green road), and the traditional channels of academic communication have been supplemented with social media, blogs, etc. Another consequence of digitization and the internet has been the strongly facilitated collection and processing of data, boosting empirical research in many disciplines. The downside of this development is an increasing number of cases where the results of quantitative studies cannot be replicated ("replication crisis"). Solving this problem would require coping with copyright and data-protection issues and motivating academic authors to engage in replication studies. The discussion continues as to how these developments affect the quality control of academic journal articles, the evaluation of scholars and their institutions, and the size and allocation of financial means for academic publishing. This special issue adds to the discussion a set of articles dealing with some of its central aspects, including the evaluation of scholars by scientometric indices (Ramello & Migheli), welfare effects of mandatory open access (Watt & Müller-Langer), the citation impact of OA (McCabe & Snyder; Eger, Mertens, & Scheufen), access to research data (Handke, Guibault, & Vallbé), "Plan S" to support OA in Europe (Armstrong), and the DEAL Project to support OA in Germany (Haucap, Moshgbar, & Schmal). We would like to thank Sönke Häseler for valuable comments. The authors also acknowledge open access funding by project DEAL. n/a.

AB  - The BioOne database of scholarly journals in the biological and ecological sciences was established in the belief that broad and enduring access to scholarly literature is essential not just to the health of the scientific enterprise but also to the health of the wider society in which science is practiced. The prevailing model of profit-based journal publishing – in which high prices are impeding access – is harming the interests of the very scientists who provide its life-blood. The BioOne business model seeks to meet the interlocking goals of providing broad and enduring access, supporting the publishing enterprise of scholarly societies, and assuring that BioOne will keep pace with changes in technology and scientific communication.

AB  - The extent of publishing in predatory journals in economics is examined. A simple model of researcher behavior is presented to explore those factors motivating an academic to publish in predatory journals as defined by Beall (Criteria for determining predatory open access publishers, Unpublished document, 3rd edn, 2015. https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ ). Beall's lists are used to identify predatory journals included in the Research Papers in Economics archives. The affiliations of authors publishing in these outlets indicate that the geographic dispersion of authorship is widespread. A very small subset of authors is registered on RePEc. A surprising number of authors who are in the RePEc top 5% also published in predatory journals in 2015.

AB  - Summary Lack of diversity on editorial boards might generate disparities in editorial and peer review that contribute to gender and geographic disparities in scholarly publishing. We use a comprehensive data set of the peer review process for all papers submitted to the journal Functional Ecology from January 2004 to June 2014 to examine how gender, seniority and geographic location of editors and reviewers influence reviewer recruitment and scores given to papers by reviewers. The gender ratio of editors for Functional Ecology was majority male, but the proportion of female editors increased over time. The gender ratio of selected reviewers was also highly majority male, but the proportion of women selected as reviewers increased over the 10 years largely because the number of women on the editorial board increased and female editors invited more female reviewers than did male editors. Male editors selected &lt;25% female reviewers even in the year they selected the most women, but female editors consistently selected ˜30–35% female reviewers. Editors also over‐selected reviewers from their own geographic locality. Women invited to review were less likely to respond to review invitations, but more likely to accept if they responded. Women invited to review responded to the invitation similarly regardless of whether the editor inviting them was male or female, but men invited to review were both less likely to respond and more likely to decline if the editor was female. Review scores given to papers did not differ between male and female reviewers, and final decisions (proportion of papers rejected) did not differ between male and female editors. The proportion of women among selected reviewers decreased with editor seniority when the editor was male but increased with editor seniority when the editor was female. Thus, the gender ratio of selected reviewers differed little between early‐career male and female editors but differed a lot between late‐career (more senior) male and female editors. Individuals invited to review were less likely to agree to review if the editor was more senior. Editor gender, seniority and geographic location affect who is invited to review for Functional Ecology , and how invitees respond to review invitations, but not the final outcome of the peer review process. To increase diversity of reviewer populations, journals should increase gender, age and geographic diversity of their editorial boards.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the role of science and technology studies (STS) journal editors in organizing and maintaining the peer review economy. We specifically conceptualize peer review as a gift economy running on perpetually renewed experiences of mutual indebtedness among members of an intellectual community. While the peer review system is conventionally presented as self-regulating, we draw attention to its vulnerabilities and to the essential curating function of editors. Aside from inherent complexities, there are various shifts in the broader political-economic and sociotechnical organization of scholarly publishing that have recently made it more difficult for editors to organize robust cycles of gift exchange. This includes the increasing importance of journal metrics and associated changes in authorship practices; the growth and differentiation of the STS journal landscape; and changes in publishing funding models and the structure of the publishing market through which interactions among authors, editors, and reviewers are reconfigured. To maintain a functioning peer review economy in the face of numerous pressures, editors must balance contradictory imperatives: the need to triage intellectual production and rely on established cycles of gift exchange for efficiency, and the need to expand cycles of gift exchange to ensure the sustainability and diversity of the peer review economy.

TI  - Effective Practices and Strategies for Open Access Outreach: A Qualitative Study
IS  - 1
VL  - 6
AU  - Dawson, Diane
C1  - University of Saskatchewan
AB  - INTRODUCTION There are many compelling reasons to make research open access (OA), but raising the awareness of faculty and administrators about OA is a struggle. Now that more and more funders are introducing OA policies, it is increasingly important that researchers understand OA and how to comply with these policies. U.K. researchers and their institutions have operated within a complex OA policy environment for many years, and academic libraries have been at the forefront of providing services and outreach to support them. This article discusses the results of a qualitative study that investigated effective practices and strategies of OA outreach in the United Kingdom. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 individuals at seven universities in the United Kingdom in late 2015. Transcripts of these interviews were analyzed for dominant themes using an inductive method of coding. RESULTS Themes were collected under the major headings of “The Message”; “Key Contacts and Relationships”; “Qualities of the OA Practitioner”; and “Advocacy versus Compliance.” DISCUSSION Results indicate that messages about OA need to be clear, concise, and jargon free. They need to be delivered repeatedly and creatively adapted to specific audiences. Identifying and building relationships with influencers and informers is key to the uptake of the message, and OA practitioners must have deep expertise to be credible as the messengers. CONCLUSION This timely research has immediate relevance to North American libraries as they contend with pressures to ramp up their own OA outreach and support services to assist researchers in complying with new federal funding policies.

AB  - Researchers from Uzbekistan are leading the global list of publications in predatory journals. The current paper reviews the principles of implementation of the “publish or perish policy” in Uzbekistan with an overarching aim of detecting the factors that are pushing more and more scholars to publish the results of their studies in predatory journals. Scientific publications have historically been a cornerstone in the development of science. For the past five decades, the quantity of publications has become a common indicator for determining academic capacity. Governments and institutions are increasingly employing this indicator as an important criterion for promotion and recruitment; simultaneously, researchers are being awarded Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees for the number of articles they publish in scholarly journals. Many talented academics have had a pay rise or promotion declined due to a short or nonexistent bibliography, which leads to significant pressure on academics to publish. The “publish or perish” principle has become a trend in academia and the key performance indicator for habilitation in Uzbekistan. The present study makes a case for re-examining the criteria set by the Supreme Attestation Commission of the Republic of Uzbekistan for candidates applying for Ph.D. and D.Sc. as well as faculty promotion requirements in the light of current evidence for the deteriorating academic performance of scholars.

The article provides a historical overview for collaborative activity of this kind, and gives an organisational perspective on the current developments. It describes the process by which potential issues for international collaboration were selected, discusses the opportunities for collaboration in each ‐‐ library purchasing consortia, subject‐based information gateways, mirroring of databases, authentication systems, and the scholarly communications crisis ‐‐ and reports on progress with those issues. The strengths and weaknesses of this formal, nation‐to‐nation approach are also discussed.

AU  - Holdom, Shoshannah
C1  - Humbul Humanities Hub, Research Technologies Service, Oxford University, UK
AB  - In recent years, Latin America has been one of the world's fastest growing areas for Internet connectivity. While numerous studies have examined the factors contributing to this communications explosion, this article concentrates upon one of its effects—the proliferation of freely available, scholarly, peer-reviewed electronic journals in the fields of literary, cultural and area studies. This article argues that in the field of Latin American studies, the majority of e-journals are being produced in Latin American countries, rather than in the US or the UK for example. It is Latin American academics, rather than their US and UK counterparts, who are embracing new technologies and the opportunities facilitated for effective dissemination of research. In order to understand this marked move towards electronic scholarly journals, this article outlines the state of Internet connectivity in the region, the financial and material constraints and other restrictions placed upon academic publication, and the lack of international visibility of Latin American scholarly print journals. While questions need to be addressed as to the future sustainability and preservation of these free journals, many of them managed by individual academics and funded by their universities, this article argues that electronic publishing offers Latin American academics an unprecedented opportunity to disseminate their research. Furthermore, this model gives international academics immediate, free access to important research that is emerging from the continent, which is the subject of study. Such access has the potential to revolutionize the way that international academics approach Latin American studies and to encourage a greater degree of international academic debate.

AB  - Outlines the nature of research and publishing in Arabic, the attempts to encourage resource sharing in the Arab Gulf States, the existing arrangements for interlibrary lending and the development of electronic document delivery systems that facilitate interlibrary lending. A case study examined the availability of relevant technology and personnel with appropriate expertise in three major libraries in Kuwait: Kuwait University, the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training, and the National Scientific and Technical Information Center. Questionnaires and interviews, intended to assess staff attitudes and perceptions, were used to examine the reasons why the Ariel system of Electronic Document Delivery appeared to have not yet been adopted, although it has been increasingly used in other parts of the world for more than 10 years. The paper notes that the adoption of this new technology in Kuwait is supported in principle, but is hindered by lack of awareness, skills and motivation, and speculates about the wider implications for the Gulf States.

AB  - Publishing has transited from traditional to Electronic format making information resources available to users without much subscription. E-publishing is engendered by the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT), this development has brought about increase in the number of scholarly communication in circulation. The awareness and rate of e-publishing differs among faculties, it based on this that this study was carried out to survey the situation of e-publishing and open access of librarians in three federal universities in Southern Nigeria, five research questions were formulated to guide the study. The methodology adopted is descriptive survey, questionnaire was given to a total population of 64 librarians consisting of librarians from the institutions understudy, the data collected from the study shows that though librarians are aware of e-publishing but they have not being publishing as should have been expected in University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) out of the 95% that aware of electronic publishing only 30% have published there articles electronically, in University of Lagos (UNILAG) 100% indicated that they have published electronically while in University of Benin (UNIBEN) 45.4% percent indicated yes while 54.5% said they have not published their articles electronically. On availability of open access it was discovered that they have access as a total of 84% from UNN responded Yes, UNILAG 100% said Yes while in UNIBEN 90.9%. The following problems based on their scoring militating against e-publishing and open access in Nigeria. Inadequate power supply; inadequate computer terminals; inadequate funding for subscription payment.

AB  - This paper aims to study the electronic publishing (e-publishing) trends in India, to compare the results with another study conducted in Singapore, and to identify the challenges, opportunities and problem areas faced by the publishing industry in Asia. Findings of the survey show that about one-third (35%) of the Indian and about three-quarters (74%) of the Singaporean publishers are engaged in e-publishing, with a further 20% of Indian publishers likely to start e-publishing in the next three years. A slightly higher percentage of Singaporean respondents over Indian feel that e-publishing has a bright future, but with marketing problems in the region being cited as a barrier to entering into the business. The main reasons for not introducing e-publishing in the Indian publishing houses have been lack of awareness about the new technology on the part of publishers and poor acceptability of epublications among users.

TI  - Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries: Issues and Solutions
IS  - 2
VL  - 96
AU  - Harger, Nancy
AB  - Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries: Issues and Solutions is a collection of ten articles about issues of electronic access and use of books and journals in medical libraries. Management of electronic resources has become an essential function for medical libraries. “These papers offer some solutions to the issues surrounding electronic resources, and indicate areas for further research” (p. 3).Subjects of the papers include costs and challenges of shifting collections from print to electronic materials; collaborative arrangements and cost sharing that may save on the cost of bundled electronic journals; models for pricing electronic journals, development of electronic journals, and history of pricing; development of open access scholarly publishing and ways open access affects the pricing of subscription journals; and the issue of open access publishing and desired relief for library budgets.Another topic emerges from the development of the new and primarily digital Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (WCMC-Q). The WCMC-Q is the first US medical school located outside the United States. “In Qatar, the Distributed eLibrary is accessed via more than 100 computers placed in offices, classrooms, labs, and clusters throughout the medical branch building and accessible through wired and wireless networks” (p. 28).Cooperative activities—initiatives to improve access to health information in Latin America and the Caribbean regions—offer “a perspective on how such limitations were overcome through the establishment in 1967 of a cooperative network between the Pan American Health Organization and Latin America and Caribbean countries” (p. 42). One instance involves two libraries that collaborate to share an electronic journal management system, TDNet, and reviews the implementation of the system. Another example covers the provision of mediated document delivery to off-campus students from the library's online collections or from interlibrary loan. It is of interest that the program does not require students to find the articles themselves.Other topics include the development of a web-based online catalog that integrated the e-collection and the print collection and the peculiar reluctance of courts to permit suits in negligence and strict liability against publishers for erroneous information that leads to harm (p. 101) and reviews of implications for medical libraries.In searching WorldCat for similar books about electronic information resources, this reviewer identified eight titles, but none were specific to medical libraries aside from this book and the Medical Library Association's DocKit #3: Collection Development and Management for Electronic, Audiovisual, and Print Resources in Health Sciences Libraries [1]. As one of only two books cited in WorldCat, this compilation fills a need and makes helpful suggestions for further research. Technology is advancing so rapidly and e-resources are so vital to health care that this book would be helpful to medical libraries in managing resources.

AB  - An increasing number of colleges and universities throughout the world are adopting electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) as either an option or a requirement for graduate degrees. This movement has resulted in questions about the role of these electronic documents in the world of scholarly communications and publishing. One specific question raised by students and their faculty advisors has been whether or not ETDs would be viewed as prior publications and would, as such, be ineligible for consideration for publication in traditional journals. This article presents survey findings that indicate that, while more study is needed, this concern appears to be largely unwarranted.

AB  - The acquisition of bepress by Elsevier in August 2017, while unpopular among many librarians, provides both companies opportunities for expansion and growth. This The Balance Point column outlines some of the benefits to both companies and the reaction by the library community. Also addressed is the announcement by the Penn Libraries that they are searching for new open platforms to potentially replace bepress's Digital Commons. The column concludes with some discussion of Elsevier's relationship with open access content and the impact of the acquisition on the scholarly communications infrastructure.

AB  - ABSTRACT The long‐established peer‐review practices in scholarly journals have remained largely unchanged by the introduction of the Internet. Nevertheless, critique of the shortcomings of current practices (bias, slowness, etc.) have led to many publishers and journals experimenting with novel ways of performing and organizing peer review, enabled by e‐publishing and new revenue models. This article proposes a taxonomy of such innovations and discusses a number of cases where, for instance, the assignment of reviewers is handled differently from current best practice. New models, which seem particularly attractive to manuscript authors, are acceptance of any scientifically valid articles as practiced in ‘megajournals‘. and increased transparency about how the peer‐review process in a particular journal works.

AB  - Ensuring the reproducibility of research is a multi-stakeholder effort that comes with challenges and opportunities for individual researchers and research communities, librarians, publishers, funders and service providers. These emerge at various steps of the research process, and, in particular, at the publication stage. Previous work by Knowledge Exchange highlighted that, while there is growing awareness among researchers, reproducible publication practices have been slow to change. Importantly, research reproducibility has not yet reached institutional agendas: this work seeks to highlight the rationale for libraries to initiate and/or step up their engagement with this topic, which we argue is well aligned with their core values and strategic priorities. We draw on secondary analysis of data gathered by Knowledge Exchange, focusing on the literature identified as well as interviews held with librarians. We extend this through further investigation of the literature and by integrating the findings of discussions held at the 2022 LIBER conference, to provide an updated picture of how libraries engage with research reproducibility. Libraries have a significant role in promoting responsible research practices, including transparency and reproducibility, by leveraging their connections to academic communities and collaborating with stakeholders like research funders and publishers. Our recommendations for libraries include: i) partnering with researchers to promote a research culture that values transparency and reproducibility, ii) enhancing existing research infrastructure and support; and iii) investing in raising awareness and developing skills and capacities related to these principles.

AB  - Wiki4R will create an innovative virtual research environment (VRE) for Open Science at scale, engaging both professional researchers and citizen data scientists in new and potentially transformative forms of collaboration.It is based on the realizations that (1) the structured parts of the Web itself can be regarded as a VRE, (2) such environments depend on communities, (3) closed environments are limited in their capacity to nurture thriving communities.Wiki4R will therefore integrate Wikidata, the multilingual semantic backbone behind Wikipedia, into existing research processes to enable transdisciplinary research and reduce fragmentation of research in and outside Europe.By establishing a central shared information node, research data can be linked and annotated into knowledge.Despite occasional uses of Wikipedia or Wikidata in research, significant barriers to broader adoption in the sciences or digital humanities exist, including lack of integration into existing research processes and inadequate handling of provenances.The proposed actions include providing best practices and tools for semantic mapping, adoption of citation and author identifiers, interoperability layers for integration with existing

AB  - The current state of scholarly communication is presented as one of contest between an increasingly commercial system that is dysfunctional and incompatible with the basic aims of scholarship, and emerging alternatives, particularly open access publishing and open access archiving. Two approaches to facilitating global participation in scholarly communication are contrasted; equity is seen as a superior goal to the donor model, which requires poverty or inequity to succeed. The current state of scholarly communication within the discipline of communication is examined. A relatively healthy percentage of not-for-profit publishers and at least 76 fully open access journals suggest strong potential for emancipating scholarship in communication from commercial imperatives. Specific sites of struggle and actions for scholars, including developing open access journals and self-archiving, are presented.

AB  - The engagement of young researchers in the process of scholarly publishing is essential to their career development as well as to advancing science. It signals active involvement with the discourse in a field and contribution to the body of knowledge. Writing and reviewing scientific articles can facilitate a deep understanding of the scientific process and the nuances of effective experimental design as well as the acquirement of appropriate scientific communication skills; notably, these skills are central to the competitiveness and success of young professionals (YPs) in today's and tomorrow's workplace, be it in academia or industry. A number of research studies have explored the benefits of engaging young researchers in scientific publishing. As highlighted in some of these studies, despite the importance of the early exposure of graduate students and young researchers to scientific writing and peer review, relevant activities are often not prioritized within the framework of educational programs, thus leading to the limited development of key skills—critical to the success of YPs across different fields—such as communicating research to a general audience, structuring ideas through effective scientific writing, and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of experimental design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">[1]</xref> . Thus, it is of paramount importance that YPs are aware of the benefits of becoming actively involved in the publication process, both as authors and reviewers, and are also provided—and pursue themselves—relevant opportunities toward augmenting their technical and communication skills, which can prove valuable in their current and future careers. The IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society (AP-S) offers a range of journals, covering the entire spectrum of the antennas and propagation field, that represent excellent opportunities for YPs to advance their career through publishing and reviewing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">[2]</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">[7]</xref> .

AB  - The presence of the Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 has inevitably affected the way how scholars proceed to write. Thus, activities intended to yield a piece of scientific writing facilitated by the obtainability and accessibility of internet browsing is called scholarly publishing. Since English has indisputably become the language of international scholarship and research, it is urgent to have the skill in writing scientific articles benefitting the support from IR 4.0 principles. What is going on with academics and what should they do dealing with the IR 4.0 pertinent to their scholarly writing activities, benefits, and drawbacks. This paper discusses what scholarly publishing in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and how it supports the process of writing articles for publishing. The purposes of this paper are to explain (1). What are scholarly publishing and industrial revolution? (2). Why is it essential for academics? (3) How does writing scholarly publication in Industrial Revolution 4.0 work? Writing the scholarly publication in English has become obligatory for Teacher-Educator Authors (TEAs) and undergraduate students to doctoral students in Indonesia. The study was a descriptive qualitative library to build a conceptual paper for the purpose of a further study. The method was by reviewing any related kinds of literature to provide sufficient arguments for the three research questions. The outcome is several claims, arguments, and evidence gambits for any author to consider. Theoretically, the IR 4.0 principles have significantly eased the flexibility of the process, the quality, and the credibility of research outputs.

AB  - Although established forms of peer review are often criticized for being slow, secretive, and even unfair, they are repeatedly mentioned by academics as the most important indicator of quality in scholarly publishing. In many countries, the peer review of books is a less codified practice than that of journal articles or conference papers, and the processes and actors involved are far from uniform. In Sweden, the review process of books has seldom been formalized. However, more formal peer review of books has been identified as a response to the increasing importance placed on streamlined peer-reviewed publishing of journal articles in English, which has been described as a direct challenge to more pluralistic publication patterns found particularly in the humanities. In this study, we focus on a novel approach to book review, Kriterium, where an independent portal maintained by academic institutions oversees the reviewing of academic books. The portal administers peer reviews, providing a mark of quality through a process which involves reviewers, an academic coordinator, and an editorial board. The paper studies how this process functions in practice by exploring materials concerning 24 scholarly books reviewed within Kriterium. Our analysis specifically targets tensions identified in the process of reviewing books with a focus on three main themes, namely the intended audience, the edited volume, and the novel role of the academic coordinator. Moreover, we find that the two main aims of the portal-quality enhancement (making research better) and certification (displaying that research is of high quality)-are recurrent in deliberations made in the peer review process. Consequently, we argue that reviewing procedures and criteria of quality are negotiated within a broader discussion where more traditional forms of publishing are challenged by new standards and evaluation practices.

AB  - Abstract One of the most dramatic changes in global publishing in the last decade has been the emergence of China. China now has more researchers than the United States, outspends the United States and European Union in research and publishes more scientific papers each year than any other nation in the world. The quality of these papers is also increasing, with more appearing in top‐ranked journals and gaining more citations overall. Despite this success, China has gained an unenviable reputation for research misconduct and geopolitical issues threaten its continuation. Given the impact of China's growing presence on editors, publishers and non‐Chinese authors seeking to publish in the same journals, it is important to understand the reasons, directions and outcomes of these changes, their effect on Chinese scholars and local Chinese journals, and where they might be leading. In this review paper I explore the rise of Chinese scholarship, its influence on global publishing and on Chinese scholars, and how the Chinese government is responding to its new role in global academic publishing.

AB  - ABSTRACT Copyright law grants exclusive rights to authors of original works of authorship, but those rights are subject to numerous exceptions and limitations, including fair use in the United States and fair dealing in Canada. These exceptions have traditionally worked to ensure that the rights of copyright owners are adequately balanced with the interests of subsequent authors, researchers, and consumers of copyrighted works. Moreover, fair use has emerged as the most promising legal mechanism for the digitization, preservation, and study of large collections of copyrighted work. Fair use and fair dealing provide much of the flexibility needed to ensure that copyright protection serves to facilitate scholarship rather than threaten it. Scholars encounter copyright law both as authors and as users of copyrighted works. With an eye toward the future, this panel will examine the extent to which the discourses and practices of the past decade have contributed to shaping and reshaping our scholarly environment, how the information field has responded, and why and how information scholars, researchers and professionals ought to remain engaged in these matters in the future.

It is formidable; from Fredrich Miescher’s nuclein extraction in the 1860s to Rosalind Franklin’s double helix X-ray in the 1950s to revolutionary next-generation sequencing in the late 2000s. Now consider the scientific paper, the medium used to describe and publish these advances. How is the scientific paper advancing to meet the needs of those who generate and use scientific information? We review four essential qualities for the scientific paper of the future: ( i) a robust source of trustworthy information that remains peer reviewed and is ( ii) communicated to diverse users in diverse ways, ( iii) open access, and ( iv) has a measurable impact beyond Impact Factor. Since its inception, scientific literature has proliferated. We discuss the continuation and expansion of practices already in place including: freely accessible data and analytical code, living research and reviews, changes to peer review to improve representation of under-represented groups, plain language summaries, preprint servers, evidence-informed decision-making, and altmetrics.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article is a revised version of a talk given at the ALPSP seminar of the same name in February 2005. The current state of play with electronic‐only (‘e‐only’) journals is reviewed, along with some data on the different ways print and electronic editions are used. The drivers for and against a move to e‐only journals are discussed, including economic and commercial issues, long‐term access and preservation, and the growing divergence between the capabilities of print and electronic journals.

AB  - New and alternative scientific publishing business models is a reality driven mostly by the information and communication technologies, by the movements towards the recovery of control of the scientific communication activities by the academic community, and by the open access approaches. The hybrid business model, mixing open and toll-access is a reality and they will probably co-exist with respective trade-offs. This essay discusses the changes driven by the epublishing and the impacts on the scholarly communication system stakeholders' interrelationships (publishers-researchers, publishers-libraries and publishers-users interrelationships), and the changes on the scientific publishing business models, followed by a discussion of possible evolving business models. Whatever the model which evolves and dominates, a huge cultural change in authors' and institutions publishing practices will be necessary in order to make the open access happen and to consolidate the right business models for the traditional publishers. External changes such as policies, rewarding systems and institutions mandates should also happen in order to sustain the whole changing scenario.

AB  - Open-access journals, which provide access to their scholarly articles freely and without limitations, are at a systematic disadvantage relative to traditional closed-access journal publishing and its subscription-based business model. A simple, cost-effective remedy to this inequity could put open-access publishing on a path to become a sustainable, efficient system.

AB  - Knowledge is essential to saving lives and improving wellbeing. The term open science has been applied to improving the transparency of knowledge generation, but open science also has the potential to address many of the problems of inequity, inaccuracy, and misconduct that plague research, as well as to build public trust.1Besançon L Peiffer-Smadja N Segalas C et al.Open science saves lives: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.BMC Med Res Methodol. 2021; 21: 117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar The UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science2UNESCOUNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949Date: 2021Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar depicts a world where all science is available, accessible, and usable in all languages, by all who need it; where all actors are transparent about the people and processes used in generating and communicating knowledge; and where knowledge generation, access, and use in academia is not hampered by inequalities or issues of inappropriate credit. Achieving this ideal is a huge task. Here we focus primarily on open research because if research is not open, the rest of the vision set out in the UNESCO Recommendation cannot be achieved. Scientific knowledge in recent centuries has been defined by, and has emanated from, high-income countries (HICs). The world's oldest scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, was first published in England in 1665, by and for men of European origin,3Lyons HG The officers of the Society (1662–1860).Notes Rec R Soc Lond. 1940; 3: 116-140Crossref Google Scholar a tradition followed by The Lancet when it was launched in 1823. As the number of scientific journals increased after World War 2, the expectations of authorship, descriptions of methods, presentation of data, and extent of reference citation changed. These changes were driven not only by growth in science but also by the profitability of scholarly publishing for large publishing companies and scholarly societies.4Buranyi S Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?. The Guardian, June 27, 2017https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-scienceDate accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar By the last decades of the 20th century many libraries found they could not pay for the ever-increasing numbers of journals published at premium prices. Simultaneously, the citation impact factor (IF) commodified journal prestige as the route to academic funding and success.5Roberts R Bibliometrics: an obituary for the impact factor.Nature. 2017; 546: 600Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar The resulting perverse incentives to publish in journals with a high IF contributed to many of the problems of reproducibility and trust6ScienceInnovation and Technology CommitteeUK ParliamentReproducibility and research integrity.https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmsctech/101/report.htmlDate: May 10, 2023Date accessed: July 2, 2023Google Scholar that now plague academic publishing.7American Society for Cell BiologySan Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. DORA.https://sfdora.org/read/Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar The end of the 20th century and birth of the internet saw the emergence of lower cost, open access publishers and databases in not only HICs but also countries in Africa (African Journals Online, AJOL) and South America (Scientific Electronic Library Online, SciELO). Unfortunately, academic institutions worldwide embraced the IF as a key measure of academic value, rather than supporting open access regional journals for disseminating research and supporting academic scholarship in their own countries.8Abritis A McCook A Cash bonuses for peer-reviewed papers go global.Science. 2017; 357: 541Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar Success in science now typically equates with publishing as many research papers as possible, in the highest IF journals possible, which often have subscription paywalls or high article-processing charges (APCs). Researchers usually peer review the content of these journals gratis. The adoption of these perverse incentives means large investments to publish papers in high IF journals without achieving a complete description of research, or open data, methods, software, or other outputs. Such publish or perish incentives have also encouraged predatory journals, papermills, and plagiarism, falsification, and fabrication.9InterAcademy PartnershipCombatting predatory academic journals and conferences.https://www.interacademies.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/1.%20Full%20report%20-%20English%20FINAL.pdfDate: March, 2020Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar In the past decade, open science has emerged to help address some of these issues. Researchers can now use open platforms and repositories (eg, Open Science Framework and GitHub) to transparently report their work from conception through protocol development, to data collection and analysis, and ultimately to publication.1Besançon L Peiffer-Smadja N Segalas C et al.Open science saves lives: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.BMC Med Res Methodol. 2021; 21: 117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar When protocols are posted before data collection (eg, protocols.io), methodology cannot be revised post hoc to suit the results obtained.10Center for Open ScienceRegistered reports: peer review before results are known to align scientific values and practices.https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reportsDate accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar Open peer reviews increase transparency of the strengths and limitations of research and journals' decision-making processes.11Wolfram D Wang P Hembree A et al.Open peer review: promoting transparency in open science.Scientometrics. 2020; 125: 1033-1051Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar When preprints are available, all willing readers can peer review before final publication.12Sever R Eisen M Inglis J Plan U: universal access to scientific and medical research via funder preprint mandates.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000273Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar Many funders and journals now require data underlying the study to be available, and some institutions incentivise data sharing.13Moher D Bouter L Kleinert S et al.The Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers: fostering research integrity.PLoS Biol. 2020; 18e3000737Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar Researchers in some low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) settings have successfully adopted elements of open science.14Mwangi KW Mainye N Ouso DO et al.Open science in Kenya: where are we?.Front Res Metr Anal. 2021; 6669675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar However, barriers to universal adoption of open science persist. Despite calls for incentives to reward open practices,13Moher D Bouter L Kleinert S et al.The Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers: fostering research integrity.PLoS Biol. 2020; 18e3000737Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar academia and funders have been slow to change so that researchers continue to respond to the old incentives applied to their promotion, tenure, and funding decisions. Some LMICs mimic the worst HIC practices by incentivising publication in high IF journals, even paying researchers to do so.15Buguzi S Tanzania's researchers offered US$22,000 to publish in international journals.Nature. 2023; 618: 446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar No universally available infrastructure monitors adoption of open science, or uses open science to discourage misconduct or questionable research practices. Furthermore, LMICs are rarely given co-leadership in open science discussions, limiting the global applicability of resulting outputs. Given a history of appropriation of their countries' resources and exploitation of their countries' people,16Keikelame MJ Schwartz L Decolonising research methodologies: lessons from a qualitative research project, Cape Town, South Africa.Glob Health Action. 2019; 121561175Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Binagwaho A Allotey P Sangano E Ekström AM Martin K A call to action to reform academic global health partnerships.BMJ. 2021; 375n2658PubMed Google Scholar struggling with practical issues, such as unreliable electricity or internet and language and literacy barriers to publication, and challenges in obtaining funding and visas to attend international conferences and meetings,18Velin L Lartigue JW Johnson SA et al.Conference equity in global health: a systematic review of factors impacting LMIC representation at global health conferences.BMJ Glob Health. 2021; 6e003455Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar many LMIC researchers question why they should do additional work to make their hard-earned work freely available to anyone.19Boyes B Open access to scholarly knowledge in the digital era (chapter 1.1): the alienation of African knowledge—open access as a pharmakon.

We propose four steps to address the issues around incentives, deterrents, supporting infrastructure, and equitable leadership that can support the global adoption of open science. First, as described in the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA),7American Society for Cell BiologySan Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. DORA.https://sfdora.org/read/Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar system-wide change is needed to shift incentives across the research ecosystem. Researchers' promotion and tenure are determined by universities, which are themselves dependent on their institutional ranking to receive funding, with each having their own unique key performance indicators (KPI). Without addressing these KPIs, change in the research ecosystem is unlikely to occur. These incentives depend on where, not what, research is published. Researchers who serve as reviewers receive no promotion and tenure credit for their reviews. Instead, promotion and tenure and institutional ranking should depend on the degree to which the researcher and institution produce research that is open, transparent, reproducible, and useful. Peer reviewers similarly should receive academic credit for open reviews, as well as when their didactic points about problems found commonly in research are reused by other reviewers. Global groups such as the UNESCO Global Open Science Partnership can gather together key stakeholders, including institutions, funders (including governments), researchers, journals, and the public, to create the global standards for open, transparent, reproducible, and useful research. They can start with existing resources, including what is open,2UNESCOUNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949Date: 2021Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar transparency definitions, and tools such as the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship20Wilkinson M Dumontier M Aalbersberg I et al.The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship.Sci Data. 2016; 3160018Crossref PubMed Scopus (6729) Google Scholar and Transparency and Openness Promotion in Journal Practices and Policies (TOP) guidelines.21Open Science FrameworkGuidelines for Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) in journal policies and practices "The TOP Guidelines".

The National Academies Press, Washington, DC2019Google Scholar are also important for transparency. Usefulness is measured by research reuse and value to society, defined by key stakeholders at regional or local levels. Collaborative pilot studies that include funders, researchers, and journals could help test and refine the standards for open, transparent, reproducible, and useful research in the real world. Such pilot studies could help ensure that change is properly incentivised at each layer, and gather evidence as to whether the approach improves transparency and quality. The studies could be used to develop a change management plan to scale up the approach to the wider research ecosystem. Second, with open methods and data, institutions, funders, and governments might more easily uncover research misconduct. Misconduct that has different meanings in different cultures, such as plagiarism,24Ison DC An empirical analysis of differences in plagiarism among world cultures.J Higher Educ Policy Manage. 2018; 40: 291-304Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar should have a global definition. Organisations such as the Committee on Publication Ethics and the World Conferences on Research Integrity can help foster such discussions. Then, bodies related to, but independent from, existing stakeholders could investigate and coordinate a standardised and timely response for different levels of misconduct.6ScienceInnovation and Technology CommitteeUK ParliamentReproducibility and research integrity.https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmsctech/101/report.htmlDate: May 10, 2023Date accessed: July 2, 2023Google Scholar The independent bodies could help address issues such as who administers sanctions for misconduct and who protects whistleblowers.25Rhodes R Strain JJ Whistleblowing in academic medicine.J Med Ethics. 2004; 30: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar The approach to investigation should be transparent, consistent, and timely. Third, a global consensus on open science practices and tagging structures and the infrastructure tools to implement them is essential to support attribution and measurement of open science, transparency, and reuse.26Lawrence R Why interoperability matters for open research—and more than ever. Scholarly Kitchen.https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/Date: April 6, 2023Date accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar The infrastructure tools must be freely available to enable global implementation while sanctioning misconduct. Global tagging and open integrated infrastructure alone could help combat fraud and misappropriation. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools should be explored in all areas of reporting and monitoring open science. Effective tools could help efficiently measure publication, reuse, and attribution of methodology, data, results, and peer review, thus facilitating the new incentive structure. Finally, equity must be at the core of open science, with recommendations and pathways developed with researchers, institutions, funders, and governments to address the long-standing needs and concerns of LMICs.27Mwelwa J Boulton G Wafula JM Cheikh L Developing open science in Africa: barriers, solutions and opportunities.Data Sci J. 2020; 19: 31Crossref Google Scholar Recognising the heterogeneity across different LMICs, there is rarely a one size fits all solution. For example, APCs remain out of reach for many researchers in LMICs: waivers do not apply to many LMICs,28Druelinger D Ma L Missing a golden opportunity? An analysis of publication trends by income level in the Directory of Open Access Journals 1987–2020.Learned Publishing. 2023; 36: 348-358Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar or can be seen as unwanted charity. Thus, active co-leadership is crucial, lest the power imbalance that favours HIC researchers and institutions yields efforts that are not truly equitable. By co-leading efforts with research from LMICs in defining and performing research that is open, LMIC researchers' work can get visibility, credit, and future funding. By applying local and regional definitions of valuable research and rewarding reuse, researchers would be incentivised to undertake research beneficial to their communities. Offering credit for peer reviews and reuse of key didactic review points would incentivise peer reviewers. Language and accessibility barriers must be overcome if science equity is to be achieved;29Al-Janabi A Publish in English or perish. Chemistry World, April 28, 2022https://www.chemistryworld.com/careers/publish-in-english-or-perish/4014820.articleDate accessed: July 2, 2023Google Scholar, 30Brinn S Kasdorf B Making research accessible: the arXiv accessibility forum moved the action upstream. Scholarly Kitchen.https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/06/28/__trashed-4/Date: June 28, 2023Date accessed: July 5, 2023Google Scholar AI could help scale those challenges if implemented equitably (figure). These initiatives will require coordination, cooperation, and investment, and sharing decision-making power to develop solutions that accomplish these goals and are acceptable to all. Investment can be achieved by shifting incentives away from high IF publishing4Buranyi S Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?. The Guardian, June 27, 2017https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-scienceDate accessed: June 7, 2023Google Scholar to global open science and independent bodies. Willingness to incorporate LMIC concerns, priorities, and cultures in global open science is likely to be challenging, but the goal of making science more accessible, equitable, and reliable is well worth the effort. Everyone with a stake in open science—which includes, literally, everyone—must be willing to work together to develop a detailed, actionable, agreed-upon blueprint for global open science with effective incentives and safeguards. This global cooperation and collaboration between countries that may be at odds politically and financially has few precedents. However, the reward for these efforts will be scientific knowledge that is transparent, accessible, generated fairly, and fully accessible and available to improve society and save lives. We urge all those working on disparate parts of this enterprise to coordinate efforts to achieve an open research enterprise for the benefit of all.

IS  - 1
VL  - 58
AU  - Turner, Christine
AB  - Scholarly publishing is the information marketplace in which academic libraries function, and major shifts in traditional publishing and pricing models are in process. Library consortia have long been viewed as a means of increasing purchasing power and reducing costs. In late 2010, the Five College Libraries (FCL) hired R2 Consulting, LLC to investigate and make recommendations regarding how the Libraries cooperate more closely on the acquisition, management, and delivery of electronic resources. This study examines and evaluates how other academic library consortia are licensing and acquiring electronic books, databases, journals and streaming media. The organizations, activities, processes, history and trends of e-resource acquisitions and collection development at the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL), Orbis Cascade Alliance (OCA), Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN) and Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC) are presented with data collected by the author. Additional context is provided through a literature review, and a discussion of current practices provides a sampling of the new directions academic library consortia are taking and the challenges they face.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to explain the nature of the “e‐Science’ revolution in twenty‐first century scientific research and its consequences for the library community. Design/methodology/approach The concepts of e‐Science are illustrated by a discussion of the CombeChem, eBank and SmartTea projects. The issue of open access is then discussed with reference to arXiv, PubMed Central and EPrints. The challenges these trends present to the library community are discussed in the context of the TARDis project and the University of Southampton Research Repository. Findings Increasingly academics will need to collaborate in multidisciplinary teams distributed across several sites in order to address the next generation of scientific problems. In addition, new high‐throughput devices, high‐resolution surveys and sensor networks will result in an increase in scientific data collected by several orders of magnitude. To analyze, federate and mine this data will require collaboration between scientists and computer scientists; to organize, curate and preserve this data will require collaboration between scientists and librarians. A vital part of the developing research infrastructure will be digital repositories containing both publications and data. Originality/value The paper provides a synthesis of e‐Science concepts, the question of open access to the results of scientific research, and a changing attitude towards academic publishing and communication. The paper offers a new perspective on coming demands on the library and is of special interest to librarians with strategic tasks.

AB  - This article introduces, defines, and describes predatory publishers and journals and shows how they hurt science and victimize individual researchers. Academic evaluation that only counts the number of publications may not provide an accurate measure of scholarly achievement, as journals routinely accept papers with little or no peer review.

TI  - European science ministers call for open access to research publications, data
IS  - 23
VL  - 94
AU  - Widener﻿, Andrea
AB  - Science ministers from European Union nations agreed last month to make publicly funded research publications freely available by 2020, a move European Commissioner for Research, Science & Innovation Carlos Moedas called "huge" and "life-changing." The unanimous decision sets a policy goal of "immediate access" to such research, as well as associated data, published by scientists in the EU's 28 member countries. Each country will implement its own publication policy. The open access push was spearheaded by the Netherlands, which is leading the EU for a six-month term that ends June 30. "The results of publicly funded research are currently not accessible to people outside universities," says Sander Dekker, Dutch state secretary for education, culture, and science. "As a result, teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs do not have access to the latest scientific insight that can be relevant to their work. Universities have to take out expensive subscriptions with publishers to gain access

AB  - The Berkeley Research Impact Initiative (BRII) was one of the first campus-based open access (OA) funds to be established in North America and one of the most active, distributing more than $244,000 to support University of California (UC) Berkeley authors. In April 2015, we conducted a qualitative study of 138 individuals who had received BRII funding to survey their opinions about the benefits and funding of open access. Most respondents believe their articles had a greater impact as open access, expect to tap multiple sources to fund open access fees, and support the UC Open Access Policy and its goal of making research public and accessible. Results of the survey and a discussion of their impact on the BRII program follow.

AB  - The proportion of research outputs published in open access journals or made available on other freely-accessible platforms has increased over the past two decades, driven largely by funder mandates, institutional policies, grass-roots advocacy, and changing attitudes in the research community. However, the relative effectiveness of these different interventions has remained largely unexplored. Here we present a robust, transparent and updateable method for analysing how these interventions affect the open access performance of individual institutes. We studied 1,207 institutions from across the world, and found that, in 2017, the top-performing universities published around 80–90% of their research open access. The analysis also showed that publisher-mediated (gold) open access was popular in Latin American and African universities, whereas the growth of open access in Europe and North America has mostly been driven by repositories.

AB  - Criteria for the evaluation of most scholars' work have recently received wider attention due to high-profile cases of scientific misconduct which are perceived to be linked to these criteria. However, in the competition for career advancement and funding opportunities almost all scholars are subjected to the same criteria. Therefore these evaluation criteria act as 'switchmen', determining the tracks along which scholarly work is pushed by the dynamic interplay of interests of both scholars and their institutions. Currently one of the most important criteria is the impact of publications. In this research, the extent to which publish or perish, a long standing evaluation criterion, led to scientific misconduct is examined briefly. After this the strive for high impact publications will be examined, firstly by identifying the period in which this became an important evaluation criterion, secondly by looking at variables contributing to the impact of scholarly papers by means of a non-structured literature study, and lastly by combining these data into a quantitative analysis.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the qualitative and Altmetrics status of 147 journals indexed in the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). This practical-analytical study used qualitative indicators of journals and quantitative Altmetrics. Data was collected from Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports, and Altmetrics Explorer. The results showed that most of the journals this database covers are from European countries, and only one is from Asian countries. More than half of the reviewed journals have a score lower than average regarding Journal Citation Indicator, Eigenfactor Score, and Article influence score. In addition, 63 % of journals cite articles published less than 19 years ago. Nearly 20 % of journals were not on social media. There is a significant relationship between Journal Citation Indicator indices with Citing Half-life, Article influence score with Eigenfactor Score, and between qualitative and Altmetrics indicators. Most of the reviewed journals showed low-quality performance. These journals needed high scientific impact to increase their credibility and quality and remain in the Web of Science database.

AB  - This study explored use restrictions found in licensed scholarly resources from the fields of history/art history, engineering, and health sciences. The analysis developed a framework of use restrictions that distinguishes between soft restrictions—which discourage use—and hard restrictions—which strictly prevent use. Soft restrictions include: extent of use, obfuscation, omission, amalgamation, frustration, and warning. The study concludes that these soft restrictions are relatively common in licensed scholarly resources. Further, while hard restrictions are less common, they are not unknown. The study questions whether librarians should be doing more to challenge use restrictions.

AB  - This article uses Google Scholar (GS) as a source of data to analyse Open Access (OA) levels across all countries and fields of research. All articles and reviews with a DOI and published in 2009 or 2014 and covered by the three main citation indexes in the Web of Science (2,269,022 documents) were selected for study. The links to freely available versions of these documents displayed in GS were collected. To differentiate between more reliable (sustainable and legal) forms of access and less reliable ones, the data extracted from GS was combined with information available in DOAJ, CrossRef, OpenDOAR, and ROAR. This allowed us to distinguish the percentage of documents in our sample that are made OA by the publisher (23.1%, including Gold, Hybrid, Delayed, and Bronze OA) from those available as Green OA (17.6%), and those available from other sources (40.6%, mainly due to ResearchGate). The data shows an overall free availability of 54.6%, with important differences at the country and subject category levels. The data extracted from GS yielded very similar results to those found by other studies that analysed similar samples of documents, but employed different methods to find evidence of OA, thus suggesting a relative consistency among methods.

AB  - Sharing research data and scholarship is of national importance because of the increased focus on maximizing return on the U.S. government's investment in research programs. Recent government policy changes have directly affected the management and accessibility of publically funded research. On January 18, 2011, the National Science Foundation, a U.S. agency that supports research and education in nonmedical fields, required that data management plans be submitted with all grant proposals. On February 22, 2013, the U.S. President's Office of Science and Technology Policy extended a similar requirement for all federal agencies with research and development budgets of more than $100 million. These requirements illustrate the need for further coordination and management of data as scholarship with traditional publications. Purdue University Libraries and its Joint Transportation Research Program (JTRP) collaborated to develop a comprehensive work flow that links technical report production with the management and publication of associated data. This paper illustrates early initiatives to integrate discrete data publications with traditional scholarly publications by leveraging new and existing repository platforms and services. The authors review government policies, past data-sharing practices, early pilot initiatives, and work flow integration between Purdue's data repository, the traditional press, and institutional repository. Through the adoption of these work flows, the authors propose best practices for integrating data publishing and dissemination into the research process. The implementation of this model has the potential to assist researchers in meeting the requirements of federal funding agencies, while reducing redundancy, ensuring integrity, expanding accessibility, and increasing the return on research investment.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this article, we summarize the cost implications of print and electronic publishing for scientific scholarly journal publishers, libraries, and scientists. In each case, we developed detailed cost models to demonstrate the importance of factors that affect publishing and decisions made by libraries and scientists to determine whether to subscribe to a journal; if so, in print or electronic medium, and, if not, what alternative information sources to use. In all instances, estimates of unit cost are essential for understanding the dynamics of the economic and systemic interdependencies of publishers, libraries, and readers.

AB  - Along with the increasing use of the Internet, scholarly publishing was affected by the rise of 'predatory journals'. Many authors attribute the success of these journals to the open access provided to potential readers. While many authors have attempted to propose criteria for identifying predatory journals, very little research was directed to explaining their success, and underlying strategies. This study uses a biological sciences perspective, based on the five stages of predation, and examines the strategies accordingly. The results indicate that predatory journals use the same strategies as all Internet-based scams in identifying their prey. The largest number of strategies addresses approaching the authors. The recent trends include personalized call for papers, use of fake metrics, hijacking reputed journals, faking location and editorial structure, addressing a broad range of topics and providing fast services (at the expense of quality). In addition to these strategies, publishing fees are often hidden. In summary, the pressure to publish and metrics-based career advancement procedures are the main attractors driving authors to predatory journals, despite the efforts of scientists and Internet-based means of identifying these journals and publicizing their dishonest practices.

AB  - This country case study describes how science policy instruments are designed to shape publication patterns and identifies the changes in researchers' productivity that can be observed over the period 2009–2016 in Poland by analysing data on 452,277 publications submitted to the country's national research evaluation system. Our analysis reveals that policy instruments used in the country's national research evaluation system, academic promotion procedures and competitive grants have increased the number of articles with an impact factor without compromising publication quality, as measured by a bibliometric indicator. Our findings highlight that only clear and stable incentives have influenced researchers' publications. Therefore, patterns in scholarly book publications—for which regulations were not clear and stable—have not been significantly shaped by science policy.

AB  - The word ‘predatory’ has become an obstacle to a serious discussion of publishing practices. Its use has been both overinclusive, encompassing practices that, while undesirable, are not malicious, and underinclusive, missing many exploitative practices outside the open access sphere. The article examines different business models for scholarly publishing and considers the potential for abuse with each model. After looking at the problems of both blacklists and so-called ‘whitelists’, the author suggests that the best path forward would be to create tools to capture the real experience of individual authors as they navigate the publishing process with different publishers.

AB  - Abstract Academic publishers now market their most prestigious journals as commercial brands. This paper investigates this trend in the scholarly publishing market, by analyzing how the successive owners of the journal Nature have capitalized on its reputation to generate additional profits to those already accumulated through university library subscriptions. Two branding strategies of the journal Nature are analyzed: the first one, product line extension, consists in extending the Nature brand in the same product category, by creating an ever‐increasing number of derived Nature journals; the second one, brand extension, consists in extending the Nature brand to other categories of products and services, such as academic rankings, sponsored supplements, feature advertisements, or webinars and trainings. The Nature brand leveraging strategy has been imitated by many other journal publishers. These branded products and services are well suited to the particular dynamics of the scientific field, which is based on the continuous quest for recognition. They are thus sold at all stages of the research cycle, from writing grants to popularizing research results, to scientists and academic institutions competing to accumulate symbolic capital. In this respect, academic publishers that engage in scholarly journal branding contribute to the transformation of the scientific ‘community’ into a scientific market.

Addressing different areas within music therapy and the broader field of musical care (Sanfilippo &amp; Spiro, 2022), the articles encompass a clinical case study of music therapy with a child in Israel (Nir Seri) as well as original research studies regarding music-for-health practices in paediatric hospitals in the UK (Jessica Tomlinson and John Habron), the role of music listening in chronic pain and anxiety management (Marie Strand Skånland), as well as the lived experiences of six music therapists who identify as having hearing loss (Sara Cole and Catherine Warner). The theme of music listening and hearing loss is explored further through an interview with Paul Whittaker; a profoundly deaf musician whose work has been devoted to challenging assumptions regarding how people hear and perceive music, and encouraging other deaf people to engage with music. &#x0D; At the 12th European Music Therapy Conference, Approaches took part in a roundtable discussion regarding the role that open access journals can, and perhaps should, play in decolonising music therapy. In discussion with colleagues from the editorial teams of the Australian Journal of Music Therapy, Qualitative Inquiries in Music Therapy, and Voices: A World Forum for Music Therapy, four key areas were identified: accessibility, language, power and diversity, and culture (Tsiris et al., 2022). Critical engagement with these areas is vital in our endeavours to disturb conventional assumptions around scholarly publishing.&#x0D; In Approaches, our team has worked hard over the past year to expand the scope of what we offer. This work has led to the creation of ‘Approaches PLUS,’ a new space on the journal’s website dedicated to the ongoing development and free dissemination of innovative resources. Building on our commitment to an open access culture, Approaches PLUS seeks to foster new forms of knowledge and knowing, and to reach diverse audiences.&#x0D; Launching this new initiative, the first resource published in Approaches PLUS is an English-Greek music therapy dictionary. Its title, Music Therapy Dictionary: A Place of Interdisciplinary Encounters, reflects the dictionary’s vision to create a co-constructed space where the Greek translation of concepts and terms follows an informed process of documentation, rendering, and interpretation. Co-edited by Mitsi Akoyunoglou, Dimitra Papastavrou, Konstantina Katostari, and myself, the first edition of the dictionary contains over 1000 terms and acronyms, as well as 26 entries focusing in greater detail on specific concepts. Authored by 25 authors, these entries followed a peer-review process prior to publication. This process resonates with our work as a bilingual English-Greek journal seeking to promote the ongoing growth of the music therapy discourse in the Greek language in a culturally responsive and sensitive way.&#x0D; The dictionary is intended to be a living resource which is updated regularly, inviting contributions from different authors. Potential authors can submit proposals for new entries as well as suggestions for alternative renditions and translations of terms which can be included in subsequent editions. The peer review process for all entries fosters a dialectical culture where behind-the-scenes translational dilemmas and debates can have direct implications for the advancement of terminology in music therapy.&#x0D; In the coming months, Approaches PLUS will be enriched with other resources in addition to the dictionary. Common ground for all these resources is our vision for promoting new collaborative and community-led publishing approaches in music therapy where multiple voices and different languages are heard and represented. This ongoing development of Approaches is the fruit of teamwork founded in a social approach to leadership (Stodd, 2014) that is shared, creative, and empathetic (dos Santos, 2022). The recent appointment of Andeline dos Santos as co-editor-in-chief of Approaches feeds directly to the leadership of the journal. Andeline brings to this role a wealth of experience as a practitioner, educator, and researcher, and I very much look forward to working with her as a new chapter of Approaches’ life begins!

AB  - Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Session 1358 Experiences with Academic Publishing on the Internet: A Look at the Technology Interface Jeffrey S. Beasley, Charles T. Townley New Mexico State University Abstract This paper discusses the experiences of publishing academic papers through Internet journals such as the Technology Interface. While Internet publishing creates many opportunities for exchanging information, this can also cause concern for ownership, proper cataloging, citing, and archiving. Also, the Internet is a dynamic environment. Many questions arise due to the use of Internet publications. For example, should journal documents be allowed to change once placed on-line? Can a previously published paper be updated? Should guidelines for publishing on the Internet be different than the printed press? Should articles be published in HTML format or another such as Adobe Acrobat? Who should pay for the opportunity to publish on the Internet? This paper will address these issues and includes a discussion of the experiences with the Technology Interface. Introduction Before 1996, only 100 on-line titles of science, technology and medicine (STM) peer-reviewed journals appeared on-line.1 A search on the Internet search engine Yahoo! 2 was conducted January, 1998 using the underlined keywords. The search produced the following results: • Found 266 Category and 4495 Site Matches for journal. • Found 14 Category and 51 Site Matches for journals in engineering, • Found 4 Category and 130 Site Matches for Technology Journals. • Found 3 Category and 418 Site Matches for magazine technology. • Found 0 categories and 2 sites for engineering technology journal Not all of the listings are classified as peer-reviewed journals but the impact the Internet is making on electronic publishing is evident by the number of site matches to the keyword search. The Technology Interface is a recent addition to the long list of providers of electronic information on the Internet. The first issue of the Technology Interface - the Electronic Journal for Engineering Technology appeared on the Internet in November of 1996. The Technology Interface is a paperless on-line publication accessed via the World-Wide Web (WWW). The Technology Interface was developed specifically to provide professionals in the Engineering Technology profession and related fields, the opportunity to share ideas concerning teaching, teaching improvements, projects, industrial activities, research and much more via the Internet. This paperless media provides the convenience for organizations to freely share their information. The journal is now in its second year of publication.

AB  - The paper aims to understand the context and drivers of researchers' decision to submit a manuscript to a journal with questionable practices. Using OMICS as a case study and asking authors for their views, the paper presents their profile, motivations and publishing experiences. The methodology is based on a questionnaire sent by e-mail to all authors of articles in journals published by OMICS (+2200). The authors were asked about (a) the factors that influenced their decision to submit their article; (b) their publishing experience with OMICS; (c) their level of satisfaction; and (d) whether or not they would repeat the experience. A total of 86 responses were collected and 18 e-mails were received. The analysis made it possible to add details to the profiles of authors already identified in the literature, but also allowed new and more nuanced profiles. This research extends our knowledge on the phenomenon of predatory publishing from the authors' feedback and provides a better understanding of the socio-economic, psychosocial and geo-political conditions that drive researchers' decisions to submit their work to a possible, potential, or probable predatory journal. At the same time, it reveals some of the strategies used by OMICS to persuade authors to submit their papers. The findings will help to inform institutional policies that seek to put in place efficient measures to combat predatory publishing.

AB  - Faculty hold widely varying perspectives on the benefits and challenges afforded by open access (OA) publishing. In the United States, conversations on OA models and strategy have been dominated by scholars affiliated with Carnegie R1 institutions. This article reports findings from interviews conducted with faculty at a Carnegie R2 institution, highlighting disciplinary and individual perspectives on the high costs and rich rewards afforded by OA. The results reiterate the persistence of a high degree of skepticism regarding the quality of peer review and business models associated with OA publishing. By exploring scholars' perceptions of and experiences with OA publishing and their comfort using or sharing unpublished, publicly available content, the authors highlight the degree to which OA approaches must remain flexible, iterative and multifaceted – no single solution can begin to accommodate the rich and varying needs of individual stakeholders.

AB  - This article reports the results of a 2019 survey of academic librarians that investigated their attitudes, practices, and policies regarding open access (OA). This study asks if academic librarians write policies to ensure that they approach OA intentionally and systematically across all library services. The results indicate that, though librarians report favorable beliefs about OA and integrating OA into technical and public services, they seldom create OA policies.

AB  - ABSTRACT “Open data” is a popular phrase in research practice and science policy. While stakeholders agree on some aspects of this concept, many others remain hotly debated. As a means to identify the main themes and arguments surrounding open data, we analyzed highly cited publications from the last 10 years that address data sharing or open access to research data. We identify and synthesize eight components of open data that vary among policies, studies, and initiatives, and present problematic arguments worthy of further investigation.

AB  - Prior studies show gaps in using the Zoom application for language learning with various perceptions of language learning. This study attempts to reveal students' perceptions of using the Zoom Cloud Meeting Application in teaching and learning reading classes at one of the universities in Malang. Therefore, the descriptive qualitative approach was adopted for this study. The researcher collected data using a questionnaire adapted prior study (Suadi, 2021). The findings of this study suggest that the virtual reading lesson offered via the Zoom application to students majoring in communication science at one of the universities in Malang was highly welcomed by students. Aside from that, pupils thought the Zoom application might help them improve their reading skills and overcome their shyness in virtual classroom interactions. This finding further illuminates the discrepancies in students' perceptions, which may serve as consideration for using the Zoom application in teaching and learning reading.

AB  - This empirical study examines long-term and current book market trends and important factors affecting scholarly book prices in science, technology, and medicine (STM). It analyzes the market demand, supply, and prices of STM books and how they affect academic libraries' budgets. A semilogarithmic econometric model is formulated to explore the factors that affect STM book prices. Various product features, including book length, cover type, format, supplier types, and publication locations, are examined. The empirical results are mostly statistically significant, particularly for some key factors. The overall findings of this study have policy implications for academic libraries' books collections and acquisitions.

AB  - The Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) is a prominent open access (OA) publisher that uses article processing charges (APCs) as its business model. Our objective was to determine the association between the APCs levied by MDPI journals and 1) their inclusion in Scopus and Web of Science databases or 2) their stature, as represented by their CiteScore (Elsevier&amp;rsquo;s Scopus) and Impact Factor (awarded by Clarivate Analytics). Among the 227 journals published by MDPI, 51 had both IF and CiteScore; 107, only a CiteScore; and 84, neither IF nor CiteScore. The charges levied by the journals varied widely, from 0 to CHF 2000 (Swiss francs), the most frequent figure (159 journals) being CHF 1000, or about &amp;euro;930. The amount of APCs was found to be correlated to IF (R&amp;sup2; = 0.64; p &lt;0.001; 107 journals) and also to CiteScore (R&amp;sup2; = 0.619; p &lt;0.001; 53 journals). The charges levied by journals that had both IF and CiteScore were significantly higher than those charged by journals with neither IF nor CiteScore (p &lt;0.05). The charges were also correlated to the age of the journal: the more recently launched journals charged less than the older journals did.

AB  - INTRODUCTION The video abstract has emerged in recent years as a new way of communicating the results of scholarly enquiry. For library-based journal publishers who want to support multimodal scholarship, it is useful to understand the potential benefit and impact of incorporating video abstracts into their publications. This paper provides an overview of the growth of video abstracts in science scholarship, and presents a single journal case study that compares the use and potential impact of video abstracts hosted on both YouTube and on a journal’s own website. METHODS For the case study, video abstract usage data for the New Journal of Physics (NJP) was gathered from both YouTube and the NJP native platform and then correlated using a Spearman rank correlation coefficient test to analyze viewing usage. Viewership data from both platforms was also correlated with article usage counts using Spearman to study the relationship between article usage and corresponding video abstract usage. RESULTS Users predominantly accessed the journal’s hosted video abstracts instead of the abstracts posted on YouTube. However, there was a moderate positive correlation comparing view counts of the same video abstracts across both platforms, suggesting proportionate use of both platforms. In addition, the top 25 and 100 read articles had a significantly higher presence of video abstracts than articles overall in the data set, although a specific reason for that relationship cannot be identified. DISCUSSION &amp;amp; CONCLUSION Video abstracts are a natural evolution of science communication into multimodal environments. Publishing trends will likely continue to grow gradually, with appreciation for non-traditional scholarship (multimodal scholarship) and new measures for assessing impact (altmetrics) potentially encouraging greater adoption. Librarybased journal publishers should consider investing in software that offers dynamic media integration, offering the video abstract option to their authors, and leveraging YouTube to further raise the visibility of their authors’ research articles and publication. Library-based publishers should have some expectation that the video abstracts will be viewed relatively proportionally across platforms (i.e. a video abstract that receives a higher or lower view count on the journal’s website is moderately more likely to also receive a higher or lower view count on YouTube), with the majority of total views (for all videos) coming from the journal’s website. Subject and media librarians should become more aware of these emerging practices to support the video abstract publication and creation needs of their research communities.

AB  - &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; We present a first estimate of the extent of predatory publishing amongst South African academics. This estimate is based on an analysis of all South African authored papers that qualified for subsidy over the period 2005 to 2014. The analysis shows that 4246 South African papers were published in 48 journals which we re-classified (refining Beall’s classification) as either being probably or possibly predatory. A breakdown of these papers by year shows that the greatest increase in predatory publishing has occurred since 2011. Results are also presented of the distribution of these papers by individual university and scientific field. We conclude with some suggestions about predatory publishing and its pervasive consequence for our trust in science and how this should be addressed by the major stakeholders in the South African higher education system.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Significance: &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; This study is the first to analyse the extent of predatory publishing in South Africa.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;

AB  - W hen I was first contemplating this column, and a similar set of comments I made at the ACRL/SPARC Forum at the 2006 ALA Mid winter Meeting in San Antonio, I was tempted to use an extended Lord of the Rings metaphor.In this metaphor, copyright is the Tolkien trilogy's ring-of inestimable value and bestowing great power on its possessor.Lawerence Lessig, of the Creative Commons, is Frodo, with the hopes of many riding on his efforts as he carries the ring to a place where it will be, well, not destroyed, but transformed.Take your pick of any num ber of avaricious publishers to be Gollum, the conflicted character whose spirit has become wellblackened, wily, severe, and tailored to do nothing but covet the precious ring.Conveniently, for our metaphor, Gollum has two warring selves, the one driven by pure greed, and the one who wants to do right by the fellowship made up of faculty (hob bits and "men"), scholarly societies (elves), nonprofit publishers (dwarves), and librarians (wizards), i.e., the ones who want a healthy scholarly communication environment for its own sake.But there is that pesky profi tmoti vated Gollum, too.And the fellowship simply wants the power, including the economic power that comes with the copyright ring, to be balanced in a way that allows knowledge to progress and be made available to future knowledge producers in a "sustainable" way.The fellowship wants a balance so that the pastoral shire of teaching, learning, research, and societal progress fl ourishes, unburdened by constraints on how research is noncom mercially shared and used, or by crippling prices that deny access to the research results for many in the fi rst place.But, in addition to my limitations as a deconstructionist of mid20thcentury fi ction, and despite the possible entertainment value, no metaphor can be extended far enough to fairly characterize the motivations and contri butions of various stakeholders, or to do justice to the complexity of even the small corner of copyright that relates to scholarly publishing.

AB  - Access to scholarship in the health sciences has greatly increased in the last decade. The adoption of the 2008 U.S. National Institutes of Health Public Access Policy and the launch of successful open access journals in health sciences have done much to move the exchange of scholarship beyond the subscription-only model. One might assume, therefore, that scholars publishing in the health sciences would be more supportive of these changes. However, the results of this survey of attitudes on a campus with a large medical faculty show that health science respondents were uncertain of the value of recent changes in the scholarly communication system.

AB  - As scientists' means of communication and information behaviors have evolved over the past several decades due to computing and networking developments, the field of library and information science (LIS) has responded by surveying their changing practices. This study continues this type of research but switches focus away from scientists' use of journal articles, the dominant means by which research libraries have supported their investigations, and instead concentrates on scientists' practices related to data. The view of scientists as increasingly energetic generators, managers, and users of large and growing electronic datasets has lately been recognized and promoted at the societal level by funding agencies, academic societies, and large research centers. The growth in data production and storage related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research has been attributed to the development and proliferation of enabling technologies and computer networks associated with cyberinfrastructure advancement, including sensors and sensor networks, high-throughput technologies and instrumentation, automated data acquisition, and computational modeling and simulation. (NSF, 2007) While the technical and societal forces encouraging scientists to produce this born-digital content continue unabated, attention to their resulting burden of managing this content for access and use has lagged behind. LIS-trained practitioners could contribute information management infrastructure to aid scientists but this infrastructure would have to be oriented to the variety of local, idiosyncratic, field-based approaches currently extant. (Borgman, 2007) A campus-wide census of data management practices at a Carnegie Classification Research II institution identifies what the variety of faculty data management practices is across the STEM departments. LIS researchers have studied scientists to understand their information behaviors in a changing scholarly publishing environment. For instance, Brown (1999) polled faculty in four disciplines, Astronomy, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics, at her home institution to gather comparative data about their use of and attitudes about electronic versus print journal articles in relation to the academic library. Tenopir and her colleagues (2005) have teased out differences in the rate and manner that scientists in particular disciplines consume online versus print journal articles to conduct their research via multiple, sampled surveys that target a large number of members of the field's dominant academic society, and then comparing the results to other similar studies. Zhang (2001) surveyed authors of articles published in eight scholarly journals covering the LIS field to determine how Internet-based electronic resources were considered during the preparation of their articles. To help get the most out of computer-based data resulting from the increasing amount of scientific investigation facilitated through cyberinfrastructure, funding agencies in both the U.S. and the U.K. are investing in projects that develop data preservation and management tools and skills. One such effort, the Science Data Literacy (SDL) project at the iSchool at Syracuse University, has been funded by the National Science Foundation to develop a course designed to prepare students with basic knowledge and skills in science data management. In a similar manner as the earlier surveys of scientist information behaviors, the SDL staff as an early part of the project prepared a survey vehicle and conducted a census of the relevant campus faculty. The project team took a pragmatic approach in crossing disciplinary boundaries in order to gather the variety of data management practices in STEM departments across the home institution. Departments were identified that reasonably fell within the rough boundaries provided by the STEM category amalgam; SDL staff erred on the side of including the most number of researchers likely to be accumulating and working with primary datasets. In consultation with iSchool faculty practiced at survey construction, SDL staff created a survey vehicle and pilot-tested it on members of the SDL project advisory board who matched the target population. Terminology had to be negotiated and definitions provided to orient concepts from information science to the scholars' research process. For example, we eliminated the word "metadata" from the questionnaire and added an inclusive definition of data from a National Science Board report (2005) in the introduction to the survey: "any information that can be stored in digital form, including text, numbers, images, video or movies, audio, software, algorithms, equations, animations, models, simulations, etc." Demographic questions particular to the discipline-focused and hierarchical environment of the academic community were taken from the Higher Education Research Institute's faculty performance survey (2004). As per Janes' (1999) helpful advice on survey construction, this demographic data-gathering section was placed at the end. The iterative process of question phrasing and grouping led to a refined instrument designed to capture data management practices. The four-part, web-based survey featured Likert-scale agreement questions related to attitudes, practices, and experience with research data. Two provocative questions about data management in the respondent's discipline were designed not only to motivate participants to express their views, but also to help establish the presupposition of the questionnaire that the respondent was a data producer (Martin, 2006). This rather brute force technique was designed to concentrate the mind of the respondent on their data management practices, but may have had unknown effects on the target population. An initial branching question may have been more effective at weeding out members of the STEM departments who, due to a teaching, practical, or theoretical orientation, did not manage data. In the meat of the survey, branching questions also would have allowed researchers to record more than one management or preservation practice, but the instrument provided for this purpose the ability for the participant to mark multiple options per response where appropriate to simplify the survey design. Textboxes and open-ended questions in each section were meant to elicit a range of practices with data as well as overall reactions provoked by the 25 questions. Syracuse University, in combination with the symbiotically connected campus of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, has over a thousand full-time faculty members; the SDL survey was administered to 362 faculty members from STEM departments at the two institutions. Respondents received a movie ticket coupon as consideration for their time. Possible participants were identified via information posted on school and department websites and then contacted via email solicitation, notification and up to two reminders. Faculty members were given the opportunity to opt out—many did citing current retirement status or lack of involvement in research. As it was a local census using a MySQL-based token response system, anonymity was not an option, so entries are being kept in confidence and analysis is ongoing. Of those who participated resulting in a 30.7 percent response rate, problems that might affect the census results include a lack of alignment of the respondent with data-producing aspects of STEM research pursuits, such as a solely theoretical orientation in physics and mathematics, or a social orientation in the case of geography and information science. Additionally, faculty who handle different types of data per research project, faculty organized in research groups, and faculty use of research assistants as day-to-day handlers of data are conditions that may have interfered with an accurate and complete perception of data management practices from the survey responses obtained. Table 1 indicates some of the variety encountered in data management practices throughout the STEM departments. A value closer to five indicates strong agreement that the researcher responding is a frequent data producer, used data prepared by another researcher, was aware that the digital data may be used by another researcher outside his or her own group, prepared metadata of some kind for the internally produced datasets, and found metadata entries helpful when obtaining data for use from external research groups. All entries could have been the respondent answering as a representative of his or her research group. Table 2 shows the relation in responses between those researchers who work with a certain size dataset and their perception of the effect of data management practices on their discipline's progress. Researchers who operate with larger datasets appear more confident about their discipline's data management practices. Table 3 relates actions routinely taken by researchers with their data and with their agreement on the negative impact that inadequate data preservation practices are having on their discipline. It appears that researchers involved in advanced data activity such as calculation and visualization may be slightly more sanquine about their discipline's preservation practices. Continuing analysis will show the variations in management and preservation practice, according to faculty affiliation and position. This will allow mapping of local institutional attitudes and behaviors regarding data to those encouraged by major research initiatives at the disciplinary and national level. It is anticipated that results from this survey will help the SDL project team, and the LIS field more generally, understand how to integrate SDL education with STEM departments actively working with science data, as well as develop educational materials at an appropriate level to assist meeting the need for personnel with the skills and interest in science data management and preservation to support effective community and disciplinary use of these digital resources. On a more basic level, it will help provide information on how science and technology researchers obtain and manage their data as part of knowledge production and science communication processes.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which teaching staff cooperated with librarians in collection development, specifically in relation to electronic resources, and to identify barriers they encountered while performing collection development activities. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods approach was adopted for the study. Quantitative and qualitative techniques of data collection and analysis were used to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the research topic. Data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire and interviews. A total of 149 faculty members completed the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 51.2%, while 16 library staff members were interviewed to obtain qualitative data. Findings The majority of the teaching staff who participated in the study affirmed that they had cooperated with subject librarians in collection development. A high percentage (62.4%) of the faculty members had collaborated with subject librarians in collection development activities. Only 37.6% of the faculty members had not participated in collection development activities with subject librarians to acquire library electronic resources. According to faculty members, some of the main challenges affecting collection development at the University of Namibia were a lack of catalogues for electronic resources and a lack of lists of titles from vendors. Moreover, librarians were not always available to assist faculty members. It is recommended that faculty members be part of the process of selecting materials and that a good relationship be fostered between librarians and faculty members to bring value to collection development activities. Originality/value Collection development in respect of electronic resources is a complex process to be undertaken by a single entity and, therefore, requires the collaboration of all stakeholders involved. In the case of institutions of higher learning, these stakeholders include faculty, librarians and vendors. The emergence of a variety of e-resources demands a meticulous strategy on the part of libraries to ensure they can offer a wide range of up-to-date and accurate resources that meet the evolving needs of their users. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, studies that are similar to this one have not been conducted in Namibia before. This case study presents useful findings and lessons on faculty–librarian cooperation for effective collection development, not only at the University of Namibia library but also at other academic libraries in economies with similar characteristics.

C1  - OpenEdition
AB  - The FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) constitute a guide whose aim is to improve the management of digital scholarly resources. Nevertheless, the literature regarding data services other than data repositories is still scarce.OpenEdition is a digital infrastructure for open scholarly communication in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) that carried out an internal full review to assess the degree of FAIRness of its activities. The objective of this paper is to present the methodology employed by OpenEdition’s team and the recommendations for the FAIRification of a publishing system, and hence, the elements for the FAIR Publishing Toolkit. The FAIR review was conducted in three main phases: preparation, assessment, and result phase, which listed the recommendations for the FAIR principles implementation. The preparation phase gathered the available information to define the perimeter of the FAIR review. It comprised two steps: the landscape study and the exam of actual use cases. The assessment phase contextualized the FAIR principles according to the scholarly publishing context, defined the datasets to be analyzed, carried outa FAIR maturity review per dataset, and analyzed the state of the art of some important FAIR-related elements. The result phase produced the recommendations, organized as priorities and extended objectives. The priority recommendations regard persistent identifiers and licensing policies. The extended objectives focus on authors' information management, controlled vocabularies, machine-actionability, and Digital Management Plans.

AB  - There are at least two dimensions to the transformation in the character of scholarly publishing and the correlative shift in the networked conditions of production of scholarly work.The scope and scale of material available has radically increased and the mechanisms of judging scholarly value have been increasingly refined.Yet, we have not done enough to critically reflect on what these transformations have done to the experience of producing scholarly work.I am referring to the simple way that everyday activities of scholarship have been transformed.An obvious example is the practice of carrying out a literature review.This brief essay presents some notes on literature review preparation and abstract writing from the perspective of a mid-career academic who is committed to assisting their research students.It then argues there are two new meta-professional skills required of scholars to function in academia and in which our research students need to develop expertise.What if we could problematise the 'project' (or 'projectify' the problem)?Rather than the coordinates of the project being determined by the administrative burden of measurement and correlative productivity according to maximum gradients of anxiety (the neoliberal academic model), what if the 'project' was configured as an instrument for suspending practices of discovery according to the maximum gradients of curiosity (the post-neoliberal academic model)?This is the difference between passive and active affections that befall scholars as they are socialised as academics.

AB  - Abstract This analysis of 229 editorials and opinion pieces published in science and medical journals explores the affective discourses used to characterise so‐called predatory publishing. Most (84%, n = 193) deploy one or more of three related categories of metaphorical and figurative language (fear, fakery and exploitation) to strengthen their rhetorical case. This paper examines the deployment, co‐occurrence and amplification of this language across the science publishing system, focusing particularly on the role of major science journals in adopting and normalising this emotive discourse. The analysis shows how few editorials offer alternative perspectives on these developments (n = 9), and their relative invisibility in scholarly debates.

Originally intended as a showcase for faculty scholarship, it has evolved to serve also as a university press for original journals and newsletters, and as an institutional archive. Many lessons have been learned about marketing techniques, common IR issues, and advantages of an IR for a library. IR recruitment has come to be viewed as yet another form of collection development and has been integrated into all forms of the Library's outreach. Jefferson's academic health sciences environment has proven similar to other academic environments on issues of acceptance and participation.

AB  - Much of the debate on Plan S seems to concentrate on how to make toll-access journals open access, taking for granted that existing open access journals are Plan S-compliant. We suspected this was not so and set out to explore this using Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) metadata. We conclude that a large majority of open access journals are not Plan S-compliant, and that it is small publishers in the humanities and social sciences (HSS) not charging article processing charges (APC) that will face the largest challenge with becoming compliant. Plan S needs to give special considerations to smaller publishers and/or non-APC based journals.

AB  - Watch the VIDEO of the presentation.“Fight academic apartheid to advance equality and quality in the sciences!”“Stop discriminating against Open Access publications in research evaluation.”“The next generation of researchers will care less about status and more about relevance.”These are some of the voices from Europe’s rectors, vice-chancellors, professors, senior and junior researchers on what still needs to be done to achieve more Open Access.Despite seeing significant international and national Open Access policy development across Europe, both the library and academic communities are still having challenges in implementing Open Access policies on various levels. We can anticipate far more OA take-up when the research community and senior administration votes with their feet against traditional publishing practices and for new forms. In addition, these groups have the power to stabilise and strengthen the sustainability of such change by changing the way that research is currently being assessed and evaluated. It is for this reason that SPARC Europe is highlighting the importance of the people in our research communities who are helping make Open Access happen and who are speaking out for such change.SPARC Europe is doing this by bringing champions together in an online showcase, Europe’s Open Access Champions. This features a range of academics and senior administrators or champions who are making the case for Open Access amongst their peers. They are generating more momentum for more access to Europe’s research results within their research communities. They tell us why and how – in their own words – on the Europe’s Open Access Champions site.In the first instance, this presentation will share a range of complementary but also very different views from champions from various research roles, disciplines and countries. What needs to be done to change the current scholarly publishing system in their view? Where does academic integrity come in and how can more OA here potentially affect research careers / employment conditions? Above all, how can the academic community make the necessary change to the way research is currently assessed and evaluated to make OA work? The presentation will then go on to share lessons learnt by various libraries across Europe on what makes a good OA champion.To conclude, this presentation seeks to inspire the open scholarly communication community to engage more with champions from the research community who have the potential to make more rapid Open Access to Europe’s research results.

AB  - Abstract This paper discusses user needs for a system that indexes tables and figures culled from scientific journal articles. These findings are taken from a comprehensive investigation into scientists' satisfaction with and use of a tables and figures retrieval prototype. Much previous research has examined the usability and features of digital libraries and other online retrieval systems that retrieve either full‐text of journal articles, traditional article‐level abstracts, or both. In contrast, this paper examines the needs of users directly searching for and accessing discrete journal article components – figures, tables, graphs, maps, and photographs – that have been individually indexed.

AB  - The open access model, defined here as free access to scholarly publishing, has emerged alongside the traditional, subscription-based model for publishing medical journals [1–3]. The open access model was developed largely in response to rapidly rising subscription prices [4, 5], which raised concerns about access to scientific research, especially that funded by public entities [2]. In 2003, Public Library of Science (PLoS) launched a nonprofit scientific and publishing venture producing open access journals with no charge for access and, other than appropriate citation, no restrictions on use [6]. Funders of biomedical research, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), also pushed for open access to research they support. In 2007, the NIH public access policy was signed into law, requiring that all investigators funded by NIH have an electronic version of their final manuscripts publicly available within twelve months of publication [2].Despite the emergence of open access, knowledge of the finances of medical journal publishers is limited [4]. Published reports have surveyed open access journals, described their business models, and reported their finances [1, 7] but have been limited by their scope or have been disproportionately weighted away from for-profit publishers [1]. This study therefore sought to increase understanding of the finances of the publishers of the most highly cited US general and internal medicine journals by examining the tax status, revenue, expenses, and operating margins in order to inform public debate and policy.

AB  - About half of Library and Information Science (LIS) journals continue to charge authors to publish articles open access (OA) or do not offer OA publishing at all. To further investigate the financial and other perceived barriers preventing these LIS journals from transitioning to no-publishing fee OA models, this exploratory project surveyed lead editors for each identified LIS journal. Results indicate most of the journals have not discussed transitioning to a no-publishing fee OA model, and that finances are the main barrier. Most also indicated a lack of awareness of their journal's budget. The most popular no-publishing fee OA model was Subscribe to Open.

AB  - Abstract Institutional repositories are “digital collections that capture and preserve the intellectual output of universities” (Crow, 2002 ). While still in their initial stages of development, much attention has been paid to the technical and administrative components. This paper examines the usability of the interfaces of two of the most commonly used institutional repository systems: DSpace and Eprints. By using heuristic evaluation and usability testing, eighteen undergraduate students were tested using a between subjects experimental design. Measures included time for completing tasks, the number of errors, and users' satisfaction from post‐test questionnaires. Results of the study indicated that DSpace users spent less time completing tasks and made fewer errors than Eprints users. Overall satisfaction of DSpace was also higher than Eprints. Based on this analysis of problem areas, the study suggests guidelines for institutional repository interfaces.

AB  - This Report from the Field introduces a collaboratively authored set of documentation that compares digital publishing platforms that are typically used by library publishers. This report discusses how we created this set of crosswalks that compare 10 publishing platforms, most of which are academy-owned and open-source. These platforms are used to create eBooks, digital humanities projects, journals, collections, and community projects, and the crosswalks compare a set of common features each has, including hosting options and cost, ingestion options, interactivity, archive and preservation features, export options, accessibility, and other features. We walk readers through how to use this Creative-Commons-licensed tool to compare platforms, features, and project types, with the hopes that users (be they librarians or authors) can easily compare and make decisions about which platform might best suit their publishing needs.

AB  - Objective. The authors study: 1) the level of awareness of librarians of Ukrainian universities about Open Educational Resources (OER); 2) the ability of librarians to provide support services for the development, creation and use of OER in teaching, learning, research. Methods. The study was conducted by methods of analysis of professional literature, online survey (questionnaires) and analysis of the results. The questionnaires “Library of Higher Education Institution in Support of Distance Learning: Open Educational Resources” was distributed from 20.04. until 20.05.2021 among 137 directors of libraries of higher education institutions of Ukraine. Responses came from 77 libraries. The questionnaire consisted of 9 open-ended and closed-ended questions to allow researchers to get a holistic picture of the research process. Results. The analysis of 77 questionnaires showed that the vast majority of free HEI libraries in Ukraine have extensive experience in working with electronic educational resources. Ranking by resource type prove that 95.89% of library collections are the own generation resources (HEI authors): databases, incl. repositories. The concept of "Open Educational Resources" (OERs) is familiar and understandable to 84.42% of respondents. At the same time, 75.32% are already involved in supporting the OER. Librarians may catalog them (21.92%) or not catalog (32.88%). Among the OER types supported by librarians, educational materials (77.05%) and textbooks (55.74%) predominate. The closest partnership of librarians in OER support (except for teachers) is with the specialists of IT services (66.13%). Conclusions. Despite the still spontaneous, chaotic and little-studied nature of the library movement towards OER, librarians are well aware of this issue. At the same time, 96.1% of respondents want to improve their competencies in the direction of supporting open educational resources. This is very important, because it is the understanding and acceptance of OER that is crucial for a long-term vision of this movement. That is why specific aspects, such as organizational, economic, personnel and motivational, need urgent further study.

AB  - Economists have done most to innovate scholarly publishing and communication by switching to Open Access. In cultural studies, history, law, political science and sociology, Open Access publishing is still an innovation at the margins. Yet Open Access is demonstrably the superior publishing model in the WWW Galaxy. Research networks, scholarly communities and academic tribes would do well to consider how to switch their communication and publishing to Open Access. The penalty for failing to do this will be decreased visibility and diminished impact, followed ultimately by a decline in public and philanthropic funding. For everyone, this article outlines the compelling reasons to switch to OA. Moreover, we have a common agenda when it comes to the means whereby Open Access is achieved. We will all suffer if a sub-optimal lock-in occurs and innovation spaces are blocked. Therefore, full and partial OA solutions are evaluated. There is also a genuine need for collaboration when it comes to developing the next generation of overlay services such as literature awareness tools, information mining tools and search engines.

AB  - This review critically examines five international scholarly publishers that publish academic journals using the gold (author pays) Open Access model. The author-pays model is changing scholarly publishing because authors, rather than libraries or other subscribers, become the publishers' customers, an arrangement that creates a built in conflict of interest. The more articles a publisher accepts, the more revenue it earns. New gold Open Access publishers are appearing almost weekly, and many are engaged in unethical practices. The review covers four predatory publishers, Academy Publish, BioInfo, ScienceDomain International, and Scientific Research Publishing, and one legitimate publisher, AOSIS Open Journals.

The UMass Amherst Libraries provide a case study of an academic library collection that is pivoting from materials produced by proprietary publishers to a mix of investments in unique and special collections; open access publishing, content and infrastructure; and materials published through traditional channels.

AB  - At Leiden University, it is increasingly recognised that effective data management forms an integral component of responsible research. To actively promote the stewardship of all the research data that are produced at Leiden University, a comprehensive, institution-wide programme was launched in 2015, which centrally aims to encourage its researchers to carefully plan the temporal storage, long-term preservation and potential reuse of their data. This programme, which is managed centrally by the Department of Academic Affairs, and which receives important contributions from academic staff, from Leiden University Libraries, and from the University's central ICT organisation, basically consists of three parts. Firstly, a basic central policy has been formulated, containing clear guidelines for activities before, during and after research projects. The central aim of this institutional policy is to ensure that all Leiden-based research projects can effectively comply with the most common requirements stipulated by funding agencies, academic publishers, the Dutch standard evaluation protocol and the European data protection directive. As a second part of the data management programme, faculties have organised workshops and meetings, concentrating on the rationale and on the technical and organisational practicalities of effective data management in order to bring about a discipline-specific protocol. Data librarians employed by Leiden University Libraries have developed educational materials and provide training for PhDs in the principles and benefits of good data management. Thirdly, to ensure that scholars can genuinely make a reasoned selection among the many tools that are currently available, a central catalogue was developed which lists and characterises the most relevant data management services. The catalogue currently provides information about, amongst many other aspects, the organisations behind these services, the main academic disciplines which are targeted and the accepted file formats and metadata formats. The various aspects of these facilities have been classified using terminology provided by conceptual models developed by the UKDA, ANDS and the DCC. Using Leiden University's policy guidelines as criteria, the overall suitability of each service has also been evaluated. Leiden University's data management programme has a total duration of three years, and its basic objective is to offer a comprehensive form of support, in which the data management policy which is propagated centrally is complemented by various forms of assistance which ought to make it easier for scholars to adhere to this policy. The catalogue of data management services also aims to bolster the implementation of an adequate technical infrastructure, as the qualitative evaluations of the services enable policy-makers and developers to quickly establish gaps or other shortcomings within existing facilities.

AB  - Omnia uno tempore erant agenda (All things were to be done at one time) — Julius Caesar on how to deal with the challenges of multiple and complex operations. —Thorne 2007. The universe of scholarly publishing includes more than 30,000 peer-reviewed journals in the sciences and humanities (Ware and Mabe 2015), approximately 250 of which cover the aquatic sciences. Establishing a new journal within this large universe poses considerable challenges and risks, but also provides valuable opportunities for scientific societies. The leaders of the Association for the Sciences of Limnology & Oceanography (ASLO) took a risk in 2014 by founding a new journal, Limnology & Oceanography Letters (L&O Letters). The first article was published in 2016, and, as of 2020, early signs indicate that this risk is paying off—the journal's debut impact factor was 5.2 (Fig. 1), ranking #1 in Limnology and #2 in Oceanography in 2019. Other indicators of early success include trends of increasing article downloads and citations (Fig. 2), articles receiving exceptional Altmetric Attention Scores (e.g., a score of 968 for Hotaling 2020), and many early-career researchers embracing the journal as both authors and reviewers. Many new journals fail, so how was L&O Letters conceived and what were the keys to its early success? We address these questions with two purposes, first to share personal retrospectives on the journal's early history, including its conception and launch, from ASLO Executive Director Teresa Curto, past ASLO President John Downing, and Founding Editor-in-Chief Pat Soranno. Second, we use the early L&O Letters story to highlight ingredients that appear essential for the successful launch of a new journal. Launching a new journal is a substantial effort and scientific publishing has a legacy of publications that failed because they did not fill a unique niche or void. Most new journals are Open Access and strive for rapid peer review, so they must offer something beyond these expected features and they must develop and succeed quickly to be self-sustaining. Without subscription revenue to help “seed,” fund, and sustain operating expenses, new journals must attract authors who are willing to invest in the article processing charges of open-access publication. Early success also requires authors to take a risk by submitting to a journal that has no Impact Factor for at least 3.5 yr and may never receive one. Established journals receive content at a healthy pace, but start-up journals have an uphill battle that requires significant effort to attract submissions. Like Kevin Costner's Field of Dreams, you build it and hope they (authors and readers) will come. “a platform for communication of the most innovative and trend-setting research in the aquatic sciences. Manuscripts should present high impact, cutting-edge results, discoveries or conceptual developments in any area of limnology and oceanography or its integration. Manuscripts will be selected based on their broad interest to the field; the strength of their empirical and conceptual foundations; their insightful, succinct and elegant conclusions; and their potential to advance knowledge in the aquatic sciences. Submissions must be short-format articles that are concise, highly focused analyses, with few display items.” Most scientific societies depend on publication revenue (Downing 2020), and library subscriptions to L&O were slipping in ca. 2010 when the publication environment became increasingly competitive (Downing 2013). As a step to ensure stability in finance and governance, the ASLO Board created an ad hoc committee to produce a forward-looking evaluation of ASLO's publications portfolio and operations. This committee recommended the hiring of an Executive Director (ED) to evaluate publication strategies and for ASLO to seek a commercial publishing partner to strengthen its market share of aquatic science publications. Teresa Curto accepted the ED position and began working with ASLO in February 2014. Meanwhile, following discussions with the ad hoc committee, I proposed three new journals to the Board of Directors, including L&O Letters, at the 2013 ASLO meeting. In my President's report, I wrote: “These could address empty market niches (such as) L&O Letters (LOL!) - Publishing fast-breaking, high-profile aquatic science” (These) “should be profit-making enterprises that charge competitive free-access charges to authors.” My proposal was roundly rebuffed as “competing with ourselves” in a limited market. Undaunted, I proposed these journals a second time in 2014, emphasizing the particular need for a Letters-type journal. With guidance from the new ED and committee members, the Board approved the launch of L&O Letters in August 2014. Also, in 2014, the ASLO Publications Committee (PC) interviewed several publishers to partner with to publish its portfolio, including the not-yet launched L&O Letters. Wiley, the selected partner, was enthusiastic about L&O Letters and made it part of their bid for the ASLO contract. The scope of L&O Letters was formulated by the PC and approved as described above. It is important that scientific societies avoid creating publications that compete with themselves. Prior to ratification of this scope, the PC Chair and I discussed it with the L&O Editor-in-Chief to ensure that it did not overlap with his and the Board's visions for the society's flagship journal. The PC's search for an L&O Letters Editor-in-Chief began in February 2015 and interviews took place in April. Pat Soranno was recommended enthusiastically by the PC because of her vision to create an author-centric journal that leverages the latest publishing technology and developments to create a new platform for communication among aquatic scientists. The first letters article was published in August 2016 (Saros et al. 2016). It should be noted that ASLO had previously attempted the creation of new publications: Limnology and Oceanography Fluids and Environments (2011–2014); Limnology and Oceanography eBooks (2010–2014); and Limnology and Oceanography eLectures (2009–2018). All were valiant attempts that required immense energy but were not sustainable. Some lessons from these experiences were that professional publication management (e.g., an Executive Director and a publishing partner) is a necessity for success, that new publication products need to fill large markets that are underserved by current offerings, and that authors need to be given sufficient confidence in the future of the product before entrusting their work. Upon reflection, 2014 was momentous for ASLO: we built a new governance structure, hired an Executive Director, engaged a professional publishing partner, consolidated our publications portfolio, enabled an expertise-driven PC, and founded a new publication. Julius Caesar, when fighting battles in several places and his armies were challenged on all sides, said that it is the usus (experience), the scientia (knowledge), and good foresight on the part of leadership that allows the creation of simultaneous solutions (Thorne 2007). L&O Letters' first Editor-in-Chief also faced the need to rise to simultaneous multiple challenges. When John Downing described the L&O Letters idea to me, I saw a rare opportunity to build a journal from the ground up, with a good chance of success given the strong relationship with Wiley, ASLO's publishing partner, and the need for the journal in the aquatic sciences. However, to see this vision through, we needed to build an editorial board from the ground up that would help to develop the culture and practices for the journal, who would serve as ambassadors for the journal to the many aquatic science research communities, and who would set the standards for rigor, impact, and quality that we were striving for. As the founding Editor-in-Chief, I am indebted to those scientists that agreed to join a fledgling journal to help shape and grow it. The journal could not exist without this superb group of individuals donating their time and energy to this effort, many of who are still serving, and one of which, Jim Cloern, who agreed to take the helm while I took leave and who is continuing to strengthen and build the journal. The early development of the journal was guided by two principles. The first is open science. However, not all aquatic scientists had fully embraced or had experience with open science practices such as data sharing. Therefore, an important early focus was to facilitate data sharing by providing authors resources to lower the barriers of adoption, such as detailed author guidelines for sharing data, an easy-to-use metadata template that ensures their data are well-described, and a short article describing the steps for sharing data (Soranno 2019). The second principle is related to the culture of science, particularly related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The scientific enterprise has much work ahead to create a culture that welcomes those who are marginalized or underrepresented, as well as those with less power, such as early-career researchers. These groups are typically not “at the table” making important decisions, and too often their members do not feel like they belong. Although I am not from a marginalized group, as a woman in science I have experienced the feelings of not belonging, of being an outsider or imposter, of not being listened to, and having anger directed at me for actions that, coming from a man in my position, would be applauded. I saw the position of Editor-in-Chief as an opportunity to think strategically about equity and inclusion throughout all decisions needed to build and run a journal. For example, I eliminated the “confidential comments to editors” box for reviewers as a step toward transparency in editorial decisions. I monitored reviewer comments so that inappropriate and personal attacks were not passed on to authors or considered in editorial decisions. I also sought exciting research from a wide range of scholars—early to late career, small to large research institutions, and across the globe. I hope this is an area where the journal can continue to grow and expand its impact. Finally, I developed a program to formally include early-career researchers in the publishing enterprise, the Raelyn Cole Editorial Fellowship (RCEF), which is supported from a fund established by a generous donation from the family of Raelyn Cole, Managing Editor of ASLO's flagship journal, Limnology and Oceanography, from 1965 to 1996. The RCEF was designed to give early-career researchers experiences in publishing and editing earlier rather than later in their careers and to provide them “a seat at the table” in high level discussions of the journal and publishing so that they could contribute their important perspective. In fact, the development of the RCEF was one of the more rewarding aspects of my time as Editor. Our first two cohorts of RCEF fellows have contributed to the journal and to ASLO in many important ways, including their articles about publishing that target early-career researchers and beyond (Falkenberg and Soranno 2017; Deemer et al. 2020; Hotaling 2020; Poulson-Ellestad et al. 2020), blog posts sharing their experiences, workshops on writing and publishing, contributions during joint ASLO-Wiley strategy meetings, and becoming valued collaborators and colleagues. I am particularly indebted to all our RCEF fellows because there was no model for editorial fellowships when we launched this program, and they were critical in its co-development. Laura Falkenberg deserves special mention as the first fellow who was willing to take on a new, minimally defined opportunity and not only run with it, but set an exceptionally high bar that all subsequent fellows have more than met! In thinking about how to sustain and grow a new journal after its successful launch, I think L&O Letters must not only focus on attracting and publishing the most impactful research written for scientists in all subfields in the aquatic sciences, but it must also continue to be author-centered, focused on inclusion, equity, and diversity, and always be at the cutting-edge of open science. Because we are amid major shifts in scientific publishing, and even science itself, L&O Letters will stay strong by adapting to the changing needs of all scientists. None declared. It should not be forgotten that the launch of a successful journal demands the volunteer dedication of many people. We therefore thank the many who made this possible. The 2008 strategic planning committee (Debbie Bronk, Paty Matrai, Carlos Duarte, & JAD) launched ASLO's guiding principles. The ACE Committee sought professional expertise to launch a forward-looking evaluation of ASLO's publications portfolio and overall operations (Paul del Giorgio, Debbie Bronk, Howard Browman, Lisa Campbell, JAD, and Paty Matrai). The executive director search committee (Karen Barch, JAD, Jim Elser, Wally Fulweiler, Pete Jumars, Roxane Maranger, and Helen Schneider) brought us the ED we needed to make this happen. The 2014 PC chaired by Paul del Giorgio searched for and recommended a new publishing partner. The 2015 PC (chaired by Wally Fulweiler with JAD, Mike Leonard, Miguel-Angel Mateo, Mike Pace) formulated the scope of L&O Letters, interviewed EiC candidates, and recommended Pat Soranno to the Board. The late Val H. Smith eloquently expressed his vision for a rejuvenated L&O thereby amplifying the Board's vision for L&O Letters. Joe Ackerman, Robin Anderson, and Jennifer Cherrier poured immense energy into promising publication ideas, helping the ASLO Board understand how much effort and production expertise new publications demand. Many others volunteered their time to serve on ASLO's Board at this time, playing critical roles in the evolution and vetting of ASLO's future, including: Lihini Aluwihare, Claudia Benitez-Nelson, Tom Bianchi, Amy Burgess, Jim Cotner, Alli Fong, Deidre Gibson, Paul Kemp, Peter Leavitt, Susanne Menden-Deuer, Liz Minor, Uta Passow, Gillian Stewart, Phil Taylor, Lars Tranvik, Anya Waite, Kim Wickland, Grace Wilkinson, and Michelle Wood. They should be recognized for their science leadership because this could not have happened without them. We owe a huge thanks to the founding editorial board of L&O Letters who played a major role in launching, implementing, and refining the journal vision through their editorial service and guidance to the journal Editor-in-Chief and ASLO: Mark Altabet, John Anderson, Meryem Beklioglu, Jill Baron, Claudia Benitez-Nelson, Alberto Borges, Kristen Buck, Carla Caceres, Kendra Cheruvelil, Jim Cloern, Jonathan Cole, Daniel Conley, Henrietta Dulai, Carlos Duarte, Rana El-Sabaawi, Peter Franks, Anna Gardmark, Patricia Glibert, Elise Granek, James Heffernan, Iris Hendriks, Dag Hessen, Jeffrey Krause, Peter Leavitt, Catherine Lovelock, Margaret Mulholland, Jordan Read, Jennifer Rehage, Barbara Robson, Michael Roman, Mark Scheuerell, Emily Stanley, Jennifer Tank, Lars Tranvik, Gesa Weyhenmeyer, Angelique White, and Monika Winder. Special thanks to Jim Cloern who has been Editor-in-Chief since August 2019 and who is continuing to push the journal in important directions. We also thank the Raelyn Cole Editorial Fellows Laura Falkenberg, Kelsey Poulson-Ellestad, Scott Hotaling, and Bridget Deemer who have contributed valuable ideas, perspective, and energy. We also thank Wiley as a valued and major contributing partner at all stages. We especially thank Hannah Smith in the early stages, and later Fiona Sarne who provided superb leadership, vision, and support to this emerging journal. Finally, a heartfelt thanks to those early authors who trusted us with their finest work. It has been an honor to work with you to get your work published and we are thrilled that you joined us on the journey to build the journal.

AB  - Results of a survey of the level of access provided to selected, free scholarly electronic journals by academic libraries is reported. A list of scholarly journals that are available electronically without any access limitations was compiled, and for each title the number of holding institutions on OCLC and its coverage by major abstracting and indexing services were determined. The twenty-five most popular titles, determined by number of holding institutions on OCLC, were searched on a random sample of library Web sites and catalogs to provide a separate gauge for access levels provided by institutions. Despite approximately half the titles being indexed by major vendors, including 88 percent of the top twenty-five, access levels were fairly low and decreased dramatically with size of the institution. The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society and Journal of Extension provide examples of free e-journals with print counterparts. Approximately one-half and one-third of the institutions, respectively, provide access to only the print versions of these journals (in the latter case, the print version is no longer produced, so access to current issues is not provided).

AB  - This study investigates the extent to which open access (OA) publishing models affect French researchers’ attitudes. Research questions were: What place does OA have in attitudes of French researchers in mathematics, biology, and computer science? Are French researchers aware of new publishing models? Do they publish in these new outlets? What funds do they use? What kind of feedback and satisfaction can we observe? We used a quantitative approach to identify structural trends. From April to May 2015, the authors gathered empirical data (interviews, training, and meetings) on researchers’ opinions and understanding of OA publishing models to define the variables and build up the questionnaire that was sent out in June 2015. The findings of the survey demonstrated that, when choosing journals to publish their articles, researchers did not rate OA as a criterion but rather impact, prestige, and symbolic recognition. Publishing OA articles is only in its first stages in the publishing practices of researchers. Lack of policy, prescriptions, and lack of rewards explain why OA is not a factor that determines the publishing strategies of French researchers. The researchers who take the risk of OA publishing are biologists, the older and more experienced researchers, and those who are members of editorial teams.

AB  - Abstract In the process of scientific research, many information objects are generated, all of which may remain valuable indefinitely. However, artifacts such as instrument data and associated calibration information may have little value in isolation; their meaning is derived from their relationships to each other. Individual artifacts are best represented as components of a life cycle that is specific to a scientific research domain or project. Current cataloging practices do not describe objects at a sufficient level of granularity nor do they offer the globally persistent identifiers necessary to discover and manage scholarly products with World Wide Web standards. The Open Archives Initiative's Object Reuse and Exchange data model (OAI‐ORE) meets these requirements. We demonstrate a conceptual implementation of OAI‐ORE to represent the scientific life cycles of embedded networked sensor applications in seismology and environmental sciences. By establishing relationships between publications, data, and contextual research information, we illustrate how to obtain a richer and more realistic view of scientific practices. That view can facilitate new forms of scientific research and learning. Our analysis is framed by studies of scientific practices in a large, multidisciplinary, multi‐university science and engineering research center, the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing.

AU  - Ecclestone, Meghan

C1  - Carleton University,
AB  - Academic libraries across North America are restructuring to meet user needs in an e-preferred environment, resulting in major changes to traditional collection development roles and workflows. Responsibility for collection work is increasingly assigned to functional librarians dedicated to collection development activities across a broad range of subject areas, often serving an entire faculty or college. This paper discusses the history, process, and outcomes of the transition to functional collection development roles at two mid-sized universities. Both Carleton University and the University of Guelph support a wide range of undergraduate and graduate research needs from a single central library, but have implemented a different type of organizational design and are at different stages in the restructuring process. One year into their new functional roles, Carleton’s librarians are preparing to assess the state of change around collection development in their organization, and identify next steps for the restructuring process. By contrast, the University of Guelph has worked with a functional team model for ten years, and is undertaking a 10-year review to assess whether the original goals of the reorganization were met. How does collections work compare under a functional team model, compared to a traditional liaison model? Both perspectives offer strategies for consultation and change management that may be helpful to other institutions restructuring their collection development activities.

AU  - Allen, Nicole

AB  - Academic libraries have always thought of “content” as their domain on campus. Yet beyond the course reserve desk, libraries have traditionally played a relatively small role on campus for the most common form of content in higher education, textbooks. Today, everything about textbooks and other course content is changing quickly. Spiraling costs have made textbooks a political issue in some states, while at the same time traditional textbook publishers experience economic pressures both from the growth of the used and rental markets and from new technological demands from the professors who assign their online books as well as from the students who use them. Librarians have begun to take notice, reversing course on the traditional library view of textbooks. A number of libraries are looking for more affordable ways for students to access textbooks. Many are leveraging open educational resources (OER) as alternatives to expensive, commercially-published textbooks. Other libraries have themselves become textbook publishers. This changed course has led librarians sometimes into new alliances and sometimes into degrees of conflict with other organizations, such as bookstores, commercial publishers, university presses, and aggregators.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the initial transformation of one academic library's digital media library into the institutional repository (IR) of its entire academic organization. Design/methodology/approach Provides a description of an academic digital library's evolution into an institutional repository, accompanied by both practical and philosophical analyses. Findings Materials supporting an academic institution's scholarship (from colleges and from supporting organizations on campus) can play an important part in the success of an institutional repository. Standards for metadata content, data structures and hierarchies of collections must be followed consistently, and adequate storage for digital media within an institutional repository is necessary to have in advance of anticipated demand for the smooth operation of the IR and continued access to materials. Gray areas between the role of an institutional repository and the role of that organization's archives need to be addressed in the future. Practical implications Academic libraries can be highly successful in producing an institute repository by developing relationships with various organizations on campus in addition to the academic programs. Maintaining standards throughout the IR is crucial to future growth in an organized and consistent manner. Philosophical considerations of the role of the IR should be addressed in the beginning stages of the development of the IR for eliminating confusion and duplication of its contents with other campus organizations. Originality/value This paper describes the development of a digital library, created and maintained by an academic library, and its gradual change into a de facto institutional repository. Other libraries in the planning stages or initial steps of creating a campus‐wide digital library or an institutional repository can benefit from the description of possible successes and problems that they could encounter during implementation.

AB  - The discussion on the transformation of scholarly journals to open access (OA) increasingly concerns financial aspects. Considering the variety of funding strategies for article processing charge (APCs), the array of cost types for scientific information and the need for data monitoring to promote cost transparency, an integrated view of the financial dimension of the OA transition is needed. This commentary describes the need for implementing an information budget that looks beyond just the library budget and comprehensively targets all financial flows from universities and other research performing organizations to publishers. An information budget promotes an integrated perspective on the distributed costs at a given institution. This centralized approach of assessing financial flows can be used to strengthen the position of research institutions when negotiating with publishers.

AB  - Watch VIDEO. Scholarly publishers in small language countries face unique challenges, such as limited funding and resources, lack of visibility and recognition, and the dominance of international commercial publishers in the global academic publishing market. Therefore, understanding the role of publishers in promoting scholarly research in small language countries is crucial. This research aims to evaluate the publication of scholarly journals in a small language country (Lithuania) by analyzing the owners and publishers of scholarly journals. After collecting information about all scholarly journals published in 2020, a list of publishers and owners was compiled. The results show that since 1990, the publishing of Lithuanian scholarly journals has grown significantly: 225 scholarly journals were published in Lithuania, by 73 different publishers, in 2020. Social publishers, mostly state-funded universities, scientific institutes, colleges, still had the largest market share of scholarly periodicals, but commercial publishers also appeared and started to make a business out of publishing scholarly journals. Judging by the number of published articles, the five largest Lithuanian social publishers – state universities – published almost half of all scholarly articles published by Lithuanian publishers. Journals of social science were published the most, and one in five journals published in Lithuania applied relatively small publication fees. The analyzed data on publishers show that Lithuanian publishers have tried to take over and reorganize a number of scholarly journals from the Soviet era, while adapting to the dynamically changing world of scholarly publishing, and moving from simple product-sales models of the 20th century to new digital ecosystems of the 21st century, in which the essential distribution of publications is carried out digitally. The emerging diversity of publishers, the relatively moderate application of publication fees, and the growth in the number of articles show that Lithuanian publishers are quite well prepared for further challenges – the implementation of the European Science Foundation Plan S recommendations.

AB  - Summary Primary and secondary publishers have traditionally defined their role within the scientific communication process in terms of a model in which information flows in a neat, linear way from author/inventor to primary publisher to secondary publisher and back-either directly or through other intermediators and expediters-to me authors and inventors who need the information to support their own research. This “production orientation” model-closely tied to print technology, even though some of its forms are now electronic-continues to function. But these “channels” are increasingly being augmented by electronic alternatives that often defy definition under the production chain model. This paper will share the observations and thoughts of secondary publishers and information providers on trends, focusing on threats and opportunities for scholarly communication.

AB  - During the last years the call for publishing and sharing research data has become ubiquitous. Besides moral appeals towards transparency as a basic principle of science, more and more policies and regulations start to push researchers to make their research data available to the scientific community and the general public. In addition to research funding organizations, publishers are most influential in this regard as they are able to boost the practice of data sharing by incentives that are highly attractive for researchers: publications and hence reputation in academia. In consequence more and more datasets are published by researchers – in very different ways, using the quite heterogeneous tools and publishing solutions currently available.However, these data publications do not necessarily increase transparency in research. Publishing research data might even contribute to an increase in noise and opacity. Mere disclosure of date has very little value per se, as The Royal Society in its report “Science as an open enterprise” (2012) noticed. The report asks for “intelligent openness” where data are not just published but effectively communicated. To accomplish intelligent openness, data have to be accessible, intelligible, assessable and usable (p. 14).The presentation will take up this consideration and explore the challenges involved. Communicating data aims at enabling receivers (i. e. data users) to correctly interpret and appropriately use the published research data. As will be shown by examples of published datasets from the field of behavioral and social sciences, currently this aim is by no means generally achieved. In seeking to comply with data policies of funders and publishers researcher may be inclined to publish datasets that are hardly intelligible and not usable. Additionally there is a lack of data publishing infrastructures (including technical tools as well as standards and social practices) supporting researchers in communicating data in a meaningful way to their different audiences. Obviously, it is much easier to share data within the own research community than across research fields, disciplines or even cultures. In general, the less the researchers who publish data and the audience who wants to use these data share a common context (increasing “distance-from-data-origin”, Baker &amp; Yarmey 2009), the more demanding communicating research data will become.Thus, publishers face considerable challenges when trying to advance from publishing to communicating research data. Developing solutions pointing in this direction should be, nevertheless, of primary concern, as publishing without communicating might ultimately be just a waste of resources. Therefore, besides exploring the challenges, the presentation will also try to identify steps that might help to approach the ambitious goal of communicating research data.

AB  - In recent years, library users have shifted from searching in library catalogs and scholarly databases to searching in library discovery systems. This shift has introduced a fundamental change in the information-seeking process. Discovery systems provide access to a large, diverse information landscape of scholarly materials regardless of where the materials are located, what format they are in, and whether the library owns them or subscribes to them. At the same time, these systems typically offer simple, Google-like searching as the default option, to accommodate the expectations of today’s users. With this type of searching, users do not spend much time formulating queries, and their queries often yield large result sets; therefore, discovery systems focus on relevance ranking and on tools that help users easily navigate and refine result sets. Librarians have welcomed the advances in discovery services for their users. However, this new reality poses challenges to the practices that librarians have developed over the years and, in some cases, is at odds with the systematic, controlled approach to searching endorsed by librarians. Examinations of information-seeking and information-searching models together with a review of new technological capabilities of library discovery systems show why such systems help today’s searchers and facilitate their research more than the traditional systems.

AB  - Several libraries have become active partners in Open Access publishing of books in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Not only have libraries started up their own presses, they are also collaborating with existing presses or forming alliances with other institutions on campus such as scholarly communication offices, ICT departments, and academic research centers. By combining institutional strengths and enabling the sharing of resources across institutions, these collaborations offer synergies and efficiencies in the scholarly book publishing business. This paper examines this new function taken on by libraries. Using research conducted by the European project "Open Access Publishing in European Networks" (OAPEN) on OA publishing models and business models for books, we look at libraries' motives and challenges and explore how their new roles enable them to serve their customers in the most effective way. By combining digital repositories with scholarly publishing, libraries can facilitate and support HSS book publishing and can help sustain the scholarly monograph in the transition towards digital formats and an Open Access future.

AB  - As an industry, scholarly publishing attracts more women than men. Yet despite their majority, there is a concerning dearth of women in the industry's most senior positions. Furthermore, and we will posit, contributing to this leadership divide, there is a significant gender gap in speaking opportunities at major industry conferences. In this paper, we will present the research that supports these claims and offer three distinct challenges – to publishing organizations; to the women that work for them; and to the community at large – to help address this imbalance and improve gender parity, both at the podium and in the boardroom. In 2014, preparing for a Society for Scholarly Publishing (SSP) panel entitled ‘Mind the Gap—Addressing the Need for More Women Leaders in Scholarly Publishing’, we analysed the then-current SSP roster of 956 individual members. This list revealed a ratio of 58%/42% women to men. Digital Science's recent demographic survey of 828 individuals across 33 countries corroborated this majority, reporting a ratio of 63%/37% women to men (Wheeler, 2015). This likely does not come as a surprise for anyone who has worked for a major scholarly publisher or attended an industry conference. However, it presents an important baseline for this paper's recommendations: parity based on demographics, not on special treatment. In our 2014 analysis, we examined 68 of SSP's organizational members, finding that at that time, only 24% had a female CEO or equivalent, and just 17% (of a partial list of 54 with data publicly available) had a female chairperson or equivalent. For this paper, we expanded our research to a list of 186 ALPSP organizational members. The ALPSP membership was selected as being representative of a wider swathe of scholarly publishers of different size, revenue, region, and market focus. Note that the list, when accessed in October 2015, included 253 organizational members. For this analysis, we excluded individual consultancies, journals, and those for which leadership data was not publicly available. Of these 186 organizations, 32% had a female CEO, and 21% (of a partial list of 168 with data publicly available) had a female chairperson. These results are summarized in Fig. 1. Even equipped with these compelling data, we have found this disparity to be difficult for many to swallow. In the wake of our ‘Mind the Gap’ session and subsequent discussions, many commenters – male and female – were quick to point out notable examples of female leadership in scholarly publishing. Indeed, we the authors both come from organizations (BioOne and ORCID, respectively) with female CEOs. Yet, until the percentage of women in senior leadership roles rises closer to the percentage of women in the industry, our focus needs to be on the rule rather than the exceptions, as notable and impressive as they may be. As with many industries, scholarly publishing has a rich tradition of annual meetings and conferences, often bringing together professionals from around the globe. Participation in these events is critical for professional development, and the chance to speak – especially as a keynote speaker – is highly desirable. CVs commonly carry a ‘presentations’ section, and job postings for senior positions frequently cite a history of speaking engagements and conference participation as key desiderata. Clearly, in scholarly publishing as in other industries, there is a link between professional progress, especially to the industry's most senior positions, and the visibility and caché afforded by public-speaking opportunities. We analysed seven major scholarly publishing conferences held in 2015, looking at speaker gender as well as keynote assignment and single-gender panels (summarized in Figs. 2 and 3). Conferences included in the analysis were: Academic Publishing in Europe (APE); Professional & Scholarly Publishing (PSP); Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA); Association of Learned Professional and Society Publishers (ALPSP); International Association of Science, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM); Society for Scholarly Publishing (SSP); and Association of American University Presses (AAUP). Of these seven, only one conference fell in line with industry demographics; of AAUP's 142 speakers, 83 were women (58%). SSP also demonstrated a female majority, with 55% women speakers. The other five organizations ranged from 45% down to 17% women speakers, with APE having the lowest percentage. On average, the seven conferences demonstrated a 63% men to 37% women split. Thus, while there is evidence of some diversification efforts, on average, scholarly publishing conferences are under-representing women on their speaker rosters by nearly 20%. Keynote addresses (applied only to those explicitly labelled as such for the purposes of this exercise) represent the largest inequity. Three conferences examined featured only male keynotes, three had keynotes from both men and women, and one had no keynote address. Overall, there were nearly twice as many male to female keynotes (11 by men and six by women out of a pool of 17). Lastly, we examined the prevalent trending hashtag, #allmalepanels, used on social media to highlight panels featuring only male speakers. Our analysis of these seven conferences yielded 15 instances of all-male panels. Interestingly, all but AAUP had at least one all-male panel. Only SSP and AAUP featured the reverse – six and five all-female panels, respectively. If we, as an industry, believe that conference participation is critical to professional development and access to senior leadership positions, then we must create a system that corrects for the significant gender gap in speaking opportunities. Gender disparity does not happen by accident. Mathematician Greg Martin of the University of British Columbia recently made headlines by proving that it was statistically impossible for a speakers’ lineup at a mathematics conference to include only one woman among 20 – even with a conservative 24% female industry representation (Martin, 2015). Extending this to scholarly publishing, with its 58% female majority, we can safely say that a confluence of male keynotes, all-male panels, and overall female-speaking minorities are not accidental results. However, they are likely also not intentional. Instead, they are the result of a system of unacknowledged biases and the tendency to invite individuals to speak who are visible, vocal, and have presented before. In short, gender disparity – and a lack of diversity more generally – is self-perpetuating. I think there is an awareness about ensuring women are represented because so many women work in the scholarly publishing industry. These same women are proposing, organizing, and selecting panelists for sessions. In fact, women have exclusively served as co-chairs for the committee since 2012. In a past year when there was not a woman in the keynote/plenary line-up, our attendees took notice and called it out specifically on the post-event evaluation and via social media. Because we want to be sure we are creating a programme that is appealing to our members and attendees, we take notice and try to be vigilant about ensuring diversity within the programme. In other words, correcting gender disparity – especially during a time of transition – requires forethought and action. SSP's programme committee was committed to gender balance; they sought out (according to their call for proposals,) ‘a variety of viewpoints from a diverse pool of speakers’, and they actively selected sessions and speakers that reflected this diversity. The result was not just a high-quality programme but a speaker lineup that was broadly representative of our industry's demographics. As an industry, scholarly publishing employs more women than men, but fails to reflect this fact among its most senior leaders. A strong, sustainable industry is one that invests in its people and that rewards strong performers irrespective of gender or any other demographic. In closing, we hope that our fellow publishing colleagues will accept our challenges – at the personal, organizational, and industry-wide levels – in order to ensure that scholarly publishing will be able to attract and retain the talented professionals of today and tomorrow. An important note on the authors' methodology: collected data are the result of manual analysis of online conference programs and membership lists and not official or externally validated counts provided by the respective organizations analysed. As such, a small degree of error may be present (e.g., due to misinterpretation of a speaker's gender). However, we believe the margin of error to be minimal and unlikely to significantly affect the results presented.

AB  - Open infrastructure is foundational to the conduct of open research, and repositories are a key component of open research infrastructure, providing an avenue for the open dissemination of research outputs. Repositories also play a crucial role in increasing equity of access and supporting compliance with funder policies for open access. The U.S. Repository Network (USRN) seeks to support the nation’s open research repositories in cementing their position as an essential component of our national research infrastructure. In summer 2021, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) announced its partnership with the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) to catalyze a US repository network and its intention to hire a visiting program officer to lead that work. I was lucky enough to secure that role and began work in September 2021.

AB  - Key points Our collective authorship and publishing practices do not always end up ensuring that scholarly content is discoverable by readers. Readers of all kinds rely on a variety of ‘discovery pathways’, such as search engines, library systems, and various electronic links, some of which are blind to the content they desire. Efforts over the years to improve content discoverability have made great progress, but an increasing amount of freely available content brings up new issues. The National Information Standards Organization (NISO)’s Discovery to Delivery (D2D) Topic Committee has developed a grid comparing various ways in which content is shared with various ways in which users discover such content. This article brings to light a few of the current obstacles and opportunities for innovation by publishers, aggregators, search engines, and library systems, and invites Learned Publishing readers to step up and identify others.

AB  - Digitization and the rise of Open Access publishing is an important recent development in academic communication. The current publishing system exhibits challenges with cost, where many universities are forced to cancel journal subscriptions for economic reasons, as well as access, as scholars and the public alike often lack access to research published in paywalled subscription journals. Open Access publishing solves the access problem, but not necessarily cost problems. Universities and researchers are currently in a challenging, interstitial stage of scholarly publishing. Subscription journals still dominate scholarly communication, yet a growing imperative to fund and support Open Access alternatives also exists. Stakeholders, including faculty, university administrators, publishers, scientific funding institutions and librarians and governments alike currently strategize and fight for their professional and economic interests in the broader publishing system. Four main trends are suggested that will characterize the future of scholarly publishing: 1) antagonism with scholarly associations; 2) changes and innovations to peer review; 3) Scientific/Intellectual Movements around Open Access 4) publishing and new professional niches in the publishing landscape. This article suggests potential trajectories and outcomes for these various conflicts over the costs and benefits of academic publishing.

AB  - The academic publication takes on an increasingly relevant place to shape, on the one hand, the scholar’s prestige, and on the other, the prestige of the institution to which he or she is attached. In addition, academic publishing is vital for the development of scientific knowledge and the contribution to the community. This paper analyzes several dimensions that may be central to academic publishing in the near future. To this end, in methodological terms, a qualitative approach was favored, namely through the documentary analysis of scientific writings that analyze this topic. The results of this analysis reveal that this is a process in constant and accelerated development, but there will have to be criteria and processes for selecting what is scientifically relevant from what is called “noise” in scientific publishing. Increasing quality will have to be a fundamental element in this process.

AB  - The future of scholarly publishing, in particular the growth of Open Access publishing and how it is financially sustained, is hotly debated. Many different models, advantages, and disadvantages are being discussed. Yet, there is little consensus about what a future system should look like or how it should be governed. To describe the ongoing dynamics in scholarly publishing, this paper introduces the multilevel perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP). This explorative application of the MLP addresses five possible transition pathways: transformation, reconfiguration, substitution, de-alignment &amp; re-alignment, or a sequence. The analysis shows that incumbents survive by adapting to niche innovations and withstanding landscape pressure by innovating themselves, in terms of technology, business models and through acquisitions. In other words, the current trajectory reproduces the oligopoly of incumbents. This means that the sector is, at minimum, on a trajectory of transformation or, potentially, reconfiguration. This diagnosis may change when the dynamics change, for instance if niche innovations and landscape pressure converged stronger on an alternative pathway.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, the research of statistical methods to analyze complex structures of data has increased. In particular, a lot of attention has been focused on the interval-valued data. In a classical cluster analysis framework, an interesting line of research has focused on the clustering of interval-valued data based on fuzzy approaches. Following the partitioning around medoids fuzzy approach research line, a new fuzzy clustering model for interval-valued data is suggested. In particular, we propose a new model based on the use of the entropy as a regularization function in the fuzzy clustering criterion. The model uses a robust weighted dissimilarity measure to smooth noisy data and weigh the center and radius components of the interval-valued data, respectively. To show the good performances of the proposed clustering model, we provide a simulation study and an application to the clustering of scientific journals in research evaluation.

AB  - Though women outnumber men at a ratio of approximately 4:1 in the library and information science (LIS) field as a whole and 3:1 in academic librarianship, past studies suggest that maleauthored LIS print journal articles outnumber female-authored articles both in number and in citations received.The amount of citations received can serve as an indication of status within the LIS profession and can affect chances for professional advancement.This study uses citation analysis to measure patterns of gender, authorship and citation within the LIS e-journals LIBRES and Information Research, and compares these results to Håkanson's (2005) citation analysis of gender and citation patterns in three core LIS print journals.Results of this study suggest gendered affinity in citation and reference behavior.Findings include that from 1995-2007 more men than women published articles in LIBRES and Information Research; that both men and women referenced more male-authored articles; that men referenced male-authored articles at a greater rate than women referenced female-authored articles; that articles by women received more citations overall; and that men cited articles by men at a greater rate than they cited articles by women.Though female authorship was proportionately higher in the two LIS e-journals than in the three core LIS print journals, the imbalance in citation and reference patterns suggests that gender influences both male and female authors' choice of references, as well as the amount of citations that authors receive.

AB  - Peer review of scientific manuscripts before publication is essential in scholarly publishing, and most active researchers hold relationships with a number of journals as both an author and a reviewer. There have been several studies focusing on gender balance in academic research and authorship, but fewer studies on our role as reviewers. Publons is a commercial website run by Clarivate Analytics that allows researchers to track and verify their peer review activities and be recognized for it. The platform features over 2 million researchers and 6.9 million reviews for more than 5,000 partnered journals, listing the most active reviewers as “top reviewers”. Our study focuses on gender representation in this ‘top reviewer’ group while also looking at the countries, regions and research fields they represent, as well as the relationship between their roles as authors and reviewers. The results show that male reviewers dominate in almost all countries, regions, and research fields. Male reviewers generally contribute to review work more frequently than females; however, female reviewers write longer reviews. The correlations between reviewing activity and research activity are generally weak overall and within specific research fields. This may reflect that active reviewers are not necessarily the most productive researchers in their fields. What clearly emerges from our results is the need for more concern over gender representation in the quality assurance and gatekeeping functions of scholarly publishing.

AB  - The loss of talented women from senior academic positions has partly resulted from a lower number of published papers and the accompanying reduced visibility of female compared to male scientists. The reasons for these gender-differences in authorship is unclear. One potential reason is a bias in the editorial and review process of scientific journals. We investigated whether patterns of authorship and editorial outcome were biased according to gender and geographic location in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology. Such potential bias may contribute to inequality in the field. We found patterns of gender differences in authorship, but this was unrelated to the editorial decision of whether to publish the manuscript. Female first-authors (the lead role) were six times less likely to be named as the corresponding author than male first-authors, and female first-authors were more likely to be displaced as corresponding authors by female co-authors than were male first-authors. We found an under-representation of female first- and last-authors compared to baseline populations of members of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (which publishes the Journal of Evolutionary Biology) and of Evolutionary Biology faculty at the world top-10 universities for the Life Sciences. Also, manuscripts from Asia were five times more likely to be rejected on the final decision, independent of gender. Overall our results suggest that the peer review processes we investigated at the Journal of Evolutionary Biology are predominately gender-neutral, but not neutral to geographic location. Editorial gender-bias is thus unlikely to be a contributing factor to differences in authorship in this journal.

AB  - Summary There is a widespread perception in the academic community that peer review is subject to many biases and can be influenced by the identity and biographic features (such as gender) of manuscript authors. We examined how patterns of authorship differ between men and women, and whether author gender influences editorial and peer review outcomes and/or the peer review process for papers submitted to the journal Functional Ecology between 2010 and 2014. Women represented approximately a third of all authors on papers submitted to Functional Ecology . Relative to overall frequency of authorship, women were underrepresented as solo authors (26% were women). On multi‐authored papers, women were also underrepresented as last/senior authors (25% were women) but overrepresented as first authors (43% were women). Women first authors were less likely than men first authors to serve as corresponding and submitting author of their papers; this difference was not influenced by the gender of the last author. Women were more likely to be authors on papers if the last author was female. Papers with female authors (i) were equally likely to be sent for peer review, (ii) obtained equivalent peer review scores and (iii) were equally likely to be accepted for publication, compared to papers with male authors. There was no evidence that male editors or male reviewers treated papers authored by women differently than did female editors and reviewers, and no evidence that more senior editors reached different decisions than younger editors after review, or cumulative through the entire process, for papers authored by men vs. women. Papers authored by women were more likely to be reviewed by women. This is primarily because women were more likely to be invited to review if the authors on a paper were female than if the authors were male. Patterns of authorship, and the role undertaken as author (e.g., submitting and serving as corresponding author), differ notably between men and women for papers submitted to Functional Ecology . However, consistent with a growing body of literature indicating that peer review underlying the scholarly publishing process is largely gender‐neutral, outcomes of editorial and peer review at Functional Ecology were not influenced by author gender.

AB  - The productivity and performance of men is generally rated more highly than that of women in controlled experiments, suggesting conscious or unconscious gender biases in assessment. The degree to which editors and reviewers of scholarly journals exhibit gender biases that influence outcomes of the peer-review process remains uncertain due to substantial variation among studies. We test whether gender predicts the outcomes of editorial and peer review for >23,000 research manuscripts submitted to six journals in ecology and evolution from 2010 to 2015. Papers with female and male first authors were equally likely to be sent for peer review. However, papers with female first authors obtained, on average, slightly worse peer-review scores and were more likely to be rejected after peer review, though the difference varied among journals. These gender differences appear to be partly due to differences in authorial roles. Papers for the which the first author deferred corresponding authorship to a coauthor (which women do more often than men) obtained significantly worse peer-review scores and were less likely to get positive editorial decisions. Gender differences in corresponding authorship explained some of the gender differences in peer-review scores and positive editorial decisions. In contrast to these observations on submitted manuscripts, gender differences in peer-review outcomes were observed in a survey of >12,000 published manuscripts; women reported similar rates of rejection (from a prior journal) before eventual publication. After publication, papers with female authors were cited less often than those with male authors, though the differences are very small (~2%). Our data do not allow us to test hypotheses about mechanisms underlying the gender discrepancies we observed, but strongly support the conclusion that papers authored by women have lower acceptance rates and are less well cited than are papers authored by men in ecology.

AB  - Abstract Despite substantial progress for women in science, women remain underrepresented in many aspects of the scholarly publication process. We examined how the gender diversity of editors and reviewers changed over time for six journals in ecology and evolution (2003–2015 for four journals, 2007–2015 or 2009–2015 for the other two), and how several aspects of the peer review process differed between female and male editors and reviewers. We found that for five of the six journals, women were either absent or very poorly represented as handling editors at the beginning of our dataset. The representation of women increased gradually and consistently, with women making up 29% of the handling editors (averaged across journals) in 2015, similar to the representation of women as last authors on ecology papers (23% in 2015) but lower than the proportion of women among all authors (31%) and among members of the societies that own the journals (37%–40%). The proportion of women among reviewers has also gradually but consistently increased over time, reaching 27% by 2015. Female editors invited more female reviewers than did male editors, and this difference increased with age of the editor. Men and women who were invited to review did not differ in whether they responded to the review invitation, but, of those that responded, women were slightly more likely to agree to review. In contrast, women were less likely than men to accept invitations to serve on journal editorial boards. Our analyses indicate that there has been progress in the representation of women as reviewers and editors in ecology and evolutionary biology, but women are still underrepresented among the gatekeepers of scholarly publishing relative to their representation among researchers.

AB  - Abstract In this editorial essay, we argue that Generative Artificial Intelligence programs (GenAI) draw on what we term a “hypercommons”, involving collectively produced inputs and labour that are largely invisible or untraceable. We argue that automatizing the exploitation of common inputs, in ways that remix and reconfigure them, can lead to a crisis of academic authorship in which the moral agency involved in scholarly production is increasingly eroded. We discuss the relationship between the hypercommons and authorship in terms of moral agency and the ethics of academic production, speculating on different responses to the crisis of authorship as posed by GenAI.

AB  - This study of UCL Press sought to identify the extent to which data available to open access (OA) monograph presses can be combined with low‐cost analysis tools to provide insight into development and strategy. An additional goal was identifying practical steps that monograph publishers can take to ensure that they make the most of the data they have access to. The project team carried out an analysis of downloaded figures from platforms providing access to UCL Press monograph titles, social media activity, and sales patterns. Patterns of engagement with the books were cross‐referenced against key marketing and dissemination events in order to identify relationships between marketing approaches and awareness or use of a title. This study shows that it is possible to gain valuable insights into the uses of OA books by collating and analysing usage and social media data. It also identifies a series of relatively straightforward steps that can be taken by presses to maximize the richness of the data captured. These include proactively gathering and storing data; providing best practice advice to those engaging in promotion, particularly when promotion is via social media; and making it easier to track specific efforts to publicize books by using tagged links.

AB  - Ghost authorship, whereby someone who has made a major contribution to a scientific article as an author is not acknowledged, is a widespread practice, says a study published this week. In the clinical trials investigated in the study, three quarters of individuals who had made significant contributions to the final paper were not listed as authors ( PLoS Medicine 2007;4:e19). In most cases these were statisticians working for the company sponsoring the trial. “Ghost authorship is a form of research misappropriation, and we believe that this practice serves commercial purposes,” said the study's lead author, Peter Gotzsche, of the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen. “Authorship establishes accountability, responsibility, …

AB  - Abstract The creation of publishing conglomerates and the emergence of purchasing consortia are changing the economic model of scholarly publishing and the process of individual collection management. But will the giants fundamentally change the serials community? Despite the undoubted impact of consolidation, the needs of authors and readers will predominate, and the place of quality control and peer review, though under challenge, will be central to formal scholarly communication. Nevertheless, both publishers and librarians will have to change their traditional cultures and processes, and work in collegial alliances. Size and dominance will be factors impacting the serials community. This paper surveys the likely impact of the giants on the serials community in the next decade: alliances between publishers and other information providers, the continuing importance of quality control and peer review, and the needs of authors and readers. Some informed speculation will challenge the complacency and conservatism of many in the serials community.

AB  - This brief research report analyzes the availability of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) worldwide, highlighting the dominance of large publishing houses and the need for unique persistent identifiers to increase the visibility of publications from developing countries. The study reveals that a considerable amount of publications from developing countries are excluded from the global flow of scientific information due to the absence of DOIs, emphasizing the need for alternative publishing models. The authors suggest that the availability of DOIs should receive more attention in scholarly communication and scientometrics, contributing to a necessary debate on DOIs relevant for librarians, publishers, and scientometricians.

AB  - Not since the age of Gutenberg has an information upheaval so thoroughly disrupted the processes of scholarly knowledge creation, management and preservation as the digital revolution currently under way. Academic libraries have traditionally been structured to effectively facilitate the access, use and storage of mostly static, print-based research collections. In the midst of sweeping change university libraries are attempting to re-imagine services, embrace emerging technologies, reallocate resources and provide proactive leadership in a new digital knowledge society. This article provides both historical perspective and a forward-looking examination into how academic libraries are transforming themselves to both cope with, and help shape, unprecedented transitions in scholarly research and communication.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the attitudes and actions of scientific journal editors in China towards open access. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 Chinese editors from various scientific journals during September and October of 2022. The results indicate that the editors generally possess knowledge of open access and have implemented an appropriate open access model for their respective journals. However, the Chinese-language journal editors expressed a lack of motivation to adopt open access, unless there is a reform in the mechanism of academic publishing or a policy is imposed. On the other hand, the English-language journal editors acknowledged that they have no other choice but to adopt open access. This study helps us learn about Chinese editors’ understanding and attitudes towards open access, the current status of open access in China’s scientific journals, and the mechanisms of academic publishing in China.

Learn more.Copy URL Share a linkShare onFacebookTwitterLinkedInRedditWechat Abstract Key points The debate about open access has until now focused on the gold (journals) versus the green route (manuscript self-archival). Recently an even more disruptive form of OA has emerged, in the form of illegal article copies retrievable from academic social networks or pirate sites. Illegal, or “black open access”, provides access to a large part of the pay-walled article output which cannot be found in repositories. INTRODUCTION Universal open access (OA) to scholarly research publications is deceptively simple as a concept. Any scientific publications, whether found via a Google keyword search, or by trying to access a citation would be just one click away. But the path to get there from the current subscription-dominated journal publishing model has proved to be complex and filled with obstacles. Since the terms gold and green OA were coined almost 15 years ago, much of the debate inside the OA movement has been focused on the relative merits of these two paths (Harnad et al., 2004). Currently gold OA seems to be growing in importance. There are a number of factors contributing to this. First is the emergence of successful professional OA publishers and megajournals offering rapid publication via an innovative peer review approach. The second coming from hybrid OA publication, is also of increasing impact, fuelled by the new APC funding mechanisms put in place by major research funders like the Wellcome Trust and the Research Councils UK. New kinds of nationwide super-bundle licences that cover both subscription access and hybrid charges, could further establish hybrid as a conversion vehicle to full OA (Björk, 2016). Traditional green OA in institutional repositories has been struggling with getting researchers to upload, despite the fact that most major universities now have such repositories in place (Eisen, 2015). The researchers just do not seem to bother with the little extra work involved and many are ignorant of the possibilities. The leading subject repositories, arXiv and PMC are doing better, but only cover some fields of science. And publishers have tightened embargo rules for self-archiving, making green OA less attractive. All in all, the progress towards full OA has been slower than hoped for. Currently somewhere between 35 and 50% of all research articles from recent years can be found as either gold, hybrid, or self-archived repository copies. Empirical studies have shown varying shares depending on the definitions and methods employed (Archambault et al., 2013; Björk, Laakso, Welling, & Paetau, 2014; Research Information Network, 2015). A recent development muddling the picture is the emergence of other channels for uploading and accessing research articles without subscriptions, payments, and bureaucracy. In contrast to proper repositories which by and large enforce the licence rules, these new channels mostly offer the exact digital replicas of the published journal articles, and do so illegally. The two main players are academic social media, especially Research Gate, and pirate copy websites such as Sci-Hub. I propose to call this black OA. Black as in the classical pirate flag, or in black market! I was first considering the milder colour grey, but the term grey literature has already an established meaning in the context of scholarly publishing covering theses, government reports, and the rest (Schöpfel, 2011). Grey literature has in fact greatly benefitted from OA. Other terms which have been suggested are ‘rogue’ OA or ‘Robin Hood’ OA (Archambault, 2014), but my preference is for a simple tricolour scheme. In terms of colour coding of flavours of OA the term platinum OA (Haschak, 2007) has also been proposed for non-APC-charging gold OA (free also for authors), but the term has never really caught on. ACADEMIC SOCIAL NETWORKS Academic Social Networks (ASNs, i.e. Research Gate, Mendeley, Academia.edu) have their origin in the tremendous success of networks like Facebook and LinkedIn. Like all such networks, the key factor is critical mass. If enough colleagues of yours have already joined, the incentive increases. Some ASNs also have a dubious practice of spamming non-members with emails seemingly coming from colleagues, which actually are sent automatically by the systems. ASNs also try to offer other features like citation counts of their own, user profiles, and so on (Nicholas, Clark, & Herman, 2016). The leading ASNs are all business ventures where the revenue model, because they do not charge members, is to build up a big enough user base to exit via being bought by a bigger company (Matthews, 2016). The prime case is Mendeley, which was purchased by Elsevier in 2013. Elsevier also bought the much older SSRN (Social Sciences Research Network) in 2016. Although most articles uploaded to ASNs are direct portable document format (PDF) copies of the published articles, it is perfectly possible to upload personal versions of the manuscripts. But even this might not be in accordance with many licence agreements that authors have signed with publishers. So far massive lawsuits against ASNs have not started, but for instance Elsevier has sent out takedown requests to Academia.edu (Howard, 2013). PIRATE COPY SITES The role model for sites of pirate copies of scholarly journal articles is Napster. Here the driving force is not financial gain but indignation that a few big publishers are making big profits ‘off the back’ of the global academic community. The notion that the results of research is a public good which should be free is common with advocates of gold and green OA, but the approach is more radical in actually breaking the law. To date Sci-Hub is the notable example, although there have been earlier incidents of massive downloading of scholarly articles by OA activists (Murphy, 2011). Another related way of obtaining article copies is to twitter messages including an article title (i.e. #icanhazPDF) asking unknown academics who have subscription access to download a copy and mail it to the tweeter (Gardner & Gardner, 2015). As blatantly illegal as Sci-Hub for instance is, it has been difficult for the publishers to take legal action. What they have achieved so far is that Sci-Hub has been forced to cede some domain names, but the service has so far managed to quickly resurface using slightly altered ones (Kravets, 2016). As for approaches like #icanhazPDF, although the actions are in principle illegal, it would be extremely difficult to take legal action. WHY HAS BLACK OA BECOME SO POPULAR Black OA has grown very rapidly in the last 3–4 years. The reasons are slightly different for the two subspecies. Authors who have joined ASNs probably find it easy to just post the exact published PDF of their article there, no questions asked. The alternative, using their institutional repository, would entail first finding out the exact meaning of the complex copyright and licence agreements they sign with the publisher. After that there would often be the extra work of formatting the manuscript, inserting a title page, and reformatting for instance tables and figures which often have been separate files before submission. From the reader's viewpoint ASN copies are as easily findable as other types of green OA. In a Google scholar search a free Research Gate copy will show up in a column to the right, the same way an institutional or subject repository one will. A basic Google search will primarily point to the publisher's version, usually behind a pay wall. But simply adding ‘Research Gate’ to the title in the search string will take you to the copy, if there is one. As for Sci-Hub it is a pure pirate site, which has not asked for consent from authors or publishers. The repository has downloaded more than 50 million journal articles directly from the publishers’ websites (Bohannon, 2016). This has been accomplished using the passwords of individual researchers to their university library portals for mass downloading, but it is unclear if the passwords have been voluntarily given by the individuals in question, or whether they have been obtained by phishing. Slightly cumbersome for readers is that Sci-Hub copies do not show up in Google or Google Scholar searches. The user has to go to the site itself (which is constantly changing name, due to lawsuits from the big publishers) and input the digital object identifier (DOI) or the title of the article he searches for. In case it cannot be found this actually triggers Sci-Hub software to go and find and retrieve it. Hence the site is used more as a last resort when a free copy cannot be found otherwise. It is definitely quicker than mailing authors in the hope of obtaining a copy, not to mention the archaic and slow method of interlibrary loan, if that is even a possibility. And for many younger academics and students paying pay-per-view charges is out of the question. The strength of Sci-Hub is currently that it is much more comprehensive than ASNs or repositories which only contain selected articles rather randomly. And many of the users of Sci-Hub, despite this, say they use it more for convenience than to save cost (Charleston Conference, 2016). In summary, for both ASNs and pirate sites there are three major reasons why they have become so popular with both authors and readers. Ease of use, the fact that they are found morally acceptable by most academics (Travis, 2016) and the almost non-existent legal risks involved in up- and downloading individual articles. CONCLUSIONS In a nutshell, around 25% of recent research articles (after a year) are accessible as gold OA, and an additional 15–20% can be found as legal green copies. Of the remaining 50% the vast majority are findable as illegal black OA copies. The direct negative effects of black OA on mainstream subscription publishing, in terms of decreasing revenue, have so far probably been negligible. A major reason is that most of the sales revenue is in the form of huge electronic big deals, which usually span several years. Also the publishers exert huge lock-in power, so that it is almost impossible for a library to refuse a deal with one of the major publishers. There is thus a lot of inertia in the system, isolating it from negative impacts of both green and black OA. The loss of income could potentially be bigger in less-developed countries with strained university budgets, but publishers get much less income from those anyway and in many cases offer free access. The biggest effect of black OA could in fact be in diluting the popularity of green OA channels, in combination with publishers tightening the embargo rules, which in institutional repositories tend to follow. If anything, black OA should be seen as a symptom of a seriously flawed mainstream scholarly publishing model, which has failed to adequately adapt to the needs of the international research community. Black OA is obviously not a solution to the problems, the remedy is (in my opinion) 100% gold OA for research papers funded by APCs or other mechanisms. If and when we get there the ‘market demand’ for retrieval via sites like Research Gate and Sci-Hub will disappear, and the use of subject and institutional repositories will be reduced to preprint manuscripts, grey literature, and overlay purposes. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS On a personal note I have a wide-ranging experience of the channels discussed in this article. I have published in both free and APC-charging OA journals, in a delayed OA journal, and some articles of mine in subscription journals are hybrid OA. I have uploaded many manuscript copies to my university's institutional repository, to a personal website shared with a colleague, and some of my articles can be found in PMC. Co-authors have uploaded articles to Research Gate, and the one subscription journal article I specifically checked via Sci-Hub was indeed retrievable. REFERENCES Archambault, E. (2014).

AB  - Open access publishing (OAP) makes research output freely available, and several national governments have now made OAP mandatory for all publicly funded research. Gold OAP is a common form of OAP where the author pays an article processing charge (APC) to make the article freely available to readers. However, gold OAP is a cause for concern because it drives a redistribution of valuable research money to support open access papers in ‘mega-journals’ with more permissive acceptance criteria. We present a data-driven evaluation of the financial ramifications of gold OAP and provide evidence that gold OAP in mega-journals is biased toward Western industrialized countries. From 2011 to 2015, the period of our data collection, countries with developing economies had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in the lower-tier mega-journals and thus paid article APCs that cross-subsidize publications in the top-tier journals of the same publisher. Conversely, scientists from Western developed countries had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in those same top-tier journals. The global inequity of the cross-subsidizing APC model was demonstrated across five different mega-journals, showing that the issue is a common problem. We need to develop stringent and fair criteria that address the global financial implications of OAP, as publication fees should reflect the real cost of publishing and be transparent for authors.

AB  - Abstract The study examined the research impact of gold open access (OA) journals in engineering and technology. A total of 37 gold route journals that request article processing charges (APC) and 66 other OA journals without APC in the field were found in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and used for the study. The publishers, APC charges and the year each journal was added to DOAJ were identified and included in this study An informetric approach was used to extract research impact indicators (citations, paper productivity, cite/paper, cite/journal and h-index) of journals. Findings revealed that the publishers of the APC journals were dominated by commercial publishing companies producing over 60% of the journals. Article processing charges ranged from 7.6 USD to 3471.5 USD while the average article processing charges for APC journals was 727 USD. Gold route open access (APC) journals performed better than open access non-APC OA journals since they produced 51.2% of the papers, 71.8% of the total citations and 65.1% of the total h-index. However, findings showed a weak positive correlation between articles processing charges (APC) of the gold route journals and their research impact; while there is high significant positive correlation between research impact of gold route (APC journals) and non-APC open access journals.

AB  - What should the relationship be between the purely Open Access publishers and librarians? Yes, in theory, among publishers these are publishers who are fully aligned with libraries to end the stranglehold which the traditional subscription publishers have on libraries. Yes, they are 100% attribution-only (CC-BY) publishers living up to the goals of Open Access (as described in the Budapest Open Access Initiative [BOAI]). But, are they just replacing over-priced subscriptions with over-priced APCs (Article Processing Charges)?

AB  - Google Scholar has become an important player in the scholarly economy.Whereas typical academic publishers sell bibliometrics, analytics and ranking products, Alphabet, through Google Scholar, provides "free" tools for academic search and scholarly evaluation that have made it central to academic practice.Leveraging political imperatives for open access publishing, Google Scholar has managed to intermediate data flows between researchers, research managers and repositories, and built its system of citation counting into a unit of value that coordinates the scholarly economy.At the same time, Google Scholar's user-friendly but opaque tools undermine certain academic norms, especially around academic autonomy and the academy's capacity to understand how it evaluates itself.

AB  - The degree to which scholarly journal articles published in subscription-based journals could be provided open access (OA) through publisher-permitted uploading to freely accessible web locations, so called green OA, is an underexplored area of research. This study combines article volume data originating from the Scopus bibliographic database with manually coded publisher policies of the 100 largest journal publishers measured by article output volume for the year 2010. Of the 1.1 million articles included in the analysis, 80.4 % could be uploaded either as an accepted manuscript or publisher version to an institutional or subject repository after one year of publication. Publishers were found to be substantially more permissive with allowing accepted manuscripts on personal webpages (78.1 % of articles) or in institutional repositories (79.9 %) compared to subject repositories (32.8 %). With previous studies suggesting realized green OA to be around 12 % of total annual articles the results highlight the substantial unused potential for green OA.

AB  - The Working Group on Expanding Access to Published Research Findings reported to the UK's Minister of Universities and Science in mid-2012. This was followed by a new policy for open access (OA) publishing by Research Councils UK (RCUK) as well as a commitment from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to require that research submitted to future research evaluation exercises – after the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) – be open access. These initiatives build on a broad consensus, that includes for-profit publishers, that open access is the way of the future. Here, I give a perspective on these issues, both as the head of an institution with particular interests in the future of scholarly publication and also as a member of the Working Group on Expanding Access. The continuing development of informed debate will be critical for the future of the scholarly publishing system.

AB  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) models play a crucial role in various NLP tasks, including information extraction (IE) and text understanding. In academic writing, references to machine learning models and datasets are fundamental components of various computer science publications and necessitate accurate models for identification. Despite the advancements in NER, existing ground truth datasets do not treat fine-grained types like ML model and model architecture as separate entity types, and consequently, baseline models cannot recognize them as such. In this paper, we release a corpus of 100 manually annotated full-text scientific publications and a first baseline model for 10 entity types centered around ML models and datasets. In order to provide a nuanced understanding of how ML models and datasets are mentioned and utilized, our dataset also contains annotations for informal mentions like “our BERT-based model” or “an image CNN”. You can find the ground truth dataset and code to replicate model training at https://data.gesis.org/gsap/gsap-ner.

AB  - The article describes the results of the online survey on open science (OS) carried out on researchers affiliated with universities and Spanish research centres and focused on open access to scientific publications, the publication process, the management of research data and the review of open articles. The main objective was to identify the perception and habits of researchers with regard to practices closely linked to open science and the scientific value added is that offers an in-depth picture of researchers as one of the main actors to whom this transformation and implementation of open science will fall. It focuses on the different aspects of OS: open access, open data, publication process and open review in order to identify habits and perceptions. This is to make possible an implementation of the OS movement. The survey was carried out among researchers who had published in the years 2020-2021, according to data obtained from WoS. It was emailed to a total of 8,188 researchers and obtained a total of 666 responses, of which 554 were complete, the rest being forms with some questions unanswered. The main results showed that open access still requires the diffusion of practices and services provided by the institution, as well as training (library or equivalent service) and institutional support from the competent authorities (vice rectors or equivalent) in specific aspects such as data management. In the case of data, around 50% of respondents stated they had stored data in a repository, and of all the options, the most frequently given was that of an institutional repository, followed by a discipline repository. Among the main reasons for doing this, we found transparency, visibility of data and the ability to validate results. For those who stated they had never stored data, the most frequent reasons for not having done so were privacy and confidentiality, the lack of a mandated data policy or a lack of knowledge of how to do it. In terms of open peer review, participants mentioned a certain reticence to the opening of evaluations due to potential conflicts of interest that may arise or because lower-quality content might be accepted in order to avoid conflicts. In addition, the hierarchical structure of senior researcher versus junior researcher might affect reviews. The main conclusions indicate a need for persuasion of OA to take place; APCs are an economic barrier rather than the main criterion for journal selection; OPR practices may seem innovative and emerging; scientific and evaluation policies seem to have a clear effect on the behaviour of researchers; researchers state that they share research data more for reasons of persuasion than out of obligation. Researchers do question the pathways or difficulties that may arise on a day-to-day basis and seem aware that we are undergoing change, where academic evaluation or policies related to open science, its implementation and habits among researchers may change. In this sense, more and better support is needed on the part of institutions and faculty support services.

AB  - This paper reports on a study — overseen by representatives of the publishing, library and research funder communities in the UK — investigating the drivers, costs and benefits of potential ways to increase access to scholarly journals. It identifies five different but realistic scenarios for moving towards that end over the next five years, including gold and green open access, moves towards national licensing, publisher-led delayed open access, and transactional models. It then compares and evaluates the benefits as well as the costs and risks for the UK. The scenarios, the comparisons between them, and the modelling on which they are based, amount to a benefit-cost analysis to help in appraising policy options over the next five years. Our conclusion is that policymakers who are seeking to promote increases in access should encourage the use of existing subject and institutional repositories, but avoid pushing for reductions in embargo periods, which might put at risk the sustainability of the underlying scholarly publishing system. They should also promote and facilitate a transition to gold open access, while seeking to ensure that the average level of charges for publication does not exceed circa £2,000; that the rate in the UK of open access publication is broadly in step with the rate in the rest of the world; and that total payments to journal publishers from UK universities and their funders do not rise as a consequence.

AB  - A few commercial publishers dominate provision of access to scientific and technical information sought after by researchers around the world.Increasing subscription prices of journals at rates higher than general inflation caused librarians to think of forming consortia, but publishers started selling online journals as bundles, and libraries ended up with many journals their researchers have very little use for.Scientists and librarians adopted open access, but publishers came up with hybrid journals and article processing charges to beat any adverse effect on their profits caused by the fast-spreading open access movement.We compare the steps taken by scientists and librarians in the West to reclaim ease of access to research findings with what is happening in India.We end with a few suggestions.

AB  - Knowledge graph (KG) schema, which prescribes a high-level structure and semantics of a KG, is significantly helpful for KG completion and reasoning problems. Despite its usefulness, open-domain KGs do not practically have a unified and fixed schema. Existing approaches usually extract schema information using entity types from a KG where each entity e can be associated with a set of types {Te, by either heuristically taking one type for each entity or exhaustively combining the types of all entities in a fact (to get entity-typed tuples, (h_type, r, t_type) for example). However, these two approaches either overlook the role of multiple types of a single entity across different facts or introduce non-negligible noise as not all the type combinations actually support the fact, thus failing to capture the sophisticated schema information. Against this background, we study the problem of modeling hyper-relational schema, which is formulated as mixed hyper-relational tuples ({Th}, r, {Tt}, k, {Tv1},...) with two-fold hyper-relations: each type set T may contain multiple types and each schema tuple may contain multiple key-type set pairs (k, Tv). To address this problem, we propose HELIOS, a hyper-relational schema model designed to subtly learn from such hyper-relational schema tuples by capturing not only the correlation between multiple types of a single entity, but also the correlation between types of different entities and relations in a schema tuple. We evaluate HELIOS on three real-world KG datasets in different schema prediction tasks. Results show that HELIOS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hyper-relational link prediction techniques by 20.0-29.7%, and is also much more robust than baselines in predicting types and relations across different positions in a hyper-relational schema tuple.

AB  - SUMMARY The complexity of e-journal subscription management is requiring subscription agents to re-invent themselves to meet new demands. E-journal subscriptions have many more components, including licensing, registration, access, usage statistics, and archiving. By consolidating information and providing one-to-many and many-to-one flows of information, agents can provide efficiencies in operational tasks as well as simplifying the financial transactions. Agents also can add value in negotiations and in aggregating access to e-journals. Agents are making changes in processes such as speeding communications to publishers, partnering with third party content hosting services, and entering into discussions about standards for communication of electronic subscription information. This paper was presented as part of a panel that included presentations by Steve Bosch and Selden Lamoureux.

AB  - The University Libraries at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) have an active and growing implementation of Open Journal Systems (OJS), a free, open source scholarly publishing platform. But even a free software system is not without its costs, both to the hosting institution and to the creators and staff of individual journals. Institutions that wish to host OJS must be able to install, maintain, and support the product. And while faculty members and other academics are often experts in their content areas, not all of them are prepared to handle other needs associated with creating and publishing an online journal—including decisions that might involve article layout, copyright policies, graphic design, web design, and other technical issues. This article provides an overview of UNCG’s support for OJS, as well as challenges, lessons learned, and future directions related to this service.

TI  - Historical Assessment of Three Extinct Portable Peer Review and Cascade Peer Review Models
IS  - 1

C1  - , Singapore.
AB  - Portable peer review (PPR) refers to peer review that is not conducted by a journal but instead by externally recruited peers whose reports are then made available to that journal's editors.In theory, this would alleviate a journal editor's responsibilities and potentially benefit authors by shortening the time to a decision.While the upside to this model is self-evident, PPR suffers from potential biases since knowledge by the reviewer that they will be paid may skew the outcome of peer review.In one form of PPR, cascade peer review (CPR), a rejected paper is passed down, or cascaded, often to a lower-tier journal within the same publisher's journal fleet, usually accompanied by the rejected journal's reviewer reports.CPR might be perceived as unfair to other authors who have passed a more standard route of rejection and resubmission to the same journal.For these reasons, papers that used either external PPR, or internal CPR, should transparently indicate this fact in both HTML and PDF versions of the paper so that an impression is not created that the authors, journal and publisher are concealing an important part of that paper's publication history.Three experimental paid PPR services (Rubriq, Axios Review, and Peerage of Science) that have now ceased to exist are examined in detail to appreciate their potential weaknesses, allowing academics to learn possible pitfalls in PPR and CPR models.Three reasons might explain their failure and/or lack of adoption: 1) opacity of the use and acknowledgement of such services, thus being a potential ethical infraction; 2) the creation of a two-tier system that favors only well-funded authors who are able to pay for such an exclusive service; 3) risk of peer review bias.

AU  - Buitrago, Jairo
C1  - University of Ottawa, Canada
AB  - The topic of predatory publishing and ways to combat it is garnering considerable attention in many parts of the developed world, where academic librarians are emerging as leaders in this regard. However, less is known about how this phenomenon is playing out in developing regions, including Spanish-speaking Latin America. This study presents the results of a survey of 104 academic librarians in this region, along with follow-up interviews with seven respondents. The findings reveal that scholarly publishing literacy in general, and predatory publishing in particular, currently has low visibility in this part of the world, although there is growing recognition of and increasing concern about the issue. Although there is some debate about whether scholarly publishing literacy should be the sole responsibility of the library, many participants agree that the library has a role to play. Moreover, while most of the librarians who participated perceive that they have a solid knowledge of open access, they are less confident in their understanding of predatory practices and are seeking to increase their skills and knowledge in this regard to better support researchers at their institutions. To address this shortcoming, academic librarians in the region have expressed an interest in receiving training and in participating in international collaborations with other libraries that have already developed resources or programming in this area.

The data were gathered by means of an online questionnaire survey, which obtained 263 Chinese ECRs’ responses. The main conclusions are: (a) journal-based indicators (e.g. journal reputation, Journal Impact Factor, Science Citation Index, etc.) are crucial when Chinese ECRs read and publish; (b) assessment policy plays a vital role when Chinese ECRs decide where to publish; (c) open access and open data have been widely recognized and warmly welcomed by Chinese ECRs, however, they will only publish in open access journals and open their research data if they get rewarded by the evaluation system; (d) most Chinese ECRs had good experience of peer review and they are in favor of double blind peer review; (e) Chinese ECRs are heavy users of social media, they are sophisticated in finding scholarly information online and communicating with peers and colleagues with social media tools.

AB  - Questionable journals represent an increasing problem in scholarly communication. The warnings about such journals are plentiful, but the methods used to identify them vary a great deal and make it difficult to accurately determine which journals are fraudulent or simply of low quality. This article presents an overview of the existing frameworks for identifying questionable journals and discussions around them. Most of the frameworks rely on describing the journals under investigation according to a set of criteria, and some can even be turned into a metric or mechanism. The development of frameworks for identifying questionable journals has so far been characterized by a great diversity in format, length, and content. Generally, the frameworks come with little information on development, validation, and reliability. The consequences of prolific tool development are discussed, and a recommendation for testing such frameworks is proposed.

AB  - This article addresses some of the issues arising from the continuing research and debate on open access (OA) publishing, primarily from the perspective of an academic in the field of humanities. As an academic, the author feels it is essential that scholars embrace the responsibility of being part of the process that reconsiders how to publish their research, and that they recognize they have a key role to play amongst a variety of stakeholders. The launch of the Open Library of Humanities (OLH) in early 2013 and its growing momentum as a scholarly-led movement over the last 12 months demonstrates that there is an increasing awareness amongst the academic community in the humanities of what is required to build a new kind of publishing model. Aspects of this 'do-it-yourself' culture are considered along with various funding options, concluding with a look at international challenges facing the transformation towards open access and where the OLH fits into the picture.

AB  - The number of manuscripts submitted to most scholarly journals has increased tremendously over the last few decades and shows no sign of leveling off. Water, Air and Soil Pollution is no exception in this respect. In 1980, WASP published 89 articles, for a total of 1,008 pages. By 1990, the number of published articles had risen to 259, occupying 2,700 pages. That amounted to a roughly 200% increase in 10 years! In 2009, the journal published 297 articles, occupying 3,601 pages. In other words, in the last 30 years, the page count of WASP has increased by 260%. And still, this volume of published scholarship, in effect, is only the tip of the iceberg. Many more articles are submitted than are published. In recent years, probably thanks in part to the steadily rising impact factor of the journal (from 1.058 in 2004 to 1.398 in 2009), the total number of manuscripts submitted to WASP has sky rocketed. In 2009, the journal received a total of 1,204 manuscripts. Again, this situation is not unique. Many other journals report similar trends (e.g., Baveye et al. 2009; Baveye 2010). If the recent past, with the enormous increase in scholarly production in countries like China and India, is any indication of what lies ahead, a publishing “tsunami” is looming, for which we are hardly prepared at all (Baveye 2010). This frenzy to publish, manifested across the board, is making it more and more difficult for editors and associate editors of scientific journals to secure peer reviews in a timely fashion for the manuscripts they handle (e.g., Baveye et al. 2009; Martin et al. 2009). We hear from fellow editors that it is becoming less and less uncommon to have to issue 10 to 15 invitations before one can secure the peer reviews needed to assess a given manuscript. Even though WASP fares generally better than this, it is certainly true that a high proportion of review invitations are declined. Most often, researchers declining invitations to review invoke the fact that they are too busy to add yet another item to their already overcommitted schedule. Yet, however one looks at it, peer reviewing in any of its different flavors (e.g., open, single, or double-blind) is a crucial component of the publishing process. Nobody has yet come up with a viable alternative. Therefore, we need to find a way to convince our colleagues to peer review manuscripts more often. This can be done with a stick or with Water Air Soil Pollut DOI 10.1007/s11270-010-0355-7

C1  - NOASP, Cappelen Damm Akademisk
AB  - One of the objectives of the open access movement has been to upend the traditional model for scholarly publishing by making research findings freely available to anyone, anywhere. The trend emerged partly in response to the major publishing houses having become the gatekeepers of the dissemination of research findings and setting high prices for access to this material via subscriptions to scholarly journals.On the face of it, this state of affairs suggests that commercial actors have no place in the realm of open access publishing. However, an argument can be made to the effect that commercial companies have a part to play in transforming the way scientific publication works and contribute to making research freely available. Having numerous interested parties in the OA domain may contribute towards making research accessible, leading to a general increase in innovation. This is necessary in a field that by and large is in its infancy, technologically, politically and economically. An OA initiative that is part of a profit-driven organization does not preclude it from contributing to a sustainable publishing model, and a commercial approach is not necessarily incompatible with the principles. In this poster we offer NOASP as an example, and part of the wider context of commercial open access publishing. Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing is an open access publisher of scholarly journals and books in Scandinavia and a subdivision of Cappelen Damm Akademisk. NOASP was established in 2015 – and continues to grow. In our experience, meeting the very specific criteria for Open Access publishing requires substantial investments in technology and human resources. Publishers who choose to establish themselves in this niche area must have a long-term strategy and develop specific expertise. Competition between publishing houses and other actors provides incentives for staying abreast of new requirements and standards, technology and infrastructure. These strategic and economic factors directly and positively impact the quality of journals and publishing solutions, and ultimately contribute to innovation in the field. The economics of commercial publishing, by heightening competition between the services publishers provide, therefore leads to improvement of both technical platforms and editorial practices. In turn, this leads to higher quality of the end product and broader distribution of the freely available research, which should ultimately be the goal of the OA movement.

AB  - Professors and associate professors (“professors”) in full-time positions are key personnel in the scientific activity of university departments, both in conducting their own research and in their roles as project leaders and mentors to younger researchers. Typically, this group of personnel also contributes significantly to the publication output of the departments, although there are also major contributions by other staff (e.g. PhD-students, postdocs, guest researchers, students and retired personnel). The scientific productivity is however, very skewed at the level of individuals, also for professors, where a small fraction of the professors, typically account for a large share of the publications. In this study, we investigate how the productivity profile of a department (i.e. the level of symmetrical/asymmetrical productivity among professors) influences on the citation impact of their departments. The main focus is on contributions made by the most productive professors. The findings imply that the impact of the most productive professors differs by scientific field and the degree of productivity skewness of their departments. Nevertheless, the overall impact of the most productive professors on their departments’ citation impact is modest.

AB  - Peer-review is an essential activity for the vast majority of credited scientific journals and represents the cornerstone for assessing the quality of potential publications, since it is substantially aimed to identify drawbacks or inaccuracies that may flaw the outcome or the presentation of scientific research. Since the importance of this activity is seldom underestimated by some referees, the purpose of this article is to present a personal and arbitrary perspective on how a scientific article should be peer-reviewed, offering a tentative checklist aimed to describe the most important criteria that should be considered. These basically include accepting the assignment only when the topic is in accordance with referee's background, disclosing potential conflicts of interest, checking availability and time according to size and complexity of the article, identifying the innovative value of the manuscript, providing exhaustive and clear comments, expressing disagreement with a fair and balanced approach, weighting revisions according to the importance of the journal, summarizing recommendations according to previous comments, maintaining confidentiality throughout and after the peer-review process. I really hope that some notions reported in this dissertation may be a guide or a help, especially for young scientists, who are willing to be engaged in peer-review activity for scientific journals.

AB  - The increasing governmentalization and commodification of knowledge are putting intense pressure on scholars to write and publish more, and in accordance with conventions that are not of their own making, due to benchmarks of success set by the applied sciences that suit business and the state. These tendencies are also producing a potentially unsustainable environmental burden that may be increasing, not decreasing, as we move more and more into an online publishing world. This recognition leads to three provocations: 1) There is too much scholarly publication to keep up with, and too much pressure to publish; 2) The future of all academic publishing will largely be determined by the sciences; and 3) We must consider the relative merits of publishing electronically rather than on paper in terms of the environment - in other words, asking “how green is this paper?”

AB  - This study explores early career researchers’ (ECRs) appreciation and utilisation of open access (OA) publishing. The evidence reported here results from a questionnaire-based international survey with 1600 participants, which forms the second leg and final year of a four year long, mixed methods, longitudinal study that sought to discover whether ECRs will be the harbingers of change when it comes to scholarly communications. Proceeding from the notion that today’s neophyte researchers, believed to hold millennial values of openness to change, transparency and sharing, may be best placed to power the take-up of OA publishing, the study sought to discover: the extent to which ECRs publish OA papers; the main reasons for their doing or not doing so; and what were thought to be the broader advantages and disadvantages of OA publishing. The survey data is presented against a backdrop of the literature-based evidence on the subject, with the interview stage data providing contextualisation and qualitative depth. The findings show that the majority of ECRs published in OA journals and this varied by discipline and country. Most importantly, there were more advantages and fewer disadvantages to OA publishing, which may be indicative of problems to do with cost and availability, rather than reputational factors. Among the many reasons cited for publishing OA the most important one is societal, although OA is seen as especially benefiting ECRs in career progression. Cost is plainly considered the main downside.

AB  - Peer review provides the foundation for the scholarly publishing system. The conventional peer review system consists of using authors of articles as reviewers for other colleagues' manuscripts in a collaborative-basis system. However, authors complain about a theoretical overwhelming number of invitations to peer review. It seems that authors feel that they are invited to review many more manuscripts than they should when taking into account their participation in the scholarly publishing system. The high number of scientific journals and the existence of predatory journals were reported as potential causes of this excessive number of reviews required. In this editorial, we demonstrate that the number of reviewers required to publish a given number of articles depends exclusively on the journals' rejection rate and the number of reviewers intended per manuscript. Several initiatives to overcome the peer review crises are suggested.

AB  - Introduction: Campus affordability initiatives promote the adoption of free, low-cost, and open educational materials. Coordinators first need to understand faculty usage of instructional course materials, textbook selection authority, and their price tolerance for, knowledge of, and use of open educational resources (OER). Methods: Faculty at a medium-sized research university in the Midwest were invited to participate in an online survey about their current use of instructional course materials, their knowledge of material cost, and student purchasing habits. The survey had a completion rate of 128 responses, representing all teaching ranks on campus. Results: Instructors assign a wide range of materials and rarely hear from students about their inability to purchase textbooks. The majority find US$100 or more an acceptable price and believe that more than 70% of students purchase all required items. Over half of respondents make the final decision about their materials, and factually accurate content is the top priority when making selections. Eighty percent have some awareness of OER, but OER use is low. Discussion: Response rate was too low to make general assumptions but suggests areas for further exploration and provides base data when working with departments. A faculty member’s selection authority could be limiting OER use and impacting students. Discussions need to take place about an acceptable price for department courses and how faculty decide to require materials. Conclusion: Outreach to campus partners should promote high-quality materials as instructors consider this the most when selecting resources. Further examination of how selection authority impacts OER use and student success need to occur.

AB  - What does it cost to make a high quality, digital monograph? What may sound like an obvious question turns out to be a very knotty one, driving to the heart of the essence of scholarly publishing today. It is particularly relevant in an environment where the potential of a sustainable open access (OA) business model for monographs is being explored. Two complementary studies funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2015 have explored this question to understand the costs involved in creating and disseminating scholarly books.

AB  - The study investigates Library and Information Science (LIS) journals that published research articles between 2003 and 2013, which were about open access (OA) and were indexed in LIS databases. The purpose was to investigate the journals’ OA policies, ascertain the degree to which these policies facilitate OA to publications, and investigate whether such texts are also available as OA. The results show that literature growth in the domain has been significant, with a total of 1,402 articles produced during the eleven years under study. The OA policies of the fifty-six journals that published the highest number of articles were analysed. The results show that most articles (404; 41%) were published in hybrid journals, whereas 272 (29.7%) appeared in OA journals. Some 143 (53%) of the articles published in hybrid journals were available as green OA copies. In total, 602 (66%) of all the articles published were available as OA. The results show that the adoption of OA for research articles on that very subject is somewhat higher than in other fields. The study calls on LIS professionals to be conversant with the OA policies of the various journals that may publish their research.

AB  - Open access, open data, open source and other open scholarship practices are growing in popularity and necessity. However, widespread adoption of these practices has not yet been achieved. One reason is that researchers are uncertain about how sharing their work will affect their careers. We review literature demonstrating that open research is associated with increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities. These findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices.

IS  - 1
VL  - 2
AU  - Sayab, Maryam
AB  - The article discusses the issue of predatory publishers and journals, which exploit academia's "publish or perish" culture by offering quick publication without proper peer review, editorial oversight, or quality control in exchange for hefty publishing fees.To address the issue, many researchers and publishing professionals rely on anonymously managed lists of predatory journals and publishers to identify and avoid disreputable publishing outlets.However, the reliability of such lists is questionable and their criteria for determining what constitutes a predatory journal or publisher may not be transparent or objective.Anonymous list creators may have their own agendas or personal biases that influence their decisions, leading to the inclusion of legitimate publishers or the exclusion of predatory ones.Additionally, such lists may perpetuate systemic bias and include journals with limited resources that are legitimate.Therefore, it is important to use these lists in conjunction with other sources of information, such as official blacklists maintained by reputable organizations or publisher directories that provide transparent information about the publishing process and policies.Ultimately, researchers and scholars must exercise due diligence when selecting publishers and journals to safeguard the credibility of the scientific community.

AB  - Many librarians support faculty with the publishing process, which includes journal selection and evaluating the impact of their scholarly output. While large universities have the resources for entire departments devoted to bibliometrics, the authors of this article give strategies for faculty publishing support at a smaller liberal arts university. The authors created a LibGuide with publishing resources and presented the initiative to several academic divisions. Faculty were surveyed, and the results indicated that the majority of respondents were interested in assessing journal quality and viewed the library as a resource for help with the publishing process.

TI  - How society publishers practice open science beyond open access publishing?
AU  - Pölönen, Janne
AU  - Late, Elina
C1  - Federation of Finnish Learned societies
AB  - Scholarly publishing has rapidly moved towards open access (OA) over the last few decades. However, OA publishing is only one part of a larger open science movement. The recent UNESCO recommendation for open science (UNESCO, 2021) defines open science broadly to cover the openness of scientific knowledge, science infrastructures, engagement with societal actors, and dialogue with other knowledge systems. In its recommendations, open scientific knowledge includes OA to scientific publications but also open research data, metadata, open educational resources, software, and source code and hardware. Earlier research about open scientific knowledge from the point of view of academic publishers has mainly been focused on one element such as OA publishing and neglected other elements.This paper aims to fill this gap by surveying how society publishers in Finland adopted other elements of open scientific knowledge. In Finland, learned societies account for 70% of national journal output (Late et al., 2020) and their publishing model is mainly diamond open access, which excludes author processing charges and relies on publishing subsidies (Pölönen et al., 2020). Furthermore, their activities often go beyond scholarly publishing to include education and research activities such as funding research and collecting and storing research data (Korkeamäki et al., 2019).We conducted an electronic survey addressed to Finnish learned societies in November 2021 to answer the following research questions: “To what degree society publishers take up the elements of open scientific knowledge including open access to publications, open data, and open education?” (RQ1) and “Are elements of open scientific knowledge cumulative?” (RQ2)In total 97 society publishers responded (40% response rate). We analysed their responses through nine variables measuring how they adopted different elements of open scholarly knowledge (Table 1) in view of the UNESCO recommendations for open science.&#x0D; The results show elements related to open scholarly publications prevail. Almost 70% of respondentspublish either gold, green, or hybrid OA publications. Most society publishers reported to support open data policies only some do collect, store, and provide open access to research datasets. Furthermore, only a few societies offer training for opening research data. Even so, a high share of publishers offers open education, and some share their educational materials openly. Although earlier studies have reported differences in adopting open science between disciplines (Rousi &amp; Laakso, 2020), our analysis does not support these findings.However, it has confirmed that adopting the elements of open scholarly knowledge is cumulative, as OA publishers are more likely to take up other elements of open scholarly knowledge. However, adopting all elements is not yet common. Since activities (e.g. collecting research data, offering education, etc.) of publishers other than societies seem to influence the take up of these elements, further research of their activities is needed. For example, it will show how often and how openly these other publishers provide research data or education beyond.

AB  - According to the policies of a number of indexing database agencies and the Principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly publishing 3rd version, archiving of scholarly journal articles is mandatory for editors and publishers.Furthermore, publishers in Korea have been required to deposit journal article files in the National Library of Korea since February 2016 by law.This study presents background information on archiving sites and how to deposit digital files in the Library's archive.Although some archiving sites for scholarly journals have been developed internationally, it may be burdensome for publishers in Korea (almost all of which are academic societies) to use those sites to deposit digital files because a deposit fee is required by some agencies.Furthermore, PubMed Central, maintained by the United States National Library of Medicine, accepts only English-language biomedical journals.In contrast, it is possible for publishers to deposit articles in the National Library of Korea by uploading files without any fees, regardless of the journal language.Furthermore, publishers can select the access policy of their journals.All journal publishers and editors in Korea are recommended to utilize the archiving site of the National Library of Korea to preserve their journal articles.

AB  - Abstract Peer review plays an essential role as one of the cornerstones of the scholarly publishing system. There are many initiatives that aim to improve the way in which peer review is organized, resulting in a highly complex landscape of innovation in peer review. Different initiatives are based on different views on the most urgent challenges faced by the peer review system, leading to a diversity of perspectives on how the system can be improved. To provide a more systematic understanding of the landscape of innovation in peer review, we suggest that the landscape is shaped by four schools of thought: The Quality &amp; Reproducibility school, the Democracy &amp; Transparency school, the Equity &amp; Inclusion school, and the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school. Each school has a different view on the key problems of the peer review system and the innovations necessary to address these problems. The schools partly complement each other, but we argue that there are also important tensions between them. We hope that the four schools of thought offer a useful framework to facilitate conversations about the future development of the peer review system.

AB  - The Internet has enabled an easy method to search through the vast majority of publications and has improved the impact of scholarly journals. However, it can also pose threats to the quality of published articles. New publishers and journals have emerged so-called open-access potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers and journals, and so-called hijacked journals. It was our aim to increase the awareness and warn scholars, especially young researchers, how to recognize these journals and how to avoid submission of their papers to these journals.Review and critical analysis of the relevant published literature, Internet sources and personal experience, thoughts, and observations of the authors.The web blog of Jeffrey Beall, University of Colorado, was greatly consulted. Jeffrey Beall is a Denver academic librarian who regularly maintains two lists: the first one, of potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers and the second one, of potential, possible, or probable predatory standalone journals. Aspects related to this topic presented by other authors have been discussed as well.Academics should bear in mind how to differentiate between trustworthy and reliable journals and predatory ones, considering: publication ethics, peer-review process, international academic standards, indexing and abstracting, preservation in digital repositories, metrics, sustainability, etc.

VL  - 2
AU  - da Silva, Jaime

AB  - When academics’ opinions, which are published in academic journals as letters to the editor or commentaries, are retracted based on sensitivities and objections that are raised for example on social media, there needs to be a reflection on what this might represent. On one hand, an opinion is precisely that, i.e., a subjective and biased view about an issue. Those views might even be radical, unpopular, or insensitive, but ultimately approved by editors for publication nonetheless. To maintain a truly sustainable scholarly discourse, the best academic way to counter such opinions is by allowing disagreeing voices to express themselves, also as letters to the editor or commentaries. Pressure-induced retractions of opinions not only stifle academic debate, they send the message that opinions need to be moderated and standardized to meet a publishing market that is being increasingly driven by legal parameters, political correctness, as well as business and commercial values rather than academic ones. In an environment of restrictive academic freedom, what emerges is an academia in which the way things are said, tone, and the sensitivity of those that might be affected are given greater weight than the message itself. By cherry-picking parts of the message that detractors or critics might disagree with, the original message may be drowned out by the noise of the objectors. The struggle of academics to liberally voice their opinions in the scholarly publishing realm, and to preserve those opinions, has never been more acute in this age of misinformation and radicalism fueled by polarized social and mass media. Is the politicization and/or commercialization of academia, alongside the retraction of opinions, stifling open and healthy academic debate, or expressing itself as the retraction of opinions, and does this represent a distinct form of “cancel culture” in academia and academic publishing?

AB  - Crowdsourcing has become the mot du jour when it comes to resolving any types of problems, online or offline, that require sustained human involvement. We see it applied in order to motivate employees to engage with less rewarding daily routines, to attract the best possible ideas and approaches to boost innovation, or to complete data processing tasks that computing technology has yet to master quickly and accurately.In this paper we look at its various forms and flavors, from gamification to human computation and grand challenges, and discuss how it could be used to turn conventional content management applications into social machines in which tasks are performed as optimal combinations of human and computational intelligence. We introduce a framework for the analysis of the most important building blocks of such systems, as well as design and participation best practices that should guide their development.

AB  - Article discussing how we pay for scholarly publishing. Since at least the late 1970s, when stresses in the market for scholarly literature began to show, there have been calls to redistribute how the production and dissemination of scholarly literature are paid for. The motivations are addressing the free rider problem of institutions without presses and, more recently, increasing overall access to the literature. In particular, the last few years have seen schemes such as SCOAP3 and Knowledge Unlatched and proposals from K | N Consultants and a joint task force of the Association of Research Libraries and the American Association of Universities. These plans to establish new business models are summarized.

The growth in this market has provided opportunities for scholarly publishers to deliver targeted and relevant mobile content and information to their customers. Most innovative publishers have started to experiment with mobile strategies, and have developed applications for iPhone, Android and BlackBerry. However, since these devices are based on different technology platforms, development for multiple devices inevitably means significant duplicated effort as application code cannot be shared between them. HTML5 provides publishers with a new set of powerful technologies to mitigate this problem. By using HTML5 and web services, publishers can cut out wasted effort and build cross-platform apps which work on all current mobile devices.This paper explores the options in more detail, and shows how publishers can reduce development costs, improve time to market and deliver more futureproof mobile applications.

Although the world wide web profoundly changed scholarly publishing (and of course many other things), HTML did not become the standard document format for scientific papers. In fact, there is no standard document format.

AB  - ABSTRACT The paper summarizes the findings of a pilot study for the National Humanities Alliance, including the methodology, research tools, analysis, and initial conclusions about the publishing business of eight association published humanities and social sciences journals in the context of a move to an open access (author/producer pays) publishing model. The eight disciplines represented by these journals are modern languages, history, religion, economics, sociology, anthropology, politics and statistics. Specific tools were developed for the study to enable like‐for‐like comparison of the journals. Detailed information on current trends in revenue, costs, and surplus is included. Significant differences between HSS and STM journals are reviewed. Open access to research articles on publication as the ‘gold’ author/producer‐pays approach would not be sustainable for this sample of HSS journals for reasons articulated in the report. Further studies using the tools and methodology developed are required to broaden and confirm these results.

AB  - Predatory publishing has risen with the development of open access publishing. This study examines how many potential predatory journals were used by Brandon University students by analyzing their bibliographies. In total, 245 bibliographies including 2,359 citations were analyzed. Of the 1,485 citations to journals in these citations, five were found to cite journals on Beall’s List of Predatory Journals and Publishers. The probable sources of these journals in the students’ bibliographies were examined.

AB  - The advent of the Internet and the subsequent adoption of Open Access schemata are changing the nature of the scholarly discourse. In response, we seek to stimulate a debate about the role and desired forms of Open Access publishing in the context of the Information System (IS) discipline. We explore the potential contribution of an Open Access perspective on publishing IS-related research and also discuss the roles of traditional journals and their prospects in the contexts of our observations. In particular, we focus on the new possibilities of publishing work-in-progress and its potential benefit for knowledge dissemination including the prospects of turning today's limited scholarly exchange into mass collaboration. We illustrate our vision with a working prototype of an Open Access disciplinary repository entitled Sprouts (http://sprouts.aisnet.org). Our aim is to inspire new thinking about the role of Open Access publishing, the potential of its application to disciplinary repositories of emergent work, its anticipated repercussions on our work practices, and its long-term implication for the impact of IS scholarship and the well-being of our community at large. We call for participation and further action in realizing a global repository of IS research in progress. This paper builds on a panel on Open Access that was presented at the 2008 International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), held in Paris, France, in December 2008.

AB  - Previous research on faculty publication venue choice at R1 institutions reveals tension between the benefits of open access and institutional pressure for faculty to publish in specific journals for review purposes. How does this tension percolate through regional campuses with different institutional priorities, and what can these contexts reveal about publishing practices and priorities for different kinds of faculty? In this study, the authors used content analysis on transcripts of interviews of sixteen faculty from regional campuses of an R1 institution to better understand the perception of open access publications as a venue choice.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has illustrated the lack of a holistic approach in implementing Open Science (OS), leading to an inability to fully utilise its potential to inform prompt, evidence-based policy responses. In this view, this study aims to identify and categorise the factors influencing the adoption of OS and proposes possible actions for decision-makers to develop relevant policies. To achieve this, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 experts from Australia, France, the Netherlands, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States as well as eminent international entities. During the interviews, they were asked to answer a range of questions that emerged from a systematic literature review. The responses were coded and analysed using a grounded theory approach. This led to the identification of four thematic clusters, containing a total of 24 factors that can either enable or inhibit OS practices, namely, (a) external; (b) institutional and regulatory; (c) resource-related; and (d) individual and motivational. Drawing upon Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development framework, we also propose a conceptual model that integrates these factors, accompanied with corresponding actions, into a tangible process of OS policy design and implementation.

AB  - Following the examples of SCOAP3, in which libraries fund open access, and eLife, in which funding agencies have begun to directly fund open access scholarly publishing, this study presents an analysis of how creatively combining these two models might provide a means to move toward universal open access (without APCs). This study calculates the publishing costs for the funders that sponsor the research and for the libraries that cover unsponsored articles for two nonprofit biomedical publishers, eLife and PLOS, and the nonprofit journal aggregator BioOne. These entities represent a mix of publishing revenue models, including funder sponsorship, article processing charges (APC), and subscription fees. Using PubMed filtering and manual-sampling strategies, as well as publicly available publisher revenue data, the study found that, in 2015, 86 percent of the articles in eLife and PLOS acknowledge funder support, as do 76 percent of the articles in the largely subscription journals of BioOne. Such findings can inform libraries and funding agencies, as well as publishers, in their consideration of a direct-payment open access model, as the study (a) demonstrates the cost breakdown for funder and library support for open access among this sample of X articles; (b) posits how publishing data-management organizations such as Crossref and ORCID can facilitate such a model of funder and library per-article open access payments; and (c) proposes ways in which such a model offers a more efficient, equitable, and scalable approach to open access across the disciplines than the prevailing APC model, which originated with biomedical publishing.

AB  - ABSTRACT Specialists in serials have been dealing with the effects of an imbalance in the scholarly communication process for some time. The increase in scholarly output coupled with the decreasing ability of libraries to provide access to that output due to spiraling journal costs has created tensions for libraries and their communities. By advocating and providing a means to provide open access to scholarly output, institutional repositories have been promoted as one strategy for redefining the scholarly communication model. Since January 2003, the University of Oregon libraries have been exploring this approach. The article will discuss the challenges and opportunities that such repositories face and examine their effectiveness in changing the nature of scholarly communication. This will be done primarily through a case study of the experience of the University of Oregon Libraries.

AB  - The viability of gold open access publishing models into the future will depend, in part, on the attitudes of authors toward open access (OA). In a survey of academics at four major research universities in North America, we examine academic authors’ opinions and behaviors toward gold OA. The study allows us to see what academics know and perceive about open access models, their current behavior in regard to publishing in OA, and possible future behavior. In particular, we gauge current attitudes to examine the perceived likelihood of various outcomes in an all-open access publishing scenario. We also survey how much authors at these types of universities would be willing to pay for article processing charges (APCs) from different sources. Although the loudest voices may often be heard, in reality there is a wide range of attitudes and behaviors toward publishing. Understanding the range of perceptions, opinions, and behaviors among academics toward gold OA is important for academic librarians who must examine how OA serves their research communities, to prepare for an OA future, and to understand how OA impacts the library’s role.

AB  - Open scholarship, such as the sharing of articles, code, data, and educational resources, has the potential to improve university research and education as well as increase the impact universities can have beyond their own walls. To support this perspective, I present evidence from case studies, published literature, and personal experiences as a practicing open scholar. I describe some of the challenges inherent to practicing open scholarship and some of the tensions created by incompatibilities between institutional policies and personal practice. To address this, I propose several concrete actions universities could take to support open scholarship and outline ways in which such initiatives could benefit the public as well as institutions. Importantly, I do not think most of these actions would require new funding but rather a redistribution of existing funds and a rewriting of internal policies to better align with university missions of knowledge dissemination and societal impact.

AB  - Abstract This article analyses the impact and visibility of scholarly journals in the humanities that are publishing in the national languages in Finland, Norway and Spain. Three types of publishers are considered: commercial publishers, scholarly society as publisher, and research organizations as publishers. Indicators of visibility and impact were obtained from Web of Science, SCOPUS, Google Metrics, Scimago Journal Rank and Journal Citation Report. The findings compiled show that in Spain the categories “History and Archaeology” and “Language and Literature” account for almost 70% of the journals analysed, while the other countries offer a more homogeneous distribution. In Finland, the scholarly society publisher is predominant, in Spain, research organization as publishers, mostly universities, have a greater weighting, while in Norway, the commercial publishers take centre stage. The results show that journals from Finland and Norway will have reduced possibilities in terms of impact and visibility, since the vernacular language appeals to a smaller readership. Conversely, the Spanish journals are more attractive for indexing in commercial databases. Distribution in open access ranges from 64 to 70% in Norwegian and Finish journals, and to 91% in Spanish journals. The existence of DOI range from 31 to 41% in Nordic journals to 60% in Spanish journals and has a more widespread bearing on the citations received in all three countries (journals with DOI and open access are cited more frequently).

AB  - Abstract Institutional repositories (IR) maintained by research libraries play a central role in providing open access to taxpayer-funded research products. It is difficult to measure the extent to which IR contribute to new scholarship because publisher self-archiving policies typically require researchers to cite the “version of record” of a manuscript even when an IR copy is accessed to conduct the research. While some studies report an open access (OA) citation advantage resulting from the availability of self-archived or “green” OA manuscripts, few have sought to measure an OA citation effect of IR separately from disciplinary repositories, including arXiv and PubMed Central. In this study, the authors present a bibliometric analysis examining correlations between search engine performance of items in IR, OA availability from different types of repositories, and citations. The analysis uses a novel, open dataset of IR access and usage derived from five months of Google search engine results pages (SERP) data, which were aggregated by the Repository Analytics and Metrics Portal (RAMP) web service. Findings indicate that making OA copies of manuscripts available in self-archiving or “green” repositories results in a positive citation effect, although the disciplinary repositories within the sample significantly outperform the other types of OA services analyzed. Also evident is an increase in citations when a single manuscript is available in multiple OA sources.

AB  - The aim of the present article was to investigate, through a literature analysis, how contemporary modes of production impact univer-sity presses considering the social, political and economic contexts. The methodological approach consisted of two stages of collec-tion from the Web of Science database: in the first stage we retrieved 42 items related to changes in university presses over the last few years. In the second stage we analyzed 62 papers, related to information technology, refined from the concept of open access as a socio-technical concept. Five categories were selected for the content analysis of the papers: a) publishing market; b) dynamics of publisher; c) interaction with libraries; d) science communication, e) copyright. As the result, we discuss the advantages and potential of open access literature as of 2000, as well as the challenges for ideal, unrestricted and unlimited access to the intellectual production. We argue that further studies should focus on public and private relations, restricted access or open access, production resources, market, book prices, relations of publishing houses and other entities, institutions or companies, treatment of copyright, rep-resentation of society, committees and editorial boards.

AB  - This is a case study about the creation of open science services in the University of Eastern Finland. The library has overseen the open science services that have been actively implemented from 2010 onwards due to the development of the digitalisation of science and open science policies. A survey was conducted to determine how the UEF's academic faculty use the services provided as well as their attitudes towards opening their own research findings in this manner. The researchers seem to be most interested in issues that influence their daily work, i.e. data management plans and opening their publications. It seems that the culture of openness is still at the development stage within UEF. The innovators, i.e. active research groups and researchers, are already practicing and encouraging openness, but the majority of the academic staff seems to be either unaware of open science or unwilling to implement it, due to the fact that incentives and career advancements still support the traditional way of conducting research.

AB  - The Croatian Scientific Bibliography - CROSBI is a bibliography web site that stores information about scientific papers published in Croatia in the last 15 years. At the present, CROSBI consists of over 400,000 records and is daily accessed and updated by a large number of researchers. As the appearance and purpose of database (and hence its structure) changed over the years, some inconsistencies emerged, and existing data could not be used to its fullest potential, e.g. linking papers from the same journal or conference, or analysis of scientific activity in relation to the place of article publication. This paper explores the possibilities of improving and enriching the CROSBI database, using different techniques, from data cleaning and sanity checking, to creating links between CROSBI and similar online bibliographic databases. In order to improve data quality, book records from CROSBI were linked to the corresponding Google Books records, and using Semantic Web technologies, a number of links between CROSBI and online bibliographic databases was created. The resulting data set can be used to further improve the quality of CROSBI by creating a recommender system, or to improve and open up new possibilities in the analysis of existing data.

AB  - World‐wide calls for improvements in access to journal literature are being answered by a plethora of projects and services. Consortial purchasing, national licences and “big deals” dominate changes in collection development. Moves to set up affordable easy‐to‐use electronic document delivery services offer an alternative model based on single‐article purchase. More radical barrier‐free access models are moving the economic emphasis away from purchasing to input‐payments. Are all these projects and services making a difference or will access to journal literature be no better in years to come than it is now? It is arguable that only those initiatives which are developing new models through collaboration between the stakeholders will succeed in making a major breakthrough in access.

This paper examines the opportunities libraries have in requesting public information through open records requests to better support their purchasing decisions. The case is made for investing time up front to better understand contract terms and pricing already secured by public entities, using that knowledge to improve their position in the negotiating process.

The issues I will discuss will be improving the transparency and credibility of Open Access Publishing and what a service like DOAJ tries to contribute in that regard. I will discuss the problems related to Hybrid Open Access publishing especially in relation to the way that the open access mandate United Kingdom has adopted, which has led to huge support to Hybrid OA-publishing at the expense of pure OA-publishing, which has given OA-publishing a bad name in the UK. As well I will discuss the need for marginalizing and eliminating the problem of unethical, questionable OA-publishers. Further I will discuss a number of future demands on Open Access journals in terms of providing more granular measures of impact (beyond the terrible Journal Impact Factor), the need for policies related to research data and related issues.

AB  - ABSTRACT Academic libraries should be considered research tools, co‐evolving with technology. The Internet has changed the way science is communicated and hence also the role of libraries. It has made it possible for researchers to provide open access (OA) (i.e. toll‐free, full‐text, online access, web‐wide) to their peer‐reviewed journal articles in two different ways: (i) by publishing in them in OA journals, and (ii) by publishing them in non‐OA journals but also self‐archiving them in their institutional OA archives. Librarians are researchers' best allies in both of these strategies. Examples of these strategies are described. We conclude that an official mandate for OA provision is necessary to accelerate its growth and thereby the growth of research usage and impact worldwide.

AB  - We discuss the scholarly publication model and the impact of the current technological change on knowledge and communication generally on the scholarly publication model. We propose that, rather than open access being the cause of the apparent and impending collapse of the scholarly publication industry, it is but one driver of a far wider change in scholarly publication. That change will have effects that extend well beyond the simple decision of whether a publication should be available by subscription or by one of the forms of open access. We also present several other changes to scholarly publication. The change is inevitable but its extent is as yet unclear.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationships between income inequality, economic growth and the main macroeconomic factors in Tunisia. We investigate two effects: the effect of inequality on growth, and particularly, the effect of growth on inequality. Also, attention has been focused on the role of the monetary policy, via introducing money supply as an independent variable, in affecting inequality and growth. Our empirical study is based on a series of annual data from 1975 to 2015 using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) method in order to estimate the cointegrating equations. The findings of the paper show that income inequality increase economic growth in Tunisia. Other factors having significant positive effect on economic growth include money supply and life expectancy at birth. However, inflation rate, primary education and unemployment have statistically significant and negative effect on economic growth. On the other hand, the results indicate that money supply, inflation rate, unemployment and savings are positively and significantly related to income inequality, whereas, life expectancy at birth and gross fixed capital formation decrease inequality in Tunisia. The policy implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Abstract When the Internet came into being, the information services industry entered an increasingly turbulent phase. It has become clear that traditional relationships in the information chain have changed radically with the advancement of electronic information delivery. Libraries, publishers, and subscription agents alike are being presented with challenges to their familiar roles and to their positions in our industry. Web technology and Internet distribution offer new opportunities to disseminate and access information. The downside of the Internet is the increased complexity of the industry in which we operate, with more suppliers, more formats, new types of relationships, more platforms, new pricing and licensing models, and new ways of buying and selling information. This includes the upsurge of consortia, increasing demand for individual articles, and linking ofvarious content types. It is becoming apparent that the future of the current subscription model and the journal in its present form has become questionable. All of these developments have resulted in new processes, operations, and systems, highlighting the strong need for agents to act as infomediaries in the electronic environment as the complexity increases. In this presentation we will assess current developments, future trends, and their impact on the value chain in general and, more specifically, the role of infomediaries. This timely assessment is relevant to all NASIG constituents as the roles of librarians, publishers, and subscription agents alike are being challenged by these developments. The world in which we now operate will be significantly different, possibly even unrecognizable, in the relatively short space of the next five years.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine how libraries can create relative bargaining power and presents a methodology for analyzing collections and preparing for negotiations. Design/methodology/approach A brief literature review of the current state of collection budgets and electronic resource prices is presented prior to proposing a methodology based on business analysis frameworks and techniques. Findings Electronic resource subscription prices are increasing at a rate significantly higher than inflation, while collection budgets grow slowly, remain stagnant or decrease. Academic libraries have the ability to counteract this trend by creating relative bargaining power through organizational efforts that take advantage of size and concentration (e.g. consortia), vertical integration through practices such as library publishing and open access and through individual efforts using information. This paper proposes metrics and methodologies that librarians can use to analyze their collections, set negotiation priorities and prepare for individual resource negotiations to create relative bargaining power. Practical implications The proposed methodology enables librarians and buyers of information resources to harness the information available about their electronic resource collections to better position themselves when entering negotiations with vendors. Originality/value This paper presents metrics, some not commonly used (i.e. average annual price increase/decrease), that aid in understanding price sensitivity. Pareto analysis has been traditionally used to analyze usage, but this paper suggests using it in relation to costs and budgets for setting negotiation priorities.

AB  - The difference between the advanced and developing countries in the matter of access to information for research has been continually increasing. The advent of the Internet and electronic sources of information has not only exacerbated the gap but also led to the exclusion of developing country researchers from taking part as equal partners in publishing, refereeing, and in international collaboration. If handled imaginatively, the very same technologies can help bridge the information gap between the rich and the poor countries and help improve research productivity worldwide. Many initiatives that are already in place are described and suggestions are given on steps to be taken by developing country researchers.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to implement information security risk management (ISRM) in research information systems (RIS).Appropriate identification and assessment of risks in different aspects such as software, communications, and human resources for RIS's besides providing efficient and effective preventive and corrective actions are other aims of this study.Furthermore, continual improvement of risk response processes in information technology environment is another aim of this study.In this study, potential risks of information security are identified using failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).Also, detected failure modes are evaluated by multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) using a hybrid method of fuzzy logic, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Shannon entropy scoring method, and technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS).The result of this paper shows that information security software potential risks assessment by the proposed model is more accurate and reliable than non-fuzzy models.Unauthorized access to view or change the stored information of the server is the risk with the most important priority identified by MCDM approach.Confidentiality of information is more important than other information security criteria.Furthermore, failure modes in the category of the main server and internet have more priority in comparison to others.

AB  - The open science and research (OSR) movement has been shaping the world of scholarly communication for a few years now. In Finland, the Ministry of Education and Culture promoted research information availability and open science through the Open Science and Research Initiative. As a part of this initiative, an evaluation of the openness of Finnish research organizations was completed. The first evaluation indicated that OSR functions needed clearer guidelines and a coordinating unit to further improve the cultural maturity in Lahti University of Applied Sciences (LAMK). Furthermore, the scholarly publishing activities also needed a new home base due to organizational changes. As the information and library services had the basic understanding of scholarly publishing, different publishing channels and responsible conduct of research, it was decided that the library takes on these responsibilities.&#x0D; For the new challenges, the traditional information specialist skills set needed updating. New skills were acquired via both formal and informal learning, benchmarking and trial-and-error. These new skills were immediately put to use in LAMK by creating a new open access publishing platform, organizing workshops and lectures for the staff and creating organizational guidelines for open RDI practices. The next organizational maturity evaluation ranking round proved the library’s new expertise, as LAMK climbed two levels up, being the second highest university of applied sciences in Finland.&#x0D; As for the role of the information specialists, the new role as OSR experts have opened up new possibilities within the organization. They are now seen more as possible partners in different RDI activities, participating in project work and further developing the way openness is being carried out in all aspects of RDI and teaching. The paper offers a case example of how library professionals can diversify and update their skills pool and shape the future of their profession.

AB  - The increasing volume and complexity of research, scholarly publication, and research information puts an added strain on traditional methods of scholarly communication and evaluation. Information goods and networks are not standard market goods – and so we should not rely on markets alone to develop new forms of scholarly publishing. The affordances of digital information and networks create many opportunities to unbundle the functions of scholarly communication – the central challenge is to create a range of new forms of publication that effectively promote both market and collaborative ecosystems.

AB  - ABSTRACT Digital journals have been widely adopted by academic researchers and have nearly replaced printed journals in many contexts. The adoption of digital books is accelerating. The transition to digital information has changed information workflows of researchers by transforming the methods they use to find, store, retrieve, and use information from monographs, journals, and other sources. It has also changed the needs and expectations of scholars in relation to research information. To investigate these changes, 45 researchers in science, medicine, engineering, social sciences, and humanities at Stanford University were interviewed regarding information workflow and preferences. Results are compared with the findings of the e‐Journal User Study (eJUSt), completed in 2002.

AB  - As publishers and vendors offer more electronic resources, the number of licenses that have to be negotiated and executed increase proportionally. Libraries and publishers often have conflicting goals, making the successful outcome of a license negotiation difficult to obtain. A small group of licensing professionals gathered for a frank, open discussion of the terms and conditions that are important to each side, thereby opening the channels of communication on a larger scale. The discussion panel consisted of three academic librarians and two publisher representatives; the moderator is an academic librarian and a member of the Shared Electronic Resource Understanding (SERU) Working Group, as is one of the panelists. The goal of the session was for each side to come away with a greater understanding of the other's positions on key license points, as well as some strategies for arriving at compromises. The mission of SERU was discussed and promoted, creating more awareness on both sides of the table of the existence and usefulness of SERU as an alternative to the cumbersome license negotiation process.

AB  - OpenBiodiv is a biodiversity knowledge graph containing a synthetic linked open dataset, OpenBiodiv-LOD, which combines knowledge extracted from academic literature with the taxonomic backbone used by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The linked open data is modelled according to the OpenBiodiv-O ontology integrating semantic resource types from recognised biodiversity and publishing ontologies with OpenBiodiv-O resource types, introduced to capture the semantics of resources not modelled before.We introduce the new release of the OpenBiodiv-LOD attained through information extraction and modelling of additional biodiversity entities. It was achieved by further developments to OpenBiodiv-O, the data storage infrastructure and the workflow and accompanying R software packages used for transformation of academic literature into Resource Description Framework (RDF). We discuss how to utilise the LOD in biodiversity informatics and give examples by providing solutions to several competency questions. We investigate performance issues that arise due to the large amount of inferred statements in the graph and conclude that OWL-full inference is impractical for the project and that unnecessary inference should be avoided.

We also note some of the changes we have introduced in terms of the journal’s content and policies. A key argument is that even though publishing infrastructures shape the form and movement of scholarly content in crucial ways, they often remain black-boxed, rendering invisible the time, labor, and skill in developing and sustaining them.

AB  - Library-run institutional repositories face a crossroads: adapt or die. The “build it and they will come” proposition has been decisively proven wrong. Citation advantages and preservation have not attracted faculty participants, though current-generation software and services offer faculty little else. Academic librarianship has not supported repositories or their managers. Most libraries consistently under-resource and understaff repositories, further worsening the participation gap. Software and services have been wildly out of touch with faculty needs and the realities of repository management. These problems are not insoluble, especially in light of Harvard University arts and science faculty’s recent permissions mandate, but they demand serious reconsideration of repository missions, goals, and means if we are to be ready for Harvard imitators, and especially to be ready should those imitators not surface.

AB  - Background: In the face of extensive, developed-world library endorsement of open access (OA) and not-for-profit publishing, large commercial journal publishers are, paradoxically, increasing market share by means of economies of scale brought about in part by ownership concentration.Analysis: While the market success of commercial journal publishers may benefit from ownership concentration, it is argued that market-oriented innovation has also contributed to their market success. A review of the very lively state of market-oriented innovation in journal publishing and usage metrics is undertaken and three innovation proposals derived from commercial magazines are introduced.Conclusion and implications: The adoption of reader-focused features of commercial journals and the adaptation of the mobile-oriented strategy of commercial magazine publishers that respond to the modern digital information environment and mindset are recommended as strategically sound. Partnering with low-cost promoting, OA-oriented libraries may hobble the ability of not-for-profit journals to maximize their value to researchers.Originality/value: The weakness of OA as a constraining publishing strategy is brought forward and compared to readership building through innovation focused on usage.

Design/methodology/approach A summary of the main points of the meeting. Findings This Congress included the major themes that brought together the research communities, the libraries and librarians, the scholarly publishing enterprises and highlighted the technologies in place to make OA a viable solution to the scholarly communication problems that currently exist. Originality/value By reviewing OA strategies and initiatives in place around the world at different institutions in different countries it is clear that there are ways to lay this groundwork so that long‐term success can be achieved. Lessons learned and best practices in place lead to more articulate and comprehensive ways to approach the ongoing problems to ensure that widespread adoption is close in Italy.

AB  - To date, the Berkeley OA fund has ensured that 43 articles are free to be read immediately upon publication and 44 additional articles are now in the pipeline. The full scope of OA publishing during this period was significantly larger, at least by a factor of four. The OA fund allocation will continue to be carefully managed over the coming years. We are tracking our potential liability assuming the OA landscape grows with additional publishers and OA options. The amount predicted as necessary to maintain the fund based on the initial 18-month uptake data is US$45,000. This is less than 1% of the US$6.2 million the library invests in subscribing to closed-access digital journals. We are paying attention in particular to the attempts by the California Digital Library, which negotiates major journal publisher licenses on behalf of the UC campuses, to include terms within the licenses that enable UC authors to take advantage of publishers'hybrid OA options [16]. And it comes with far less of the myriad overhead costs associated with those closed-access subscriptions because that subscription price doesn't tell the full story of the actual cost of maintaining the subscription. Those subscriptions involve staff-intensive license negotiations. Institutions develop and maintain systems architectures in order to ensure that only authorized users have access and respond to challenges from publishers of the content when actual or potential breaches of the licenses are identified (publishers invest hugely in monitoring use of their content in order to ensure the license terms are not breached and are quite willing to contact the institutional subscriber when any untoward activity appears on their logs). They must, in certain instances, maintain the confidentiality of certain clauses in the licenses and increasingly respond to freedom of information, public records act requests related to the investments of public resources in those contracts. The need to experiment is particularly heightened during this economic crisis when investments in subscriptions are increasingly difficult to justify, particularly given the alternate forms of open access to content and decreasing ability for libraries to reliably distinguish OA and non-OA content within the journal. We believe that institutions (and the sub-institutional units that manage collection funds) should be open to exploring alternative funding models for scholarly communication. Institutions should highly value funding models that promote universal access to their research output. And during an economic crisis, these institutions should question the extensive financial and human resource investments required by the subscription model, a model that both excludes nonauthorized users and entails large-scale and complex licensing and legal obligations. The time is now for broad-scale adoption of institutional OA funds.

AB  - Institutional repositories represent extremely innovative technology, but repository managers still struggle to bring together a critical mass of content and to demonstrate their overall impact on research. In this paper I propose a set of Performance Indicators (PIs) to assess institutional repositories’ success. Fourteen internal indicators are selected and inserted in the quadruple ‘balanced scorecard’ perspective. Three more indicators from an external perspective are then proposed and discussed by the author. I hope that this study will foster the development of standard Performance Indicators for IRs in the very near future, in order to help IR managers to demonstrate their repositories’ cost-effectiveness and success.

AB  - Abstract This paper reviews how Open Access policies (OA) and Institutional Repositories (IR) might be portrayed as agents of change within the realm of scholarly publishing. Using commentary on academic publishing as background, commentary that sees OA and IR as optimal and inevitable, and beneficially disruptive of the existing system, two theoretical approaches are presented as ways of providing a more detailed and explicit analysis of OA/IR dynamics. Both theories to varying degrees derive their inspiration from an exploration of the nature of change. The first “disruptive technology/disruptive innovation” approach (Christensen) specifies change in market theory terms, a re‐structuring ‘driven’ by innovation within, and possibly disruptive of, existing market arrangements. The second approach views change as a process of ‘reassembling’ and reconfiguring of relationships between elements of a network (Actor‐Network Theory). The application of both approaches to OA/IR is explored, including reference to a case study on a university institutional repository implementation. While ‘disruption’ and similar terms might be in common and casual use, the basic idea gains greater clarity in these theories, and in doing so promotes greater awareness of the assumptions being made, and the aspirations being pursued.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to conduct a comparative analysis of institutional repositories of higher education institutions of Ukraine for training specialists in the field of information, library, and archival studies as a component of the quality of academic communication in the modern educational space. The research methodology is based on the application of the theory of scientific communication, general scientific and special methods of cognition, including analysis, synthesis, monitoring, and comparison. The scientific novelty of the study is to expand the understanding of the current situation of demand among users of scientific and educational resources of institutional repositories of higher education institutions for the training of specialists in the field of information, library, and archival studies. Conclusions. The article analyses the institutional repositories of ten higher education institutions for training of specialists in the field of information, library, and archival studies using Webometrics, QS World University Rankings, and SimilarWeb. Despite the high-ranking positions of the leading higher education institutions in Webometrics and QS World University Rankings, user access to institutional repositories remains at an insufficient level. A study based on web analytics by SimilarWeb has identified four leading HEIs by the number of visits to their repositories by users: Western Ukrainian National University (WUNU), Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (TSNU), National Aviation University (NAU), and Lesya Ukrainka Volyn National University (VNU). The level of use of the main communication channels (direct access, regular (standard) search, referrals, e-mail, social networks) for the use of repositories by each higher education institution is also determined, and recommendations are given on the promotion of scientific and educational resources of repositories and the use of PR and advertising technologies by librarians and all participants of scientific communication of higher education institutions to improve its quality in the modern educational space. Key words: institutional repository, higher education institution, electronic archive, training of specialists in the field of information, library, and archive studies, communication channels, scientific communication.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present the institutional repository (IR) named DRUGG (Digital Repository of the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering) of the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering (UL FGG), just from its beginnings in 2011, and using the statistics of visits to present its merits for higher visibility of scholarly publications on the web. The role of all stakeholders involved in the construction of this IR is highlighted. Design/methodology/approach – The historical overview of the awareness of researchers on the UL FGG on worldwide scientific communication through web sites is showed from beginning in the 1990s. Using Google Analytics the statistics of visits and downloads after a year of operations is showed, as well as the statistics of access from different networks from all over the world. Findings – In the DRUGG repository mainly theses are archived which are usually not published elsewhere. They are very interesting for professional engineers working in practice. The statistics showed that 89 per cent of all visits come from public domains, while only 11 per cent are from the home domain of the University of Ljubljana (UL). Research limitations/implications – This paper is a case study and limited only to IR DRUGG. It describes the steps taken in implementing the IR considering the technological infrastructure, human resources and collaboration of the library staff with other professional and administrative faculty units. Practical implications – The repository is to a large extent used by the professional public and that the use is not limited only to the home institution – UL. Originality/value – This paper helps in planning to build an IR. It also presents an overview of worldwide research and analysis about the influence of IRs on citations of scholarly publications to convince the sceptical research policy makers.

AB  - The need for a comprehensive infrastructure for scholarly publication information has been on the EU’s agenda for a long time. Also, the European Commission’s open science policy highlights the necessity of a good information base to follow up open access publishing across Europe. However, an all-inclusive information infrastructure on research publications is still missing. During the past 10 years, European countries have invested significantly in national research information infrastructures. Now, at least 20 European countries have a national database for research publication metadata. The strength of these databases lies in their comprehensiveness and quality assurance since they often have a mandatory nature. They are, however, neither yet integrated nor widely used for cross- country comparisons. To this end, a proof of concept of a European publication infrastructure was carried out in the framework of ENRESSH ( www.enressh.eu ). The ENRESSH-VIRTA-PoC integrated publication data from four countries and the concept was built on the strengths of the Finnish national VIRTA system. This paper highlights the results from the PoC and outlines future steps towards the integration of national publication databases in Europe.

AB  - We report on the development of an interface to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that allows for the mapping of patent portfolios as overlays to basemaps constructed from citation relations among all patents contained in this database during the period 1976–2011. Both the interface and the data are in the public domain; the freeware programs VOSViewer and/or Pajek can be used for the visualization. These basemaps and overlays can be generated at both the 3-digit and 4-digit levels of the International Patent Classification (IPC) of the world intellectual property organization (WIPO). The basemaps can provide a stable mental framework for analysts to follow developments over searches for different years, which can be animated. The full flexibility of the advanced search engines of USPTO are available for generating sets of patents and/or patent applications which can thus be visualized and compared. This instrument allows for addressing questions about technological distance, diversity in portfolios, and animating the developments of both technologies and technological capacities of organizations over time.

AB  - Quantitative data are increasingly influencing the evaluation of the effectiveness of research and researchers. Citations may be the main metric to assess the quality and value of a publication, the number of which evaluates the academic impact. Who and how is citing Ukrainian scholarly journals? And speaking about citations, what are the main connections and trends? To study these aspects, we analyzed the citations of two “young” Ukrainian journals published by the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. The authors searched for articles published by two journals (Kyiv-Mohyla Humanities Journal and Kyiv-Mohyla Law and Politics Journal) in the citation databases Dimensions, Web of Science and Scopus. With the help of bibliometric analysis, such indicators as: citation; self-citation of the author; self-citation of the journal; citations from the author affiliated with the publisher of the journal; citations from the author who has a joint affiliation with the author of the article; Altmetric Attention Score. The purpose of the study is to distinguish the publications impact in various fields of knowledge in Open Access journals for researchers around the world, the growing number of citations for English-language publications, the importance of international publishing standards, correlations for self-citation, etc. An important aim is also to summarize the importance of journal indexing in different databases. The study showed that the number of journal citations is primarily influenced by the thematic relevance of published materials. Including, the subject of the article (volume, issue) has a strong correlation with the dynamics and geography of the citations. The number of self-citations of authors, self-citations of the journal, as well as citations from the joint affiliation with the author and publisher was insignificant. No significant impact on the number of citations was also found in the date of publication and its distribution on the Internet (Altmetric). Journal indexing in abstract, full-text databases and citation databases also affects their visibility and audience.

AB  - This paper examines the evolving relationship between Canada and the African academic research community through the promotion of a concept known as Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) and with an eye to its implications for increasing the circulation of research through such means as open access (OA) publishing models. We analyze the programmatic discourse of Canada’s International Development Research Centre’s (IDRC) African research initiatives, and report on an IDRC research and development project assessing the means of increasing access to African scholarly journals through the use of open source software platforms and open access publishing and archiving models. Consistent with IDRC’s multi-year effort to contribute directly to university-based research capacities by investing in ICT infrastructure in Africa, our survey of African editors, librarians, and faculty from five African nations reveals a similar interest in developing those capacities, despite numerous challenges, through the use of online publishing systems and OA publishing models, which hold some promise of increasing access to research published in Africa.&#x0D;

AB  - Background: Open access (OA) implies free and unrestricted access to and re-use of research articles. Recently, OA publishing has seen a new wave of interest, debate, and practices surrounding that mode of publishing. Obj ectives: To provide an overview of publication practices and to compare them among six countries across the world to stimulate further debate and to raise awareness about OA to facilitate decision-making on further development of OA practices in earth sciences. M e th ods: The number of OA articles, their distribution among the six countries, and top ten journals publishing OA articles were identified using two databases, namely Scopus and the Web of Science, based mainly on the data for 2018. Results: In 2018, only 24%&amp;ndash;31% of the total number of articles indexed by either of the databases were OA articles. Six of the top ten earth sciences journals that publish OA articles were fully OA journals and four were hybrid journals. Fully OA journals were mostly published by emerging publishers and their article processing charges ranged from $1000 to $2200. Conclusions: The rise in OA publishing has potential implications for researchers and tends to shift article-processing charges from organizations to individuals. Until the earth sciences community decides to move away from journal-based criteria to evaluate researchers, it is likely that such high costs will continue to maintain financial inequities within this research community, especially to the disadvantage of researchers from the least developed countries. However, earth scientists, by opting for legal self- archiving of their publications, could help to promote equitable and sustainable access to, and wider dissemination of, their work.

AB  - Abstract The principal distinction drawn in this study is between research “internationalists” and “locals.” The former are scientists involved in international research collaboration while the latter group are not. These two distinct types of scientist compete for academic prestige, research funding, and international recognition. International research collaboration proves to be a powerful stratifying force. As a clearly defined subgroup, internationalists are a different academic species, accounting for 51.4% of Polish scientists; predominantly male and older, they have longer academic experience and higher academic degrees and occupy higher academic positions. Across all academic clusters, internationalists consistently produce more than 90% of internationally co-authored publications, representing 2320% of locals’ productivity for peer-reviewed articles and 1600% for peer-reviewed article equivalents. Internationalists tend to spend less time than locals on teaching-related activities, more time on research, and more time on administrative duties. Based on a large-scale academic survey ( N = 3704), some new predictors of international research collaboration were identified by multivariate analyses. The findings have global policy implications for resource-poor science systems “playing catch-up” in terms of academic careers, productivity patterns, and research internationalization policies.

AB  - The effect of technology has caused many institutions to intend to change their approach to teaching and learning, resulting in the current model of teaching and learning being an active collaborative and self-directed one. The connection between education and technology has received attention as part of educational policy and practice. Debatable topics like how to use technology in the classroom have therefore punctuated complaints about declining educational standards, unemployed learners, duplicate curricula, and archaic institutional structure. In the framework of information and communication technologies and societal growth, the Internet of Things (IoT) is asserting its vital position. Institutions may improve learning outcomes with the use of the Internet of Things by offering enhanced learning experiences, increasing operational effectiveness, and collecting real-time, actionable insight into student performance. The current state of the Internet of Educational Things (IoET) is examined from several educational perspectives in this article; a few of them are highlighted, and both of their established and potential educational benefits are discussed. Additionally, it provides in-depth discussions on current issues and problems for the IoET from a variety of approaches. The investigation performs a bibliometric analysis with VOSviewer to focus on peer-reviewed research articles published in well-known publications databases over the past eight (8) years. The findings of this study should also act as a strong incentive for universities and colleges around the world to use IoT-based teaching and learning technology for improved academic achievement.

AB  - Despite its capacity to reach readers irrespective of affiliation or geographic location, conversations about Open Access (OA) frequently center academic stakeholders in high-income countries. This presentation will examine opportunities for technical services librarians to explore with students some of the inequities of the scholarly communications landscape, including various approaches to and aspects of OA, and to consider the disparate levels of access available to individuals based on institutional affiliation. Because higher education settings afford students a high degree of information privilege, academic librarians face the challenge of teaching students to appreciate the value of information, acknowledge barriers to it, and identify and evaluate the freely available resources and content to which they will have access post-graduation. Although technical services and scholarly communication librarians tend to have fewer teaching responsibilities than those working in public services, our experiences with collection development, licensing, and resource description provide insights to share with students regarding information value and privilege. A case study on student projects which included the editing of Wikipedia entries highlights tensions between institutional privilege and open resources. Teaching students about the costs, processes, and value of information production empowers them to understand their privilege and responsibilities.

AB  - This paper takes an overview of the work of the Securing a Hybrid Environment for Research Preservation and Access (SHERPA) team and the SHERPA Partnership institutions in the area of developing, populating and maintaining institutional open access repositories. Crucial to this work has been the development of a mutually supporting and enabling Partnership community, something that has now been recognised as needed by institutions that lie outside it. To this end, SHERPA is involved in efforts to support the individuals and institutions across the United Kingdom and Europe who are engaging with the open access agenda on a practical level; through setting up community networks and disseminating experience. Key in the experience of the SHERPA Partnership has been the role of advocacy of open access and institutional repositories to the research community. Whilst this experience has been unique to each institution, there are many shared lessons and best practice that the Partnership has recently reflected on and that are articulated within this paper. Finally, brief coverage on some of the vital community tools developed and maintained by SHERPA, and reflections on the evolving direction of open access in the United Kingdom, are made.

They set about creating a system that dramatically reduced administration and overcame inefficient workflows for all involved.With the establishment of the 'author pays' scholarly publishing model and the increasing trend for open access mandates from research funders, have infrastructure and resources developed sufficiently to support the additional financial and time pressures that participants now face?Individual researchers, their universities and research funders, and the publishers themselves, all have a part to play in processing and managing individual fees. It appears there is a need from all participants in the industry to make provision to encompass the administration of the publication charges required by many open access publishers. Open Access Key (OAK) is a new global company with an innovative and cost-effective solution which could provide value to all parties involved in these transactions.And in addition to financial management, OAK has been built to deliver a wide range of administrative functionality to the users. For example, OAK can feed repositories with the metadata information collected from each article processed through the platform. Automated workflow again reduces the tasks of the authors and administrators allowing resources to be directed towards research.OAK has been built by Norwegian and Danish technology partners using software that delivers tremendous flexibility. At the same time, the company has created an environment that will enable the sharing of best practice models with its customers. The company's size also speeds up decision-making and reactivity. Within an OAK account, for example, there are 'feedback buttons' to enable users to pass on thoughts, requests and general comments directly to the development team. Prior to rolling out the OAK platform to a new customer, the team spends time discussing the needs within each organisation and engineering the system to meet individual specifications.

AB  - Scholarly publishing in the fields of science and engineering plays an important role in developing and disseminating knowledge. In this context, bibliometric analysis is used as a method and tool to understand trends, patterns, and impact of scientific publications. The main objective of this research is to carry out bibliometric analysis of articles published by Semarak Ilmu Publishing. Information about productivity, collaboration, and impact of publications based on the keyword “Semarak Ilmu Publishing” as publisher was explored to provide better insight into their potential contribution to improving understanding and development in the fields of science and engineering. Based on the analysis, the number of articles that were published in 2019 - 2024 reached more than 40 articles with the number of articles per year being 45 articles in 2019, 75 articles in 2020, 50 articles in 2021, 79 articles in 2022, 66 articles in 2023, and 17 articles in 2024. For the case of 2024, since it is still at the beginning of the year, the number of publications is still low. Apart from that, each article has been widely cited by other authors with an average citation per year of 263.53 citations. This research becomes an initial basis for further evaluation of Semarak Ilmu Publishing and its contribution to supporting the scientific ecosystem.

AB  - Welcome to Volcanica's first issue! Our community of editors and Volcanica supporters are excited to present you with our inaugural issue of peer-reviewed volcano research. This editorial accompanies the first issue of Volcanica so that we can provide you with some background to the Volcanica initiative, explain some of the evidence-based motivation for starting a new journal, and explore ways in which we can improve universal access to published research. We discuss our model of "diamond open access", which is entirely free for authors to publish and free for everyone to read. We will explain how this model is possible and state explicitly the challenges related to how this project can be sustainable and scalable. Finally, we will signpost the information you may need to publish with Volcanica as we continue to grow.

AB  - Introduction Lewis G. Liu (bio) The scholarly publishing market plays a critical role in modern societies since it communicates research findings to researchers, businesses, and industries. Scientific research findings are expected to lead to innovations, inventions, and new products and services that are driving forces of countries' economic growth and development. Research findings in social sciences and business are expected to provide policy guidance for improving individuals' lives and organizational effectiveness and efficiency of businesses, nonprofit institutions, and government agencies. Academic libraries have always been part of the scholarly publishing market since they represent the demand side of the market equilibrium and play an important role in acquiring, maintaining, and delivering scholarly publications. The changes in the scholarly publishing market such as price increases for packaged journal subscriptions and ebooks can have an impact on academic libraries' budgets, and therefore affect their collections and acquisitions policies and decisions. While inflation is a factor in price increases, the oligopoly behavior of a few large commercial publishers can be a cause of price increases in journal and book prices. In fact, commercial publishers have been reshaping the scholarly publishing industry in recent decades and continue to expand their presence as a dominant force in today's scholarly publishing market, whereas the presence of noncommercial publishers, particularly the presence of university presses, has been diminishing, and some of them have been consolidated into library operations (Clement 2011) to achieve economies of scope. Commercial publishers control a larger share of scholarly information products, including print books, ebooks, open access journals, and research databases. The lack of competition in the scholarly publishing market can only lead to increased prices for these information products. It is not uncommon to see a few large corporations dominating an industry in the current global [End Page 183] economic system. They hire workers to make products, and then sell them to consumers who usually are not part of the production process. What is unique in the scholarly publishing market is that scholarly content creators are also consumers of their own products and their institutions have to buy back the very creations of their own research, in many cases at a higher price than they are willing and able to pay. In this Library Trends volume, we have gathered academic researchers, practicing librarians, and library administrators who have research expertise and working experiences in their respective subject areas to examine the role and impact of commercial and noncommercial publishers in scholarly publishing on academic libraries. Given the time constraint to complete this research project and maximum total pages allowed, we are not able to address as many topics as we would like. We, however, have covered some important issues related to the theme of this Library Trends volume. Scholarly publishing mainly consists of journal and book publishing. Although consumers, providers, and content creators of scholarly journals and books are more or less the same groups of individuals and organizations, journals and books are different types of information products. Journals are demanded in a more timely manner than are books. Researchers need the most recent research results from their fellow researchers to update their own research. Journals in general are more expensive than books partly because the timely demand for journals drives up their prices. Therefore, journals and books belong to separate information markets and will be discussed as such. The Scholarly Journal Publishing Market and Academic Libraries 1989 Studies and the Collapse of the Scholarly Journal Market The scholarly journal publishing market had been more or less in equilibrium until the late 1980s when many academic libraries' budgets could no longer keep up with escalating journal prices charged by commercial publishers and started canceling journal subscriptions. Nationwide complaints about escalating journal prices prompted the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) to investigate the issue. The ARL commissioned Economic Consulting Services, Inc. (1989) to conduct an economic cost analysis of journals published by a few major commercial publishers in the fields of science, technology, and medicine. The conclusion was that journal prices charged by these commercial publishers were much higher than their costs and inflation, revealing excessive profit made by commercial publishers. In the very same...

AB  - e image of the monastic humanities scholar toiling away in a paper-laden faculty office to produce a scholarly monograph is a popular stereotype.It is popular in part because it simplifies the oen abstract, organic, and even rambling processes involved in humanities-based research.As humanists increasingly collaborate by using online and digital tools, however, the messy office metaphor requires a literal and systematic overhaul.e collaborative processes between humanities scholars and students takes this stereotype and finds new ways to create and mobilize knowledge generated in digital environments.Drawing from two gatherings of the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) project, the articles collected in these three issues (6.2, 6.3, 6.4) of Scholarly and Research Communication (SRC) work to do just that.As part of an ongoing conversation in SRC (Arbuckle, Crompton, & Mauro, 2014), these issues will continue to describe new ways humanities researchers, publishers, and policy makers can collaborate effectively to make the most of the new affordances of computational tools and methods.

AB  - Institutional repositories (IRs) currently exist in a rapidly shifting landscape without a clear consensus on their role in the academic environment. Low self-archiving rates have dampened hopes that IRs would have an impact on scholarly publishing models. Preservation programs, a stated goal of many IRs, are often not well established. In many cases, IRs are not part of a larger vision for services the library can provide to the institution, but are isolated projects without a strong base of support. Institutions are beginning to explore the role of IRs in the collection of materials like data sets. Given this environment, where will IRs be in the next five or ten years? This issue of Library Trends contains an impressive slate of articles from prominent practitioners and researchers in the field, who offer a range of perspectives on the current state of IRs in academic institutions and reflections on their future.

AB  - Changes in Academic Communication.Academic communication refers to the process that scholars and researchers all over the world spread and share relevant academic researches through various channels.In the traditional printing age, academic communication is mainly conducted through open channels such as publishing books and periodicals, etc.With the expansion of the Internet, there are richer and richer channels for academic communication.For example, scholars can use communication tools such as the virtual network forum (BBS), blog, micro blog, e-mail and social network like SNS, and instant communication tools such as QQ and MSN, etc.Publishers' Monopoly, Price Increase and Insufficient Library Funds.Academic publishers' monopoly over academic resources and constant price increase greatly restrict the conduction of academic communication and exchange activities as well as the possibility of conducting academic research innovation.Many organizations and institutions are trying to reform the current academic exchange and publish models.Some scholars believe that an ideal model is that commercialized publishers no longer participate in the process of exchanging and sharing academic information between scholars and researchers.Promotion of Academic Search Engine.As a large amount of academic information of the digital format is on the Internet, commercially operated search engines begin to dabble into the search of academic information and resources relying on the massive web database and search technology.Many students, teachers and technology workers are becoming increasingly inclined to using academic search engine to search academic information.Of course, these academic search engines, whether free or not, have brought convenience for scientific research, but they also take away some readers that should originally belong to libraries.[1]

AB  - The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL, a division of the American Library Association) has a long history of involvement in helping to shape the evolution of scholarly communications and the role of academic libraries within it. A recent milestone was the June 2019 release of the publication Open and Equitable Scholarly Communications: Creating a More Inclusive Future , with significant involvement from ACRL’s Research and Scholarly Environment Committee (ReSEC) as described in the report’s foreword. Broader in scope than past 2004 and 2007 ACRL scholarly communication research agendas, the 2019 report was more ambitious and action-oriented, and it put social justice at the center as part of ACRL’s broader core commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion.

AB  - Purpose This is a comparative investigation of how university libraries in the United States, Canada and Spanish-speaking Latin America are responding to predatory publishing. Design/methodology/approach The Times Higher Education World University Rankings was used to identify the top ten universities from each of the US and Canada, as well as the top 20 Spanish-language universities in Latin America. Each university library's website was scrutinized to discover whether the libraries employed scholarly communication librarians, whether they offered scholarly communication workshops, or whether they shared information about scholarly communication on their websites. This information was further examined to determine if it discussed predatory publishing specifically. Findings Most libraries in the US/Canada sample employ scholarly communication librarians and nearly half offer workshops on predatory publishing. No library in the Latin America sample employed a scholarly communication specialist and just one offered a workshop addressing predatory publishing. The websites of the libraries in the US and Canada addressed predatory publishing both indirectly and directly, with US libraries favoring the former approach and Canadian libraries tending towards the latter. Predatory publishing was rarely addressed directly by the libraries in the Latin America sample; however, all discussed self-archiving and/or Open Access. Research limitations/implications Brazilian universities were excluded owing to the researchers' language limitations. Data were collected between September 15 and 30, 2019, so it represents a snapshot of information available at that time. The study was limited to an analysis of library websites using a fixed set of keywords, and it did not investigate whether other campus units were involved or whether other methods of informing researchers about predatory publishing were being used. Originality/value The study reveals some best practices leading to recommendations to help academic libraries combat predatory publishing and improve scholarly publishing literacy among researchers.

AB  - Abstract Contributorship statements were introduced by scholarly journals in the late 1990s to provide more details on the specific contributions made by authors to research papers. After more than a decade of idiosyncratic taxonomies by journals, a partnership between medical journals and standards organizations has led to the establishment, in 2015, of the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT), which provides a standardized set of 14 research contributions. Using the data from Public Library of Science (PLOS) journals over the 2017–2018 period (N = 30,054 papers), this paper analyzes how research contributions are divided across research teams, focusing on the association between division of labor and number of authors, and authors’ position and specific contributions. It also assesses whether some contributions are more likely to be performed in conjunction with others and examines how the new taxonomy provides greater insight into the gendered nature of labor division. The paper concludes with a discussion of results with respect to current issues in research evaluation, science policy, and responsible research practices.

AB  - The present study aims to outline the profile of uncited or rarely cited articles indexed in the Web of Science database between 2017 and 2021. We used stratified random sampling of 14,425 journals to extract our study sample of 373 journals. The dependent variable was defined as the number of citations, with independent variables being the JCR index, maturity, quartile, language of publication, and whether the research was funded. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample according to field of research and variable. A negative binomial regression method was used to estimate which variables influence the number of citations received by articles in the sample. We found that of the 256,524 articles that make up the research corpus, 39,469 (15.39%) received no citations and 91,963 articles (35.85%) received up to four citations. The variables that positively influenced estimates of the number of citations were maturity (0.481), JCR index (0.159), and funding (0.020), while quartile (-0.170) and language (-1.032) had a negative influence on number of citations. We conclude that the pressures of academic productivism create a vicious cycle in which studies are referenced based on their ranking in the struggle for privileged editorial space, with articles in higher quartile journals being more prone to citation.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of the study This study aims to describe all unsolicited electronic invitations received from potential predatory publishers or fraudulent conferences over a 12-month period following the first publication as a corresponding author of a junior academician. Study design Unsolicited invitations received at an institutional email address and perceived to be sent by predatory publishers or fraudulent conferences were collected. Results A total of 502 invitations were included of which 177 (35.3%) had subject matter relevant to the recipient’s research interests and previous work. Two hundred and thirty-seven were invitations to publish a manuscript. Few disclosed the publication fees (32, 13.5%) but they frequently reported accepting all types of manuscripts (167, 70.5%) or emphasised on a deadline to submit (165, 69.6%). Invitations came from 39 publishers (range 1 to 87 invitations per publisher). Two hundred and ten invitations from a potential fraudulent conference were received. These meetings were held in Europe (97, 46.2%), North America (65, 31.0%), Asia (20.4%) or other continents (5, 2.4%) and came from 18 meeting organisation groups (range 1 to 137 invitations per organisation). Becoming an editorial board member (30), the editor-in-chief (1), a guest editor for journal special issue (6) and write a book chapter (11) were some of the roles offered in the other invitations included while no invitation to review a manuscript was received. Conclusions Young researchers are commonly exposed to predatory publishers and fraudulent conferences following a single publication as a corresponding author. Academic institutions worldwide need to educate and inform young researchers of this emerging problem.

AB  - Open access is at the heart of a seismic shift in scholarly publishing. In particular, gold open access (OA) has expanded at an accelerated pace, increasing in market share every year. In the gold OA model, financial viability shifts from the demand to the supply side, with article processing charges (APCs) a common scenario. Ideally, this model would be sustainable for academic research institutions, in that it would cost them cumulatively no more to pay APCs than they pay now in the traditional subscription model. APC-driven gold OA has financial and other implications for libraries, institutions, and authors. In the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-funded Pay It Forward project, we examined the viability of gold OA by looking at institutional costs, faculty and graduate student opinions, and various models for gold OA. The Pay It Forward research teams gathered a variety of qualitative and quantitative data from publishers, research libraries, and faculty and students including current APC charges, current subscription charges, journal publication costs, opinions and behavior of graduate students and faculty members regarding publishing, reading, and OA.

IS  - 46
AU  - Cheng, An

AB  - Open access journals (OAJs) have been celebrated for freeing research from paywalls and increasing the visibility of research results beyond disciplinary, academic, or financial boundaries. They have been recognized as an important part of the Open Science (OS) ecology. However, they are still viewed by some with skepticism. Given these conflicting perceptions, it would be important for LSP researchers and practitioners to understand OAJs better as they may need to work with students who are or will be part of the OS movement. Examining how open access journals describe themselves in their “Aims and Scope” (A&amp;S) statement is a worthwhile step in this direction. I analyzed the A&amp;S statements of 104 OAJs and 104 subscription-based journals. I conducted thematic analysis aided by NVivo. Although both groups of journals include some broad themes in their A&amp;S statements, there are some observable differences in the way they describe their scope and promote themselves. Using the concept of the prestige economy, I offer two theoretical insights: the OAJs journals may be selfconsciously and purposefully responding to the expectations of the prestige economy. Meanwhile, they may be redefining what is relevant in such an economy.

AB  - There is concern in the academic publishing community that it is becoming more difficult to secure reviews for peer-reviewed manuscripts, but much of this concern stems from anecdotal and rhetorical evidence.We examined the proportion of review requests that led to a completed review over a 6-year period (2009-2015) in a mid-tier biology journal (Molecular Ecology). We also re-analyzed previously published data from four other mid-tier ecology journals (Functional Ecology, Journal of Ecology, Journal of Animal Ecology, and Journal of Applied Ecology), looking at the same proportion over the period 2003 to 2010.The data from Molecular Ecology showed no significant decrease through time in the proportion of requests that led to a review (proportion in 2009 = 0.47 (95 % CI = 0.43 to 0.52), proportion in 2015 = 0.44 (95 % CI = 0.40 to 0.48)). This proportion did decrease for three of the other ecology journals (changes in proportions from 2003 to 2010 = -0.10, -0.18, and -0.09), while the proportion for the fourth (Functional Ecology) stayed roughly constant (change in proportion = -0.04).Overall, our data suggest that reviewer agreement rates have probably declined slightly but not to the extent suggested by the anecdotal and rhetorical evidence.

AB  - Depuis les premières revues en version électronique (début des années 1990) et l’utilisation par les chercheurs des réservoirs d’archives ouvertes comme mode de diffusion de leurs travaux de recherche (fin 1990), l’évolution de l’édition de revues vers un mode numérique, ouvert, est en marche et gagne tous les secteurs scientifiques, suscitant l’intérêt des chercheurs. Les revues de recherche d’architecture, d’urbanisme et de paysage n’échappent pas à cette mutation numérique et aux changements qu’elle induit, encouragée par les institutions et financeurs. Certaines revues se sont déjà transformées et le mouvement semble irréversible, mais des réticences subsistent. Après avoir présenté un état de l’art des ressources disponibles en ligne et le rôle actif des bibliothèques pour promouvoir ce format de diffusion scientifique, cet article dresse un bilan sur les conditions de mise en place de l’accès ouvert au sein des disciplines concernées : l’importance d’une politique de soutien et de la prise en compte des enjeux économiques, la pérennité des personnels œuvrant à leur rédaction et des infrastructures de diffusion, l’assurance d’un processus fiable de qualité face à la multiplication des preprints versus les exigences des organismes de financement et les freins du modèle actuel de l’évaluation des chercheurs. Diversifier les modèles de diffusion en accès ouvert de revues d’architecture, d’urbanisme et paysage pourrait créer une nouvelle dynamique, à l’exemple des pépinières, des portails de revues régionaux ou des plateformes de preprints, pour le bénéfice d’un accès durable et équitable à la recherche architecturale.

AB  - Openness, applied in scholarly and research practices, has garnered increasing interest in recent years. With the broadening reach of Open Access as an alternative scholarly publishing model, there is anticipation that open scholarship practices will produce desirable outcomes for research and access to knowledge. The purpose of this article is twofold: firstly to highlight that Open Access is more than just the removal of paywalls, and that it is part of a wider set of open practices that can potentially yield a more collaborative and equitable global landscape of knowledge production. Secondly, to present the IDS Bulletin as a case study for an Open Access publication that has evolved to adapt to a changing scholarly publishing landscape. By critiquing prevalent discourse on openness alongside this case study, we hope that this article contributes to conversations on issues at the intersection of open scholarship, collaborative research and equitable access to knowledge.

AB  - Authors often ask how long the peer review process takes. Peer review duration has attracted much attention in academia in recent years. Existing research focuses primarily on the statistical characteristics of peer review duration, with few studies considering the potential influence of manuscripts’ attractiveness. This study aims to fill this research gap by employing attention economy theory. By analysing the peer review history of articles published in The British Medical Journal and 16 information and library science journals, we find a significant negative relationship between peer review duration and the Altmetric Attention Score. Overall, our study offers a new perspective on peer review behaviour and bridges the divide between peer reviews and altmetrics.

AB  - This article uses Alan B. Krueger’s analysis of the music industry in his book Rockonomics: A Backstage Tour of What the Music Industry Can Teach Us About Economics and Life as a lens to consider the structure of scholarly publishing and what could happen to scholarly publishing going forward. Both the music industry and scholarly publishing are facing disruption as their products become digital. Digital content provides opportunities to a create a better product at lower prices and in the music industry this has happened. Scholarly publishing has not yet done so. Similarities and differences between the music industry and scholarly publishing will be considered. Like music, scholarly publishing appears to be a superstar industry. Both music and scholarly publishing are subject to piracy, which threatens revenue, though Napster was a greater disrupter than Sci-Hub seems to be. It also appears that for a variety of reasons market forces are not effective in driving changes in business models and practices in scholarly publishing, at least not at the rate we would expect given the changes in technology. After reviewing similarities and differences, the prospects for the future of scholarly publishing will be considered.

AB  - Purpose Women remain underrepresented in the production of scientific literature, and relatively little is known regarding the labor roles played by women in the production of knowledge. This study examined labor roles by gender using contributorship data from science and medical journals published by the Public Library of Science (PLOS), which require each author to indicate their contribution to one or more of the following tasks: (1) analyzed the data, (2) conceived and designed the experiments, (3) contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, (4) performed the experiments, and (5) wrote the paper. Method The authors analyzed contribution data from more than 85,000 articles published between 2008 and 2013 in PLOS journals with respect to gender using both descriptive and regression analyses. Results Gender was a significant variable in determining the likelihood of performing a certain task associated with authorship. Women were significantly more likely to be associated with performing experiments, and men were more likely to be associated with all other authorship roles. This holds true controlling for academic age: Although experimentation was associated with academically younger scholars, the gap between male and female contribution to this task remained constant across academic age. Inequalities were observed in the distribution of scientific labor roles. Conclusions These disparities have implications for the production of scholarly knowledge, the evaluation of scholars, and the ethical conduct of science. Adopting the practice of identifying contributorship rather than authorship in scientific journals will allow for greater transparency, accountability, and equitable allocation of resources.

VL  - 1
AU  - Franco, Eduardo

C1  - Department of Oncology, McGill University, 546 Pine Avenue West, Montreal, QC H2W1S6, Canada
AB  - It is axiomatic that there has never been so much research productivity as in the present time. Not only are there more trained scientists alive and productive today than at any other point in history, but the last 25 years have also brought ever increasing gains in the speed and quantity of information delivery and in our ability to store scientific knowledge electronically. This is certainly true of medical knowledge as well, and by extension, of the scientific discoveries and knowledge translation insights that help society to avert illness, prolong life, and promote health for individuals and their communities. Therefore, the answer to the question in the title of this editorial is an unequivocal ‘yes’, if we assume quite simplistically that the exponential gains in research productivity represent knowledge that is all of high quality and relevance to advance the theory and practice of preventive medicine. A more refined question is: How will this new journal operate?As the founding co-editors of Preventive Medicine Reports (PMR), we bring our new journal to the scientific community at a time when the business of scholarly publishing is being drastically remodeled. The advent of the ‘open access’ concept in academic publishing democratized access to scientific knowledge by making all papers freely available to anyone with an Internet connection, thus eliminating the need for an individual or institution to have a paid subscription. It was able to do so by shifting the costs of publishing to the source of information, i.e., authors, their institutions, and by association, the research funding agencies. Publishing electronically also lowered the costs of being an academic publisher enormously. The ‘open access’ model has begun to abolish the centuries-long inequality in access to knowledge, which had historically placed investigators in developing countries at a major disadvantage relatively to their counterparts in resource-rich settings. This inequality was particularly poignant in preventive medicine. The very countries with the greatest need for access to scientific discoveries that could alleviate their key public health concerns were prevented from doing so because their scientists and academic institutions could not afford it. The enormous success of organizations such as Public Library of Science (PLOS) and Biomed Central (BMC), which devoted themselves entirely as publishers of multiple open-access journals, was the most notable transformation in academic publishing in the last 15 years. One of these journals, PLOS One, went from a respectable 138 papers in its inaugural year in 2006 to become the largest scientific journal in the world and in history, with 31,500 articles published in 2013 alone [1].To a large extent, the spectacular success of PLOS One stemmed from its approach of not reaching decisions on whether to prioritize for peer review and publication based on criteria of relevance and interest to readers set a priori by editors and reviewers. With print journal space concerns largely obviated in the new era of electronic publishing, PLOS One's editorial policy is to accept for publication all submissions that contain intelligibly written and sound scientific findings from yet unpublished primary research studies that were conducted ethically and with integrity [2]. Peer review ensures that the decision to publish is based on pertinent content and methodological expertise. The success of this model of sound-science exclusive review is now being adopted by other traditional publishers, and is likely to dictate much of what will happen with scientific publishing in the future.The down side of the open-access model is that it was quickly perceived by pseudo-scholarly publishers as a relatively easy way to make money via catering to credulous scientists with an urgent need to publish their results. These so-called ‘predatory publishers’ [3] are likely the majority of the providers of what passes for scientific knowledge today under the guise of open access publishing. A recent compilation of potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers included 589 entries, an enormous growth since 2011 when the list was first compiled and included only 18 publishers [4].The need for PMR arises from the fact that much high quality research in prevention is of a more specialized or regional nature, but which contains sound scientific findings worthy of being placed in the public domain. By opening this new avenue, we seek to enhance knowledge translation in preventive medicine and public health. We would like to attract such important research material to PMR, a journal that is maintained by the largest of the reputable academic publishers, Elsevier. PMR will follow the open access, sound-science centered peer review model pioneered by PLOS One, which is described in our scope and aims statement as follows:“Preventive Medicine Reports is an international, open-access peer-reviewed journal affiliated with Preventive Medicine, the medical journal founded by Ernst Wynder in 1972. Like its parent journal, Preventive Medicine Reports publishes original, scholarly manuscripts on the science and practice of disease prevention, health promotion, and public health policymaking but seeks to broaden our understanding and perspective on these topics by including a wider selection of geographic and population specific studies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the impact of lifestyle and interventions on health and the role of the man-made environment on lifestyle choices. The journal welcomes submissions, especially primary reports, on the science of preventing chronic and infectious diseases; the effects of the chemical, physical, and biological environment on health, and research on the relations between socioeconomic status, health disparities, and access to care. Preventive Medicine Reports also publishes papers that have a subspecialty angle or a methodological focus. Its primary goal is to serve as a scholarly repository for the building blocks of research knowledge that inform practice and policy in disease prevention and health promotion.”Many well established subscription journals have spawned offshoot open access journals. Elsevier has had a positive experience with this model in some of its journals. For example, Molecular Genetics and Metabolism, a subscription journal, has spawned MGM Reports, an exclusively open access journal. Other Elsevier journals that are in the same pairing model are: Cell and Cell Reports, The Lancet and The Lancet Global Health, and Gene and Meta Gene. In general, they have the benefit of simplifying authors' work by allowing a manuscript to be transferred to the sister journal along with the reviewers' critiques.With PMR and its direct cooperation with its parent journal, Preventive Medicine, we have a great opportunity to innovate in scholarly publishing in public health and give authors the opportunity to keep their valid work with an established academic journal. The same experienced editorial office team that manages Preventive Medicine will maintain the day-to-day operation for PMR. Its decisions will receive guidance from a stellar editorial board of seasoned scientists, as well as from the input of ad hoc reviewers registered in a database of nearly 4000 experienced academics and practitioners of preventive medicine.Our intent is to attract the attention of our colleagues in the fields of preventive medicine and health promotion. We are confident that PMR will earn the trust and credibility that Preventive Medicine already enjoys. As co-editors we pledge to procure competent, insightful, and unbiased peer reviews for all papers that fit the scope of PMR. Between the two of us, we have more than 60 years of experience in the epidemiology of chronic and infectious diseases, psychosocial research, and the behavioral sciences, which will give PMR an eclectic skillset with which to start fresh in this brave new world of scholarly publishing.

IS  - 4
VL  - 41
AU  - Shieber, Stuart
C1  - Harvard University
AB  - Abstract In 1950, Alan Turing proposed his eponymous test based on indistinguishability of verbal behavior as a replacement for the question “Can machines think?” Since then, two mutually contradictory but well‐founded attitudes towards the Turing Test have arisen in the philosophical literature. On the one hand is the attitude that has become philosophical conventional wisdom, viz., that the Turing Test is hopelessly flawed as a sufficient condition for intelligence, while on the other hand is the overwhelming sense that were a machine to pass a real live full‐fledged Turing Test, it would be a sign of nothing but our orneriness to deny it the attribution of intelligence. The arguments against the sufficiency of the Turing Test for determining intelligence rely on showing that some extra conditions are logically necessary for intelligence beyond the behavioral properties exhibited by an agent under a Turing Test. Therefore, it cannot follow logically from passing a Turing Test that the agent is intelligent. I argue that these extra conditions can be revealed by the Turing Test, so long as we allow a very slight weakening of the criterion from one of logical proof to one of statistical proof under weak realizability assumptions. The argument depends on the notion of interactive proof developed in theoretical computer science, along with some simple physical facts that constrain the information capacity of agents. Crucially, the weakening is so slight as to make no conceivable difference from a practical standpoint. Thus, the Gordian knot between the two opposing views of the sufficiency of the Turing Test can be cut.

TI  - It’s the incentives, stupid!
IS  - 1
AU  - Longva, Leif
AU  - Smedsrød, Bård
C1  - UiT The Arctic University of Norway
AB  - Watch VIDEO. From 2004, a new incentives system for scholarly publishing was introduced in Norway. Part of the funding of the HE institutions has since been based on the amount of scholarly publishing produced per institution, as recorded in the Norwegian CRIS system, Cristin. And the incentives worked. Publishing increased more rapidly in Norway than in comparable countries, over the years following 2004 (Aagard et al. 2014). But the sheer number of journal articles, anthologies and monographs is not necessarily what best brings science forward. And now the Norwegian government has announced that the publishing count will be dropped from the funding scheme (Meld. St. 14). Thus, we suggest that the right move would be to instead direct the incentives to stimulate good, transparent open science research practice. The advantages of open science, both for further research advancement and the benefit to society, are well documented (Miedema 2022). This includes early and obstacle-free access to research output in terms of articles, peer review reports and commentaries, as well as access to the research processes with preregistration and registered reports, methods and protocols, as well as FAIR research data that enables reproducible research. So, what is needed is an incentive system that stimulates such research practices. We suggest an incentive system, through the funding schemes of the institutions. This should favour institutions that follow open science practices. The institutions will thus be incentivized to stimulate open science, and identify and remove possible bottlenecks in their organisations that may hamper execution of open science. As employers of researchers as well as support staff, the managers of the institutions will look for ways to optimize local incentives, and also how their organisation may be designed, to best live up to the ideals of open science practices. Based on the above, we suggest a systematic evaluation of each HE institution, to document how well they practice such openness in their research. To accomplish this a list of criteria that can be easily monitored and objectively evaluated is needed. Several of the open research output parameters should be easy to monitor and measure through a reporting system. The evaluation should also acknowledge that necessary limitations to open processes and outputs exists, and thus avoid biases between institutions due to the nature of their research. Incentives directed towards the institutional level to stimulate open research practices will motivate the management to stimulate their organisation in the desired direction.

AB  - A constant question I see come up for anything related to scholarly publishing—or really anything related to life in general—is: “How do I get started?” And now that I have entered the “halftime” of my life, as my husband so lovingly calls it, I see the hardest part of really any project is just figuring out how to get going. (Side note: Jonathan Schultz, our beloved Editor-in-Chief, is nodding his head knowingly as he reads this wee-bit-late column that I promised him would be early this month. We are all guilty of not knowing where to start.) Publishing used to be so much simpler. I copyedited an article and saved it on a floppy disk. I marked up paper page proofs with my purple editing pen using old school copyediting marks. I had a pica ruler and a hardcover dictionary along with paper style guides. I even used to hand code articles with XML for overtime. I will always love those overtime opportunities both for the XML knowledge and the Christmas gifts they bought my kids. Articles were published and then largely forgotten as we moved on to the next ones. Glossy journals piled up in stacks and collected dust as the same cycle repeated itself again and again. Thank you for indulging my walk down memory lane, but I am here to tell you that the way we do things today is so much better. Looking back, I think of all of those amazing articles that readers missed out […]

TI  - Jam Tomorrow, Jam Yesterday, but Never Jam Today: Some Modest Proposals for Venturing Through the Looking-Glass of Scholarly Communication
VL  - 34
AU  - Hirshon, Arnold
AB  - In the past, scholarly publishing grew in support of college and university needs to support the peer review tenure and promotion system, which itself developed to encourage the learning process through the generation of new knowledge. However, the continuation of this system of scholarly communications is threatened today by internal and external changes in four key areas: research and publishing, technology, government and society, and higher education itself. Electronic information systems hold some promise of enabling a new model for scholarly communication. Yet today we seem to be in the world of Lewis Carroll; scholarly communication had jam yesterday and it may have jam tomorrow, but scholars and library practitioners are struggling with how to have some jam today during a tortuous period of transition. This paper explores some of the causes of the current predicament and provides some modest proposals for collaborating with others in the scholarly, information, and technology communities as we venture through the looking-glass into the future of scholarly communication.

AB  - ABSTRACT Open access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. The lack of clarity of publisher permissions for archiving in OA repositories affects the adoption of the green OA route. This paper explores editorial policies and self‐archiving conditions in 1,615 Spanish scholarly journals. 48% are published by university and research institutions, 25% by associations/societies, and 17% by commercial publishers; social sciences and humanities (SSH) accounted for 67% of the journals (44.5% and 22.5%, respectively) followed by health sciences (20%); 71% offered gratis access immediately after publication, and 11% after an embargo; 31% provided some mention of author rights. Self‐archiving was specifically allowed by 65% of the journals; 52% were classified as ROMEO‐blue, 12% as green and 15% as white, and 21% could not be classified; 21%, mostly in SSH, used some type of Creative Commons license.

AB  - The Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST) has been playing a vital role in the dissemination of scholarly articles in library and information science since 1950. This paper presents the results of a bibliometric study of articles published in the JASIST from 2000 to 2007. It examines the distribution of papers under various headings, including authorship pattern and nature of collaboration, geographic distribution of articles, nature of cited and citing references, prolific authors and highly cited authors. Data were collected using the Web of Science and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Results indicate that during the sample period the rate of publication was uneven and the most prominent form of publication was articles. The trend of authorship pattern of articles is towards collaboration and authors from 47 countries contributed articles. The country-wise distribution reveals that the highest number of contributions was made by US authors followed by the UK. The number of references cited per article increased from 2000—2007 whereas articles received citations in decreasing numbers during the same period. The results suggest that articles need to have been published for more than 2 years before they receive adequate numbers of citations.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to compute the Journal Packing Density (JPD) i.e. the average research articles published in each volume or each issue of a research journal. Library and Information Science (LIS) journals published across Asia and indexed in Scopus during the period 2015 to 2019 were taken as samples. The study is based on secondary data retrieved from SCImago Journal and Country Ranking (SJCR), which includes the journals and country scientific indicators developed from the information contained in the Scopus database. In all, 14 LIS journals were identified from Asia. It was found that there are 51 sovereign nations in Asia, and 43 (84.31%) countries are actively undertaking research in LIS and only 8 (18.60%) countries are publishing LIS journals. India and Taiwan are the two leading countries in the region publishing 3 journals each. In all, 1558 articles were published by 14 LIS journals across Asia from 2015 through 2019 in 58 volumes with a JPD of 26.86 articles per journal per volume. Apart from these, research deficit in terms of journals and research articles has also been computed alongside a brief overview on how JPD of a journal can help in identifying the possibility of its predatory nature.

AB  - Peer review practices differ substantially between journals and disciplines. This study presents the results of a survey of 322 editors of journals in ecology, economics, medicine, physics and psychology. We found that 49% of the journals surveyed checked all manuscripts for plagiarism, that 61% allowed authors to recommend both for and against specific reviewers, and that less than 6% used a form of open peer review. Most journals did not have an official policy on altering reports from reviewers, but 91% of editors identified at least one situation in which it was appropriate for an editor to alter a report. Editors were also asked for their views on five issues related to publication ethics. A majority expressed support for co-reviewing, reviewers requesting access to data, reviewers recommending citations to their work, editors publishing in their own journals, and replication studies. Our results provide a window into what is largely an opaque aspect of the scientific process. We hope the findings will inform the debate about the role and transparency of peer review in scholarly publishing.

AB  - ABSTRACT This strategic session/article is an update to one given over 10 years ago at the 1994 NASIG Conference. From the publisher's and the subscription agent's view, journal pricing is described for both the traditional print and the electronic formats. The publisher's view includes what factors are considered when setting pricing. How the agent handles journal pricing is discussed in detail as well as the changes caused by the advent of the electronic journal. To complete the business picture, the agent's view shows how the service charges for libraries are calculated as part of the revenue stream for agents.

AB  - In order for innovative cross-disciplinary research to find its audience, it must be easily discovered by scholars, professional practitioners, and the public. Journal publishing programs in libraries operate under the principle that investment in open access publishing of quality peer-reviewed research is the best way to make that research visible to a global audience and to shift control of publishing from commercial entities to the academy. Library publishers are therefore not constrained, as commercial publishers are, by the need to publish only research that will ensure a profit. This means that library publishing programs can provide a home for cross-disciplinary journals that break new ground and that may take time to find an audience.&#x0D; The lack of a profit imperative for library publishing programs also means that the platform for hosting journals is provided to journals at little or no cost, which makes library publishing very attractive to editors looking for a place to publish a new journal. Once the infrastructure is operational, the cost to add a new journal to the system is negligible because the costs of maintaining the technology are already covered. This lowers the financial barriers to starting new journals, allowing editors to focus on the task of finding and publishing excellent peer-reviewed research instead of fundraising.&#x0D; Journal platforms used by library publishers are designed so that journals published on those systems automatically follow best practices and standards, such as those outlined by the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-MPH) that make the content readily discoverable by internet search engines. These platforms also integrate the use of machine-readable licenses that clearly indicate how the content can be used. In addition to infrastructure that ensures visibility, library publishing programs benefit from existing library expertise in collaboration, technology, copyright, data management, scholarly publishing, information literacy, digital preservation, and the effective promotion of online research.

TI  - Journals and Monographs: An Italian perspective

VL  - 13
AU  - Casalini, Barbara
AB  - When, some months ago, Prof. Dekeyser invited me to talk about the tendency to abandon Italian, as well as other European languages, in favour of the English language in the scientific periodicals sector, he obliged me to gather information on a sector different to the one in which I normally work. Indeed, since its beginnings, more than forty years ago, the raison d'être of Casalini Libri, the promotion and diffusion of Italian publications to libraries throughout the world, has always privileged the humanities, social sciences, history and art which reflect the prevalent character of Italian publishing. In order to have a sufficiently reliable picture of the situation, we have contacted a sample group of publishers of scholarly scientific periodicals of various types, obtaining information on the quantity of journals published, the languages used, possible total or partial changes in the choice of language over time, and the utilisation, present or future, of electronic resources. Subdividing the contacted publishers into 4 groups in order to illustrate certain lines of conduct indicates the results of this enquiry [1]. A separate section will then be dedicated to the developments in electronic publishing, with particular regard to the choice of language. The 4 groups are: · Academies · Small specialised scientific publishers · Large specialised scientific publishers · University Presses

AB  - ABSTRACT It is now widely accepted that there are two routes to open access (OA): OA repositories and OA journals. It is often assumed these are distinct alternative parallel tracks. However, it has recently become clear that there is potential for repositories and journals to interact with each other on an ongoing basis and between them to form a coherent OA scholarly communication system. This paper puts forward three possible models of interaction between repositories and journals; services such as arXiv and PubMed Central, and the work carried out by the RIOJA project, are working exemplars and pilot implementations of these models. The key issues associated with the widespread adoption of these models include repository infrastructure development; changing ideas of the ‘journal’, ‘article’, and ‘publication’; version management; quality assurance; business and funding models; developing value‐added features; content preservation; policy frameworks; and changing roles and cultures within the research community.

AB  - The increasing number of journals makes it difficult to decide the right venue for manuscript submission. This becomes more complicated as the selection criteria may vary from one discipline to another. Therefore, appropriate cross‐disciplinary studies are required to understand the exact concerns that dominate a particular field. The current study compares 16 factors that influence journal choices between medicine and social sciences using the answers given to a global survey of 235 open access journal authors. The results reveal that authors of both areas consider ‘peer reviewed’ status as the most important factor while showing the least interest to the ‘number of annual subscribers’ of the journal. However, compared to social science authors, those in the discipline of medicine give significantly more consideration to (1) impact factor, (2) the inclusion of the journal in abstracting and indexing services, (3) publisher's prestige, and (4) online submission with tracking facility. The factors that were identified can be categorized for both disciplines as reflecting the reputation of a journal, performance or production issues, and reliability and demand characteristics of their publication choice. The editors and publishers can use these findings to attract the best manuscripts as the study reveals the author's perception of the journal's status. The results can also be used to design recommender systems for journal submission for new authors in a discipline.

AB  - Abstract The list of potential, possible or probable predatory scholarly open access (OA) publishers compiled by Jeffrey Beall was examined to determine the effect of their inclusion upon authors, and a possible bias against OA journals. Manually collected data from the publication archives of a sample of 250 journals from Beall publishers reveals a strong tendency towards a decline in their article output during 2012–2020. A comparison of the subset of 506 Beall journals indexed in Scopus with a benchmark set of other OA journals in Scopus with similar characteristics shows that Beall journals reveal as a group a strong decline in citation impact over the years, and reached an impact level far below that of their benchmarks. The Beall list of publishers was found to be heterogeneous in terms of bibliometric indicators but to be clearly differentiated from OA journals not included in the list. The same bibliometric comparison against comparable non‐OA journals reveal similar, but less marked, differences in citation and publication growth.

AB  - Digital technologies, combined with library expertise in information management and bibliographic control, access, dissemination and preservation, have provided new opportunities for academic libraries to play a more active role in the publication of scholarly information. Over the past decade a number of Australian academic libraries, drawing on early initiatives in North American libraries, have established electronic presses in their institutions. This article examines the motivations behind these initiatives and their similarities and differences, and identifies some of the ways in which library-led e-publishing may change the scholarly communication environment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Articles in open access (OA) journals can be published on a rolling basis, as they become ready, or in complete, discrete issues. This study examines the prevalence of and reasons for rolling volumes vs. discrete issues among scholarly OA library and information science (LIS) journals based in the United States. METHODS A survey was distributed to journal editors, asking them about their publication model and their reasons for and satisfaction with that model. RESULTS Of the 21 responding journals, 12 publish in discrete issues, eight publish in rolling volumes, and one publishes in rolling volumes with an occasional special issue. Almost all editors, regardless of model, cited ease of workflow as a justification for their chosen publication model, suggesting that there is no single best workflow for all journals. However, while all rolling-volume editors reported being satisfied with their model, satisfaction was less universal among discrete-issue editors. DISCUSSION The unexpectedly high number of rolling-volume journals suggests that LIS journal editors are making forward-looking choices about publication models even though the topic has not been much addressed in the library literature. Further research is warranted; possibilities include expanding the study’s geographic scope, broadening the study to other disciplines, and investigating publication model trends across the entire scholarly OA universe. CONCLUSION Both because satisfaction is high among editors of rolling-volume journals and because readers and authors appreciate quick publication times, the rolling-volume model will likely become even more prevalent in coming years.

AB  - Abstract Editors are journals’ entrepreneurs, managers, and stewards. They have the duty of holding high standards of scholarly quality in terms of end product (articles) and due process (adequate peer-review procedures). Given the importance of journals in the contemporary science “ecosystem,” editors emerge as decisive power brokers. Elite board members are scrutinizers but, paradoxically, they are themselves seldom subject to systematic study. This paper presents a comprehensive portrait of the editorship phenomenon in Innovation Studies by probing the structural features of the boards of 20 leading innovation-oriented journals as of 2019 and conducting an editor survey. We account for 2,440 individual editors in 3,005 different roles based in 53 countries. We uncover the overwhelming dominance of U.S.-affiliated editors and the contrasting rare presence of scholars from the Global South. The gender balance tilts toward men, with a weight above 60%. Enhanced journal achievement is associated with editors on multiple boards, diverse national representation, and increased women on boards. Almost 20% of scholars serve on multiple boards, and no single journal is free from this interlocking editorship phenomenon. The journal Research Policy is the most central in the cross-board network, followed by Industrial and Corporate Change. Finally, the implications of editormetrics for journal governance are discussed.

AB  - Paper journals, conferences and workshops have been the major media for scholarly discourse for 300 years. However, in the 1990s access to low-cost personal computing and Internet communications is leading to radical changes in the operation of scholarly communities. Electronic publication and conferencing is becoming common in all disciplines using commonly available Internet facilities such as ftp archives, list servers, gopher and world-wide web. Some scholarly communities that had not previously achieved a critical mass have done so through the net, others have launched major collaborative projects managed through the net, and others are questioning the value of conventional conferences that are limited by being localized in space and time compared with the flexibility of continuous international electronic conferencing through the web. However, the majority of current electronic scholarly discourse emulates paper-based media in relying primarily on text and diagrams for knowledge communication. It is beginning to take advantage of some of the multimedia capabilities of electronic publishing for color diagrams, pictures, movies and sound. Hypertext and hypermedia capabilities are being used to develop webs of linked material. Concept maps and formal knowledge structures are being used to provide a framework for knowledge expression, interchange and collaborative development. This article focuses on the extension of current documentation technologies to provide knowledge-level support for scholarly communities.

AB  - Background Despite having a crucial role in scholarly publishing, peer reviewers do not typically require any training. The purpose of this study was to conduct an international survey on the current perceptions and motivations of researchers regarding peer review training. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted of biomedical researchers. A total of 2000 corresponding authors from 100 randomly selected medical journals were invited via email. Quantitative items were reported using frequencies and percentages or means and SE, as appropriate. A thematic content analysis was conducted for qualitative items in which two researchers independently assigned codes to the responses for each written-text question, and subsequently grouped the codes into themes. A descriptive definition of each category was then created and unique themes–as well as the number and frequency of codes within each theme–were reported. Results A total of 186 participants completed the survey of which 14 were excluded. The majority of participants indicated they were men (n = 97 of 170, 57.1%), independent researchers (n = 108 of 172, 62.8%), and primarily affiliated with an academic organization (n = 103 of 170, 62.8%). A total of 144 of 171 participants (84.2%) indicated they had never received formal training in peer review. Most participants (n = 128, 75.7%) agreed–of which 41 (32.0%) agreed strongly–that peer reviewers should receive formal training in peer review prior to acting as a peer reviewer. The most preferred training formats were online courses, online lectures, and online modules. Most respondents (n = 111 of 147, 75.5%) stated that difficulty finding and/or accessing training was a barrier to completing training in peer review. Conclusion Despite being desired, most biomedical researchers have not received formal training in peer review and indicated that training was difficult to access or not available.

AB  - As open access to research information grows and publisher business models adapt accordingly, knowledge infrastructure has become the new frontier for advocates of open science. This paper argues that the time has come for universities and other knowledge institutions to assume a larger role in mitigating the risks that arise from ongoing consolidation in research infrastructure, including the privatization of community platforms, commercial control of analytics solutions, and other market-driven trends in scientific and scholarly publishing.

AB  - ABSTRACT The trend through which academia finances scientific publication has been changed into open access publishing, the latter is exploited by predatory journals and publishers. The aim of this paper is to review the current situation of predatory publishing and introduce Kscien's list of predatory journals and publishers. Kscien has recruited a special committee consisting of 23 young researchers. They are working unceasingly to keep the list refurbished, expose current tricks invented by the predators and guide authors. The list is designed to be updated daily. Currently, the criteria used to recognize predatory journals and publishers basically depend on the journal's misconduct, fabrication and inadequate peer review. Researches are ongoing to recapitulate more solid criteria with objective evidence to overcome the critics faced by Beall. Kscien's list has been proposed to replace the vanished Beall's list from the interior of the drawn region in fake journals and publishers. Highlights:

AB  - The paper aims to explore and identify the recent contributions to the literature available in the current developments and issues in licensing and pricing models in e-resources. An extensive literature survey was performed in an attempt to identify substantial works published to date concerning pricing and licensing issues coupled with the publishers and librarians. The literature review connotes that hardly any systematic study or scholarly output which can facilitate the precise and accurate facts about pricing and licensing issues coupled with the publishers and librarians is available, although the size of the scholarly publishing industry and its effect on the cost and licensing of e-resource is quite large.&nbsp;It is evident from the scrutiny of literature existing that there are still areas for advanced exploration on the topic of pricing and licensing concerns of the scholarly publishing industry; and study paves the way for the concerned organizations and institutions (such as Libraries and Publishers), at global level, to take substantial measures to overcome monopoly effects from the publishers and come up with the standard models. The study is very helpful for librarians or authorities in selecting the best available e-journal package for their libraries .The paper is the first ordered and thorough attempt to review the literature and provide that there is not any standard pricing model available for e-resource subscription in the market to control the monopoly of publishers and aggregators. &nbsp; Key words: Pricing, e-resources, pay per article, big deal, print, publishers, vendors.

AB  - This paper extends the scholarship on gender and scientific authorship by exploring women's involvement in editorial decision-making. Prior to 1945, women scientists could submit their work to the journals of the Royal Society, but they were excluded from all editorial and evaluation roles: such gate-keeping roles were reserved for Fellows of the Society. We draw upon the Society's archive to examine the experiences of female authors, referees, and communicators in the period after women were admitted to the Fellowship. We investigate the involvement of women in both anonymous roles (e.g. as referees), and in publicly visible positions of editorial responsibility (e.g. as communicators, and committee chairs). We reveal that women were better represented in both types of roles in the 1950s than in the 1970s and 1980s. These findings are pertinent to current debates about bias in the peer-review system, and the gendering of academic reward and recognition structures.

AB  - It is widely known now that scholarly communication is in crisis, resting on an academic publishing model that is unsustainable. One response to this crisis has been the emergence of Open Access (OA) publishing, bringing scholarly literature out from behind a paywall and making it freely available to anyone online. Many research and academic libraries are facilitating the change to OA by establishing institutional repositories, supporting OA policies, and hosting OA journals. In addition, research funding bodies, such as the Australian Research Council (ARC), are mandating that all published grant research outputs be made available in OA, unless legal and contractual obligations prevent this. Despite these broader changes, not all scholars are aware of the new publishing environment. In particular, the rate of adoption of OA models in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) has historically been lower than Science, Technology and Medicine (STM) disciplines. Nevertheless, some local and international OA exemplars exist in HSS. At Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, the faculty-administered environmental humanities journal, Landscapes, was migrated to the institutional open access repository in 2013. Subsequently, researchers in the Faculty of Education and Arts were surveyed regarding their knowledge, understandings, and perceptions of OA publishing. The survey was also designed to elicit the barriers to OA publishing perceived or experienced by HSS researchers. This article will present the findings of our small faculty-based OA survey, with particular attention to HSS academics (and within this subject group, particular attention to the arts and humanities), their perceptions of OA, and the impediments they encounter. We argue that OA publishing will continue to transform scholarship within the arts and humanities, especially through the role of institutional repositories. The “library-as-publisher” role offers the potential to transform academic and university-specific publishing activities. However, the ongoing training of university researchers and personnel is required to bring into balance their understandings of OA publisher and the demands of the broader Australian and international research environment.

AB  - The AI hype cycle has come for scholarly publishing. This essay argues that the industry’s feverishーif mostly aspirationalーembrace of artificial intelligence should be read as the latest installment of an ongoing campaign. Led by Elsevier, commercial publishers have, for about a decade, layered a second business on top of their legacy publishing operations. That business is to mine and process scholars’ works and behavior into prediction products, sold back to universities and research agencies. This article focuses on an offshoot of the big firms’ surveillance-publishing businesses: the post-ChatGPT imperative to profit from troves of proprietary “training data,” to make new AI products andーthe essay predictsーto license academic papers and scholars’ tracked behavior to big technology companies. The article points to the potential knowledge effects of AI models in academia: Products and models are poised to serve as knowledge arbitrators, by picking winners and losers according to what they makevisible. I also cite potential knock-on effects, including incentives for publishers to roll back open access (OA) and new restrictions on researchers’ access to the open web. The article concludes with a call for a coordinated campaign of advocacy and consciousness-raising, paired with high-quality, in-depth studies of publisher data harvestingーbuilt on the premise that another scholarly-publishing world is possible. There are many good reasons to restore custody to the academy, the essay argues. The latest is to stop our work from fueling the publishers’ AI profits.

AB  - This investigation explores scholarly communication business models in American Library Association (ALA) division peer-reviewed academic journals. Previous studies reveal the numerous issues organizations and publishers face in the academic publishing environment. Through an analysis of documented procedures, policies, and finances of five ALA division journals, we compare business and access models. We conclude that some ALA divisions prioritize the costs associated with changing business models, including hard-to-estimate costs such as the labor of volunteers. For other divisions, the financial aspects are less important than maintaining core values, such as those defined in ALA’s Core Values in Librarianship.

AB  - While learning analytics (LA) has been highlighted as a field aiming to address systemic equity and quality issues within educational systems between and within regions, to date, its adoption is predominantly in the Global North. Since the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) aspires to be international in reach and relevance, and to increase the diversity and inclusivity of the SoLAR community, it is pertinent to look at learning analytics use in higher education institutions in Africa. This paper reports the first scoping review of research in the field of LA conducted on the African continent. The coding and analysis show that LA research is still in its infancy on the African continent with only 15 studies, overwhelmingly from South Africa. The study also revealed several challenges, such as limited technical support and access to LMSs, the limited visibility of African scholars at SoLAR events and publication venues, and the limited focus on interventions that involve stakeholders. The article concludes with several propositions and provocations to advance the adoption of LA in Africa and open up space for critical conversations about the potential of learning analytics in contexts with characteristics different than those found in the Global North.

AB  - Scholarly PublishingHow do we gauge the importance of a scientific publication? Citation counts are, by their nature, crowdsourced, but their inherent meaning is somewhat unclear. To explore this question in more depth, Borchardt et al. asked chemists in a survey to look back at a 10-year-old issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society ( JACS ) and predict, without checking, which three papers had been most highly cited. Respondents were also asked which papers they construed as most important and which they would share with other chemists or the public more broadly. Citations not only proved rather hard to predict, but also correlated poorly with the papers chosen to share.PLOS ONE 13 , e0194903 (2018).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to better understand the theory and practice of peer review in open-access mega-journals (OAMJs). OAMJs typically operate a “soundness-only” review policy aiming to evaluate only the rigour of an article, not the novelty or significance of the research or its relevance to a particular community, with these elements being left for “the community to decide” post-publication. Design/methodology/approach The paper reports the results of interviews with 31 senior publishers and editors representing 16 different organisations, including 10 that publish an OAMJ. Thematic analysis was carried out on the data and an analytical model developed to explicate their significance. Findings Findings suggest that in reality criteria beyond technical or scientific soundness can and do influence editorial decisions. Deviations from the original OAMJ model are both publisher supported (in the form of requirements for an article to be “worthy” of publication) and practice driven (in the form of some reviewers and editors applying traditional peer review criteria to OAMJ submissions). Also publishers believe post-publication evaluation of novelty, significance and relevance remains problematic. Originality/value The study is based on unprecedented access to senior publishers and editors, allowing insight into their strategic and operational priorities. The paper is the first to report in-depth qualitative data relating specifically to soundness-only peer review for OAMJs, shedding new light on the OAMJ phenomenon and helping inform discussion on its future role in scholarly communication. The paper proposes a new model for understanding the OAMJ approach to quality assurance, and how it is different from traditional peer review.

AB  - While Internet technologies have provided social networks for researchers as more open means to make their work available to other scholars, the traditionally closed, peer review-based publishing process has remained nearly untouched. We ask researchers about their intention to go one step further and use social peer review (SPR), which enables them to directly publish their work within a web-based social network, where, instead of the traditional pre-publication peer review, it can be evaluated and critiqued by the entire academic community. Based on a sample of 1429 international scholars from various fields and by drawing upon adoption and institutional theory, this study seeks to identify scientists' motivational drivers for engaging in this new forms of scholarly communication. We find that the adoption of SPR is driven more by extrinsic factors than by researchers' intrinsic motivation or normative influences to make science more open. Further challenges for SPR are low scores on the most relevant performance criteria, as well as low acceptance by established scientists. However, rather than a substitute, SPR is well perceived as a possible supplement to the traditional peer-based review system.

AB  - This paper addresses the integration of a Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) service within a group of open access (OA) publishing digital platforms and considers its potential impact on both research and scholarly publishing. The software powering this service, called entity-fishing, was initially developed by Inria in the context of the EU FP7 project CENDARI and provides automatic entity recognition and disambiguation using the Wikipedia and Wikidata data sets. The application is distributed with an open-source licence, and it has been deployed as a web service in DARIAH's infrastructure hosted by the French HumaNum. In the paper, we focus on the specific issues related to its integration on five OA platforms specialized in the publication of scholarly monographs in the social sciences and humanities (SSH), as part of the work carried out within the EU H2020 project HIRMEOS (High Integration of Research Monographs in the European Open Science infrastructure). In the first section, we give a brief overview of the current status and evolution of OA publications, considering specifically the challenges that OA monographs are encountering. In the second part, we show how the HIRMEOS project aims to face these challenges by optimizing five OA digital platforms for the publication of monographs from the SSH and ensuring their interoperability. In sections three and four we give a comprehensive description of the entity-fishing service, focusing on its concrete applications in real use cases together with some further possible ideas on how to exploit the annotations generated. We show that entity-fishing annotations can improve both research and publishing process. In the last chapter, we briefly present further possible application scenarios that could be made available through infrastructural projects.

Library &amp; Information Science Research, 39(1), 8-15. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2017.01.002 Abstract Objective – To compare the characteristics of authors publishing in open access and non-open access library and information science (LIS) journals. Design – Comparative analysis of published journal articles. Setting – Academic journals. Subjects – Articles published in selected LIS journals between 2008-2013. Methods – Journals included in the Library Science and Information Science category in the 2012 edition of Journal Citation Reports and those listed in the Library and Information Science category of the Directory of Open Access Journals as of May 2013 were included in the analysis. Articles were examined and coded for author occupation, academic rank, and type of collaboration. Main Results – The author analyzed 1,807 articles from 20 open access journals and 1,665 articles from 13 non-open access journals. An unknown number of articles were excluded because they lacked required author information. Over half (53.9%) of the authors who published in the open access journals were practitioners. Over half (58.1%) of the authors who published in the non-open access journals were academics. Librarian-librarian collaboration was the most common type (38.6%) of collaboration found in the open access journals. Academic-academic collaboration was the most common type (34.1%) of collaboration found in the non-open access journals. Collaboration between librarians and academics was seen in 20.5% of open access articles and 13.2% of non-open access articles. Conclusion – In general, librarian-authored research was found more often in open access journals, while the “latest research topics and ideas” (p. 14) were found most often in non-open access journals.

AB  - As the costs of scholarly and educational publications skyrocket, open educational resources (OER) are becoming an important way to provide content and enhance the teaching and learning experience. Librarians have a key role to play in developing, advocating, and managing OER. For many librarians, however, championing OERs means adding an additional responsibility to their already heavy workloads, which may be overwhelming. This article describes how a grassroots group of academic librarians in British Columbia, Canada joined together as a community of practice to learn and to share ideas, strategies, and tools to support the use of OER. The BCOER Librarians focus on the education and professional development of librarians to help facilitate the use and development of OERs and to create authoritative and sustainable resources to support librarians in OER-related interactions with faculty.

AB  - This study aims to determine the librarian's understanding of data repository which include benefits, engagement of librarians in repository management, and repository implementation. The study has surveyed librarians at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences located in Jakarta, Bogor, Cibinong, and Serpong by distributing 45 questionnaires, but only 36 returned. The data were tabulated and analyzed using graphs/diagrams. The respondents of the study were female (61.1%) and male (38.9%). The education background of the respondents was undergraduate (50%), the most working period is between 20-30 years (38.9%), and the most work locations were in Jakarta (70.6%). The study showed that respondents with an undergraduate background and those who work in Jakarta have the highest understanding of the repository (69%). The most involved in repository management were those with bachelor's degrees and working in Jakarta (52%). Respondents who were involved in the socialization of the data repository were 47%, and those who were not involved were 44%. As many as 44% of respondents stated that the data repository has been implemented, and the remaining 56% said it has not been implemented. In conclusion, most respondents understand the data repository, especially those with a bachelor's degree, and were working in Jakarta. The data repository has not been implemented properly due to lack of outreach to researchers and their low trust in the data repository.

TI  - Librarians and University Presses of the World Unite!: Efforts to Resuscitate the Knowledge Commons of Academic Publishing
AU  - Peekhaus, Wilhelm
C1  - School of Information Studies, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
AB  - Introduction As is relatively well known, Henry Oldenburg, the first Joint Secretary of the then newly founded Royal Society of London, published in 1665 the world's first scholarly journal, Philosophical Transactions. Oldenburg established the journal to fulfill four functions that continue today as part of the scholarly communication process: registration, which ensures the article is connected to the author as well as the intellectual property right holder; certification of the quality of the research through peer review; dissemination of the research; and archiving to ensure historical preservation and future availability of research. The scholarly publishing system remained confined largely to learned societies for roughly the following three centuries, until commercial publishers began to recognize and exploit the profit potential of academic literature. Sustained annual growth in the number of journals and articles, accompanied by aggressive merger and acquisition activity among the major publishing conglomerates, has resulted in a contemporary multi-billion dollar industry dominated by a handful of publishing behemoths that extract immense resources from institutions of higher education based on the free labour of academics. And while the largest of the commercial publishers that now dominate the academic publishing ecosystem declare that they are vital to ensuring the effective discharge of the key aspects of the scholarly communication system, the proposed paper will suggest that their command and extreme rent-seeking behavior is parasitic on scholarly communication and ultimately stymies the system. Moreover, and this is the more novel element of the argument to be developed, this stranglehold is superfluous and could be loosened in a way that would restore substantial control over the academic journal publishing system to stakeholders and institutions more closely aligned with the interests of the actual producers and users of scholarly works. Considered in broad brush strokes, the paper will argue that contemporary information and communication techologies, in tandem with open source digital publishing management platforms, have made it technologically, logistically, and financially feasible for scholarly journal publishing to be reclaimed by members of the academy through their non-profit university presses and libraries in ways that would respond to the serials crisis experienced by academic libraries while ensuring fidelity to the traditional processes of the scholarly communication system. A General Overview of the Western Academic Publishing Industry According to the most recent data collected by the consulting firm Outsell, revenues in 2011 for the science-publishing industry amounted to US$9.4 billion. Based on 1.8 million English-language articles published annually by 3,500 publishers in 27,000 journals, this figure translates into gross revenue of slightly more than US$5,200 per article [as cited in 1].i The academic publishing industry is now dominated by ten major corporations. The top three publishers of scientific journals (Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley-Blackwell) account for approximately 42 percent of all articles published. In part, this concentrated degree of control has been made possible because these large commercial publishers have been very successful in acquiring many of the most prestigious and high-circulation journals across almost all academic disciplines. In an attempt to justify the high rents they extract when selling access to the knowledge created by academic labourers, publishers typically invoke claims about adding value to the broader knowledge ecology. Such assertions completely sidestep the reality that unpaid academic labour provides the content, peer-review, and editorial work (although a few publishers pay editors a small stipend, it is typically well below the true value of the person's efforts) being appropriated by journal publishers. These types of claims also occlude the additional time and money burdens typically downloaded onto authors should their manuscript contain colour material, or require copyright release for images and other copyrighted material they might want to incorporate into their work. And even this value-added work is appropriated by publishers who coerce authors into surrendering their intellectual property rights as a precondition for publication. Open Access Responses In response to several of the trends in the academic publishing industry that have clearly disadvantaged both authors and libraries – that is, the producers and the purchasers of scholarly output – a sustained movement has emerged over the last decade and a half that advocates for and develops open-access models to academic research. The two dominant accepted models for delivering open access to scholarly works are known as 'Gold' and 'Green' open access. Gold open access refers to peer-reviewed publication in an open-access journal, whereas Green open access involves deposit of the work in an institutional or subject electronic repository. Beyond the mounting success of the Green model that relies on repositories, recent research provides additional evidence that open-access journal publishing has matured into a sustainable form of scholarly publication [2]. As might also be expected given such monumental growth, open-access infrastructure and technical applications have advanced considerably. In particular, Open Journal Systems, a journal management and publishing system developed by the Public Knowledge Project, has become a widely used software platform by over 5,800 open-access journals. Unfortunately, the corporate publishing oligarchs have also recognized the capital accumulation opportunities offered by open-access models. All of the leading corporate academic publishers now offer Green and Gold open-access options at a range of different, and exorbitant, price points (e.g., depending on the publisher and the journal, Green open-access options can be purchased for US$1,500 and Gold open access tends to run between US$2,000 and US$3,000). The fact that there is such a range of article processing charges indicates that they are less a reflection of actual production costs and instead based more on a calculus of what the market will bear. Clearly, open access per se will not necessarily improve the long-term financial sustainability of the scholarly communication system. Instead, these corporate adaptations to open access represent a direct response by commercial publishers to subvert the open-access model in service of their own accumulation imperatives. Indeed, according to analysts at Bernstein Research, which upgraded its stock outlook for Reed Elsevier in September 2014 to market-perform from underperform in 2011, open access has done little to challenge the market strength of the leading subscription publishers. Instead, these analysts suggest that open-access funding models may actually be contributing to the profits of scientific, technical, and medical (STM) journal publishers. This assessment has certainly been borne out in the case of Elsevier, which has been steadily increasing its operating profit margins over the last few years for its STM journals: 36 percent (£724 million) in 2010, 37 percent (£768 million) in 2011, 38 percent (£780 million) in 2012, and 39 percent (£826 million) in 2013. These same analysts predict further consolidation of the industry, which would favour the larger players such as Elsevier [3]. Toward a More Substantive Transformation of the Scholarly Publishing System All academics, but especially tenured faculty, need to be reminded of their role in the broader knowledge ecology and the constraining effects that the current commercial model of journal publishing exercises on this ecology. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is critical since academics benefit from their work being widely disseminated and used (and hopefully cited), not from royalty streams. Put more directly, there is a disconnect between the factors motivating the typical academic writer and the profit maximising behaviour of commercial publishers. Academics provide the majority of labour that sustains the production of scholarly knowledge, including the actual research and writing, peer review, and editing. It is time for academics to re-appropriate from for-profit publishers the products and processes of our collective labour in order to revitalise the knowledge commons in ways that serve the public good rather than commercial accumulation imperatives. And although this might require significant amounts of persuasion among some of our more conservative colleagues, I suggest that logistically such a re-appropriation would be less difficult. There already exists a basic publishing infrastructure in the form of non-profit university presses, which should be able to substitute easily for commercial publishers in ways that would not require the assignment of copyright by authors or the imposition of onerous pricing and licensing contracts on library customers. Indeed, university presses have substantial historical experience in facilitating the dissemination of scholarly research across multiple product lines (trade books, scholarly monographs, textbooks, and journals). And, as pointed out above, there exist freely available, technologically sophisticated digital publishing platforms (e.g., Open Journal Systems) of which university presses could avail themselves. I therefore believe that university presses are best positioned to fulfill the key aspects of the scholarly communication system in ways that would promote access while also remedying the fiscal instability of the current corporate-dominated model. Moreover, and this is the part of the paper that will be further elaborated for the conference, university presses can partner with the increasing number of university libraries that have coalesced through the Library Publishing Coalition project. This group of 60 North American academic libraries has committed itself to expanding the nascent field of library publishing in collaboration with university presses and learned societies. The findings reported in this part of the paper will outline some of the lessons and best practices learned so far by this group of librarians who are actively seeking to collaboratively transform academic publishing into a commonist endeavour better aligned with the production processes and consumption practices of the actual producers and consumers of academic research. Conclusions Commercial control of academic publishing through strategies and practices such as industry consolidation and forced assignment of copyright represents an appropriation and enclosure of the knowledge commons that otherwise would emerge from the unrestricted flow of academic research. Put another way, commercial control of academic publishing expedites the private expropriation of much of the value that is produced in common through the cooperative relationships inherent in scholarly production. Yet such appropriation and enclosure need not be tolerated. The success of the open-access movement and models has demonstrated that there are viable alternatives to the commercial control of academic publishing. However, the dominant open-access regime suffers from inherent neutrality in respect of economic model that renders it susceptible to commercial appropriation and exploitation. The author-pay model does nothing to destruct the commodity logic of academic publishing but instead merely transfers the revenue source from users/readers to the actual producers (authors), which introduces yet another level of exploitation of the producers. Thus, while sympathetic to the goals and objectives of (Gold) open access, I assert that the more formidable imbalance in the scholarly publishing system is the presence and substantial control exercised by for-profit publishers. I therefore believe that we need to become more radical in our thinking and our actions in order to wrest control of academic publishing from the current commercial publishing oligarchs. A group of academic librarians, through their institutions, has begun to try and actively re-appropriate such control. The review and assessment of selected examples of collaborative publishing projects being undertaken by some university presses and academic libraries shines an optimistic light on efforts to exert autonomous self-control over our knowledge commons.

AB  - Abstract Open scholarship is a major reform movement within research. This paper seeks to understand how open scholarship might address the challenges faced by research in Africa, through a study based on a participatory collaborative workshop to create a partnership with librarians in Rwanda. The literature review identifies three broad perspectives on the apparent under-performance of Rwandan research: one locating the issue in the unequal scholarly communications system, a second pointing to a country deficit and a third blaming cognitive injustices. The Rwandan librarians see researchers as challenged through the pressures on them to publish, the costs of research, poor infrastructure, lack of skills and limited access to literature. Collectively these challenges constitute a critical barrier to research. These limits fit largely the country deficit perspective. Open scholarship as conceived in the Global North is only a small part of the answer to the challenges faced by Rwandan scholars. To promote equity, notions of open scholarship need to take into account the conditions under which research is conducted in less privileged contexts such as Rwanda.

AB  - The rapid change in scholarly communication and knowledge management has transformed the repository services and imposed new skills and competencies for repository management. This study is posed to assess the skills and competencies of librarians for repository management and scholarly communication in academic institutions in Nigeria. The study adopted a survey research design to assess the skills and competencies of the librarians using NASIG “Core Competencies for Scholarly Communication Librarians 2017”. The sample size of the study comprises 120 librarians across 40 institutions. The findings of the study indicate among others that; 74 % of the librarians have a general understanding of repository platforms, 54.17% background knowledge of open access movement, and 58% experience in advocacy for open access. At the same time, 83.3% of the librarians can capture, store, and preserve the research output. While 62.3% understand research impact, only 35.8% understand emerging alternatives measures of the impact. Although, 73.1 % understand Data description and storage, only 20.8% understand text and data mining. The study concluded that awareness, skills, and competencies of the librarians is increasing and recommends among others; setting up a framework for the employment of repository and scholarly communication librarians and training on repository management and scholarly communication.

AB  - As the budget increases of the post-World War II era that favoured science and education were being rolled back in the 1970s, information and communicational technological (ICT) development began to be rolled out. Research libraries responded by developing data systems and expertise that led eventually to new services such as institutional repositories and journal hosting. Twenty years later, continued ICT development encouraged entrepreneurship in digital journal publishing among a variety of scholars in Canada and elsewhere. Globally, public and private sector funded digital projects emerged aimed at regime change in the circulation of research knowledge. These dramatic developments are noteworthy for themselves as well as in recognition of valuable library/researcher partnerships that leave content to scholars and administration to libraries. On the whole, these partnerships have not been extended to university press-based monograph publishing with the presses joining as a third partner. Instead calls for reorganization verge on subordinating university presses to institutional mandates that could well diminish freedom of inquiry. A three-way partnership among scholars, libraries and publishing professionals has much to recommend it. Such a partnership, cast as constructivist inquiry, or social science and humanities R&amp;D, would encourage extensive public sector participation scholarly publishing and open a long-overdue dynamic into the social science and humanities research.

AB  - Researchers from Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC) surveyed faculty members from 10 academic research libraries to learn about scholarly publishing activities, attitudes, and policies. Areas of special interest included the effect of publishers' intellectual property policies and institutional promotion and tenure processes on library faculty publishing decisions. The library faculty members were also asked about their experience in negotiating for additional rights from publishers and their experience in self-archiving their research. The researchers wanted to determine if there were any correlation between a library faculty member's rank and tenure status and the number of peer-reviewed articles published in refereed journals.

AB  - As main buyers of scholarly literature, research libraries have always provided essential economic support for sustaining the market of academic publishing. With the switch to open access (OA), libraries are now faced with transitioning this support from the demand (subscriptions) to the supply (publications) side. The way in which this is currently done, in general, risks strengthening the preponderance of the for-profit approach to scholarly communication. We therefore believe that it is essential to apply library budgets to foster a greater diversity. That is exactly the purpose of the Fund for Fair Open Access, set up by KU Leuven Libraries in 2018, which is exclusively devoted to stimulating the development of non-profit and community-led initiatives. This is achieved by library memberships to sustain open scholarship infrastructure, by supporting diamond OA programmes and by subsidizing OA books published by Leuven University Press. In this article, we will demonstrate the accomplished successes of the fund and share some insights we have gathered along the way, such as our decision to cease financing article processing charges, even in a Fair OA business model.

AB  - BACKGROUND The University of Arizona Press moved under the University of Arizona Library both physically and administratively a few years ago, echoing a trend amongst university presses: 20 AAUP members now are under the administration of university libraries. To understand the new evolving relationships in scholarly communication, a review of university press and library collaborations was undertaken by the University of Arizona Press and the University of Arizona Library through the Association of Research Libraries Career Enhancement Program (ARL CEP). LITERATURE REVIEW There has been much written throughout the years on both the acrimonious and collaborative relationships between university presses and academic libraries. Much of the literature includes either editorials or case studies, with one or two major reviews of scholarly communications and the state of publishing. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT During the course of nine weeks, the ARL CEP Fellow reviewed existing literature, interviewed staff at the University of Arizona Press and Library, and conducted 27 informal interviews with library deans, press directors, and scholarly communications leaders. The interviews addressed the partnership history, structure, motivations, goals and needs, administrative support and budget decisions, key stakeholders, and thoughts on the future of their relationships as well as scholarly communications. Then University of Arizona Library and Press staff were interviewed regarding their perceptions of their roles and each other’s roles. NEXT STEPS This research report includes findings from the literature review and interviews as well as specific recommendations for the University of Arizona that will be implemented to improve and build relationships going forward.

AB  - The Library Publishing Coalition (LPC) defines library publishing as the “creation, dissemination, and curation of scholarly, creative, and/or educational works” by college and university libraries. While providing a publishing platform, hosting, and services for editorial teams is key to any library publishing initiative, library publishing is also centered on furthering core library values. Thus library publishing activities are mission-driven, centered on education, and focused on finding and promoting sustainable approaches to open access publishing and building cooperative open infrastructure.

AB  - In 2007, 65% of ARL members were reported to be either offering or developing publishing services (Hahn, 2008). A new survey, conducted by Purdue University, Georgia Tech, and University of Utah Libraries as part of an IMLS-funded research project, suggests that almost 80% of ARL members are now offering publishing services and that this is also an active area of interest in Oberlin Group (liberal arts college) and medium-sized institutions. It also provides a richer picture of an increasingly mature area of academic library service provision, well aligned with issues of emerging roles and new models of scholarly communication. This session reports on this important year-long research project surveying the state of "library publishing services" in 2011 and examines the challenges and opportunities library publishers face in the areas of technological infrastructure, skills and processes, and organization and sustainability. Attendees can expect to: learn about the opportunities of becoming involved in providing publishing services from within the library; get practical tips on growing existing programs from librarians active in this space; and receive some honest assessments of the challenges institutions involved in this area of new entrepreneurship have faced and how they have overcome them.

AB  - University libraries worldwide are reconceptualising the ways in which they support the research agenda in their respective institutions. This paper is based on a survey completed by member libraries of the Queensland University Libraries Office of Cooperation (QUL OC), the findings of which may be informative for other university libraries. After briefly examining major emerging trends in research support, the paper discusses the results of the survey specifically focussing on support for researchers and the research agenda in their institutions. All responding libraries offer a high level of research support, however, eResearch support, in general, and research data management support, in particular, have the highest variance among the libraries, and signal possible areas for growth. Areas for follow-up, benchmarking and development are suggested.

AB  - Abstract&#x0D; Objective – This study analyzes scholarly publications supported by library open access funds, including author demographics, journal trends, and article impact. It also identifies and summarizes open access fund criteria and viability. The goal is to better understand the sustainability of open access funds, as well as identify potential best practices for institutions with open access funds.&#x0D; Methods – Publication data was solicited from universities with open access (OA) funds, and supplemented with publication and author metrics, including Journal Impact Factor, Altmetric Attention Score, and author h-index. Additionally, data was collected from OA fund websites, including fund criteria and guidelines.&#x0D; Results – Library OA funds tend to support faculty in science and medical fields. Impact varied widely, especially between disciplines, but a limited measurement indicated an overall smaller relative impact of publications funded by library OA funds. Many open access funds operate using similar criteria related to author and publication eligibility, which seem to be largely successful at avoiding the funding of articles published in predatory journals.&#x0D; Conclusions – Libraries have successfully funded many publications using criteria that could constitute best practices in this area. However, institutions with OA funds may need to identify opportunities to increase support for high-impact publications, as well as consider the financial stability of these funds. Alternative models for OA support are discussed in the context of an ever-changing open access landscape.

AB  - Abstract In this paper we investigate the definitions of perpetual access and examine current studies on the attitudes and concerns towards perpetual access from both libraries and publishers separately. We then conduct a content analysis of 72 e-journal licenses to explore whether perpetual access clauses vary among commercial publishers and non-commercial publishers, whether clauses change over time, and whether differences exist between consortium and site licenses. Results suggest that different perpetual access clauses may be at different stages of institutionalization. Perpetual access clauses that are more institutionalized include: addressing perpetual access in license, providing perpetual access upon expiry of subscription, and specifying a location for perpetual access.

AB  - Abstract We report the outcomes of BioMed Central’s public consultation on implementing open data-compliant licensing in peer-reviewed open access journals. Respondents (42) to the 2012 consultation were six to one in favor (29 in support; 5 against; 8 abstentions) of changing our authors’ default open access copyright license agreement, to introduce the Creative Commons CC0 public domain waiver for data published in BioMed Central’s journals. We summarize the different questions we received in response to the consultation and our responses to them – matters such as citation, plagiarism, patient privacy, and commercial use were raised. In light of the support for open data in our journals we outline our plans to implement, in September 2013, a combined Creative Commons Attribution license for published articles (papers) and Creative Commons CC0 waiver for published data.

AB  - Abstract Lists of endorsed and discouraged scholarly publications recently emerged as an important transition in Chinese journal evaluation. Among the targeted users of these lists are researchers, who are to avoid publishing in discouraged journals and focus efforts on endorsed journals. However, it is unclear how these lists affect researchers’ valuations when choosing publication outlets. This explorative study investigates the reception of such journal lists in Chinese scientists’ research practices. Our findings suggest that three logics interact in respondents’ journal valuations: institutional evaluation regimes, differing epistemic cultures, and the influence of the commercial publishing industry. The reactive effects of both endorsed and discouraged journal lists appear to differ with the ranking status of universities, the seniority of scholars, and research fields. Apart from the new institutional evaluation regimes in this interplay, there appear to be more predominant factors than journal lists that inform publishing choices: quantitative indicators, publishers’ branding, epistemic cultures, and editorial procedures and publishing models.

AB  - Computing technology has deeply shaped how academic articles are written and produced, yet article formats and affordances have changed little over centuries. The status quo consists of digital files optimized for printed paper—ill-suited to interactive reading aids, accessibility, dynamic figures, or easy information extraction and reuse. Guided by formative discussions with scholarly communication researchers and publishing tool developers, we present Living Papers, a language toolkit for producing augmented academic articles that span print, interactive, and computational media. Living Papers articles may include formatted text, references, executable code, and interactive components. Articles are parsed into a standardized document format from which a variety of outputs are generated, including static PDFs, dynamic web pages, and extraction APIs for paper content and metadata. We describe Living Papers' architecture, document model, and reactive runtime, and detail key aspects such as citation processing and conversion of interactive components to static content. We demonstrate the use and extension of Living Papers through examples spanning traditional research papers, explorable explanations, information extraction, and reading aids such as enhanced citations, cross-references, and equations. Living Papers is available as an extensible, open source platform intended to support both article authors and researchers of augmented reading and writing experiences.

AU  - Kling, Rob

AU  - McKim, Geoff
AB  - Many librarians and scholars believe that the Internet can be used to dramatically improve scholarly communication. During the last decade there has been substantial discussion of five major publishing models where readers could access articles without a fee: electronic journals, hybrid paper-electronic journals, authors' self-posting on web sites, free online access to all peer reviewed literature, and disciplinary repositories where authors post their own unrefereed articles. There have been numerous projects within each of these models, as well as extensive discussions about their strengths and limitations. While some of these projects have become important scholarly resources in specific disciplines; none of them has become commonplace across numerous disciplines. There is a sixth model that has been quietly adopted and developed in a number of disciplines – the research publication series called working papers or technical reports that are sponsored by academic departments or research institutes. Many of these manuscript series are available to readers, online, and free of charge. This model – which we call Guild Publishing – has a distinct set of advantages and limitations when compared with the other five publishing models. This article explains the Guild Publishing Model, provides some examples, and discusses its strengths and limitations.

AB  - To address challenges that learners, course creators, librarians and academics involved with OER and MOOCs are facing when looking for scholarly materials, Athabasca University Library has initiated the development of the Open Library at AU. This open library is a full library website that provides easy access to open and free resources. Tools and information literacy tutorials are also included to enable learners, researchers, and others to find, evaluate, and use the information they need for their open learning course or research. Many of the challenges that those involved in open learning face are addressed by the open library and the potential impact it can have on open learning and knowledge sharing is tremendous.

AB  - In 2020, LYRASIS Research conducted a member survey of predominantly United States (U.S.) higher education libraries to understand the spectrum of attitudes and actions related to Open Access (OA). The results indicated that the U.S. approach to OA is decentralised, lacking the focused trends that are apparent in other areas of the world. The diversity among types of colleges and universities in the U.S. is revealed through discussions about support or lack thereof for APCs, crowdfunding models, preprint repositories, the Subscribe to Open approach, and more. The array of OA approaches that garner support in the U.S. may appear confusing as we strive for scale in our efforts. LYRASIS has used its research findings, in combination with our deep understanding of U.S. higher education libraries, to develop a collaborative approach towards OA that provides multiple incentives and opportunities for libraries serving all types of institutions to engage. This article, expanding on the LIBER 2021 Conference Presentation of the same name, will outline the results of the survey, the conclusions LYRASIS has drawn, and our work to develop an inclusive approach to a variety of OA initiatives. Our understanding of the landscape of U.S. higher education has led us to develop or support several significant recent OA initiatives, including a fund for OA ebooks focused on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals topics and the establishment of the LYRASIS Open Access Community Investment Program (OACIP).

AB  - For more than 110 years, the raison d’etre of The Electrochemical Society has been the broad and effective dissemination of technical and scientific information through technical meetings and publications. Specifically, archival publications make available, to current and future generations, peer-reviewed advances in scientific and engineering fields within the scope of ECS. Many of these entities can benefit greatly from this content via online publication. Our intent is to provide the best quality and widest dissemination possible to our members and to the scientific/technological community at large. The radical changes in scholarly publishing venues made possible by the Internet, and recent advances in electronics technology, greatly expand the potential for wide availability of the content covered by ECS. Of immediate interest in this regard is the unrestricted access to scholarly work via the Internet referred to as Open Access (OA). Because professional societies serve authors, readers, and developers of scientific and technological content, we feel that ECS and other societies should lead the way in the establishment of low cost, effective, and efficient OA approaches. Toward that end, ECS has embarked on a quest to ultimately offer full OA (no charge to authors, readers, libraries, or institutional members) for our four peerreviewed journals. The first step toward this goal is the implementation of our Author Choice Open Access program, which began early this year. As the name implies, authors now have the choice of having their accepted papers published as Open Access articles. Because this intent represents a new paradigm for ECS, we must determine the appropriate business model to realize our goal. Details of the various possibilities are described in other articles in the spring 2014 issue of Interface (http://www.electrochem.org/dl/ interface/spr/spr14/if_spr14.htm) and on the ECS website (http:// www.electrochem.org/oa/).

AB  - When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind" Lord Kelvin, 1883 [1].Science is all about quantification.It is therefore somewhat ironic that the mechanism by which science is disseminatedacademic publishinghas yet to develop an acceptable way of measuring itself.Several fundamental issues regarding the scholarly publishing enterprise remain largely unresolved, such as how journal performance should be assessed, how journals should be compared and ranked, and how the impact of individual manuscripts should be evaluated.These issues are of relevance not only to journal editors and publishers, but also to librarians, who need to decide which journals to purchase, to researchers, who need to decide which journals to select for submission to, and to clinicians, who need to decide which journals they should read.By far the most widely used measure of journal performance is the Impact Factor, first developed by Eugene Garfield in 1955 as a means of selecting which journals to include in the Science Citations Index [2-4].The Impact Factor represents the average number of citations received per paper published in that journal during the two preceding years.For example, the Impact Factor of a journal in 2011 is calculated as follows

AU  - Horava, Tony
C1  - University of Ottawa
AB  - At the University of Ottawa, Canada, the UO Press and the UO Library have developed a strategic partnership to publish and disseminate selected new monographs as gold open access (OA). Starting in 2013, the Library agreed to fund three books at C$10,000 per book (a total of C$30,000 per year) in order to remove barriers to accessing scholarship and to align with scholarly communication goals of the University. In 2015 this agreement was renewed for another three years and the funding was increased to cover four books (a total of C$40,000 per year). Ten titles have so far been published under this model. The data reveals that there have been 12,629 downloads as well as 16,584 page views of these titles, as of September 2015. There have been over 4,700 copies (print and EPUB) sold in spite of the free availability of the PDF version. This program has been very successful in terms of increasing the visibility and impact of the Press’s publications; in providing unrestricted access to new scholarly research; and also in providing a significant source of revenue for the Press. The goals, process and outcomes are described in the context of the UO Press and the UO Library.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of one of the most important and controversial areas of scholarly communication: Open Access publishing and dissemination of research outputs. It identifies and discusses recent trends and future challenges for various stakeholders in delivering Open Access (OA) to the scholarly literature. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on a number of interrelated strands of evidence which make up the current discourse on OA, comprising the peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and other forms of communication (including blogs and e-mail discussion lists). It uses a large-scale textual analysis of the peer-reviewed literature since 2010 (carried out using the VOSviewer tool) as a basis for discussion of issues raised in the OA discourse. Findings – A number of key themes are identified, including the relationship between “Green” OA (deposit in repositories) and “Gold” OA (OA journal publication), the developing evidence base associated with OA, researcher attitudes and behaviours, policy directions, management of repositories, development of journals, institutional responses and issues around impact and scholarly communication futures. It suggests that current challenges now focus on how OA can be made to work in practice, having moved on from the discussion of whether it should happen at all. Originality/value – The paper provides a structured evidence-based review of major issues in the OA field, and suggests key areas for future research and policy development.

AB  - As open access gains a strong foothold in medical publishing, social science scholars increasingly are looking for outlets to make their own research open access. In STM, publication fees of the major open access journals start at $1,350, with payment often covered as part of grants received from pharmaceutical companies, government, and other organized entities. In contrast, limited grant funding in the social sciences doesn’t typically include publication support, so the question remains, “How can the open access model work for the social sciences?” This moderated panel discussion included representatives from libraries, university administration, and publishers to gain a full view of the current open access funding and publishing landscape and what might lie ahead. The conversation particularly focused on the librarian’s role in facilitating the open access funding and publishing processes and how the role of a social science librarian may change in an open access world.

AB  - Democratizing access to information is an enabler for our digital future. It can transform how knowledge is created, preserved, and shared, and strengthen the connection between academics and the communities they serve. Yet, open scholarship is influenced by history and politics. This article explores the foundations underlying open scholarship as a quest for more just, equitable, and inclusive societies. It analyzes the origins of the open scholarship movement and explores how systemic factors have impacted equality and equity of knowledge access and production according to location, nationality, race, age, gender, and socio-economic circumstances. It highlights how the privileges of the global North permeate academic and technical standards, norms, and infrastructures. It also reviews how the collective design of more open and collaborative networks can engage a richer diversity of communities, enabling greater social inclusion, and presents key examples. By fostering dialogue with multiple stakeholders, more effective avenues for knowledge production and representation can be built based on approaches that are accessible, participatory, interactive, ethical, and transparent, and that reach a far broader public. This expansive vision of open science will lead to a more unified knowledge economy.

AB  - I t has now been more than a decade since the Budapest Open Access Initiative coined the term open access (OA) and united a movement to free scholarly literature from access barriers.Incredible progress has been made in this time with the launching of thousands of OA journals, open repositories, and mandates from institutions, funders, and various levels of government in countries around the world.The momentum only seems to be increasing in recent years.OA is now considered to be inevitable, with one prediction estimating that it will be the dominant model for scholarly literature in the next decade. 1 This guide is intended to be a practical tool to help busy researchers, and the librarians who support them, make the transition to OA.The focus herein is on freely available online resources that will assist in making research publications OA; the closely associated, and rapidly growing, area of research data is beyond the scope of this column.

AB  - The study investigates the awareness, practices and attitudes of researchers in regard to open data – i.e. the sharing and reuse of research data – which is part of a larger study that concentrated on the scholarly communication readiness of Malaysian researchers in Open Science. The data were gathered by means of a survey which obtained 135 responses from researchers based in five research universities in Malaysia. The main conclusions are: (a) the researchers are aware of open data, yet, they are not practising it as shown in the mean scores, as well as in their responses towards the statements asked; (b) unclear information on data privacy policy, misuse of data, and the fear of losing publication opportunity are part of disincentives for data sharing. The requisite for open data understanding, practices and attitudinal change is needed for these may impact research practices, government policies and scientific knowledge, leading to research transparency and accountability, social benefit and economic growth. This paper concludes with a discussion that policies incentivizing the sharing and reuse of open data, as well as tools and guidance to support data sharing, and a strong incentives and rewards to implement open data among researchers, should be encouraged. Future studies should look into the importance of rewards for data sharing among researchers’ institutions. Studies bridging the gap between policy and practices of open data should be examined, if true openness in research is to be established in Malaysia.

AB  - Current approaches to plagiarism detection often focus on finding lexical matches rather than semantic similarities in the text content that is compared.But the more important unanswered questions remain whether similar concepts expressed in related topical contexts are semantically equivalent as idea-laundering plagiarism by humans or algorithm-generated plagiarism by machines.Now publicly available and easily accessible, text-generating algorithms have automated the process of assembling a text derived from but not attributed to published content scraped from the web.The FAIR Metrics, with FAIR an acronym for Fair Attribution to Indexed Reports and Fair Acknowledgment of Information Records, measure how appropriately a document cites prior records based on whether they contain similar claims that are equivalent in meaning.We demonstrate herein a workflow with results for manual evaluation of the FAIR Metrics to quantify the extent of plagiarism in 8 articles retracted or reported for plagiarism.We also demonstrate use of the Nexus-PORTAL-DOORS-Scribe (NPDS) Cyberinfrastructure to manage semantic descriptions of the concept mappings and entity equivalence evaluations made using concepts and relationships from the PDP-DREAM Ontology.

AB  - Abstract To manage the transition to the open access (OA) model of scholarly publishing, we need to understand better what enables, encourages and inhibits the adoption of OA publishing among scientists, and to appreciate individual differences within disciplines. The study adopts a psychological perspective to elucidate motivations, capabilities and opportunities for OA publishing among bioscientists in the UK. To identify differences within the discipline, bioscientists with starkly different past practices for disclosing research data and technologies were interviewed. The sampled bioscientists face similar obstacles and enablers in their physical environment, but that their motivations and experience of their social environments differ. One group is strongly motivated by their moral convictions and beliefs in benefits of OA and feels peer pressure related to OA. The other group expresses fewer pro-OA beliefs, holds beliefs demotivating OA publishing, but feels pressure from research funders to adopt it. The former group makes more frequent use of OA publishing, which suggests that only those with strong motivations will work to overcome the social and physical obstacles. The individual differences within the discipline suggest that bioscientists are unlikely to respond to OA policies in the same way and, thus, the appropriateness of one-size-fits-all OA policies is questioned.

AB  - Collection management (as opposed to collection development) should be understood as the activity of adding value to—or deleting value from—objects of information subsequent to their selection. The management of materials in traditional formats will become increasingly problematic the more we move into an online environment. Although digital resources will sooner or later come to dominate scholarly communication, the effective management of traditional materials will remain essential. While a central goal of libraries must be to manage traditional and digital resources as two aspects of a single service, we must also recognize that all information services will eventually be conditioned by a digital mentality. In order to start planning now for collection management to play a more prominent role in the future of information services, we must begin to define with as much precision as possible the abstract values collection management adds to and deletes from selected information objects.

AB  - The issue this article aims to address is the fact that publications may nowadays be used to assess impact and quality of research in ways academics may not be fully aware of. During recent years, scholarly publications have gained in importance, not primarily as the traditional vehicle for the dissemination of new scientific findings, but as a foundation for assessing the production and impact of organizations, research groups and individual researchers. This means that publications as artefacts per se are starting to play a new important role in the scientific community and that researchers need to be aware of how publication and citation counts are being used to assess their research and the outreach, impact and reputation of their mother organization. University rankings, for instance, often have some parameters based on the publishing of the ranked institution. This article is thus not about scientific writing as such; it focuses on what happens to your publication after the publishing has taken place and on aspects to take into account while planning the publishing of your article, report or book.

AB  - INTRODUCTION As academic libraries expand their scholarly communication support, they also need to find ways to help educate graduate students about this area as well as market themselves. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM The University of Nevada, Reno Libraries created a one-day symposium, called Manuscript Accepted!, aimed at graduate students and early career faculty that would use faculty and library expertise to lead panels and workshops. This article discusses planning for the event, including collaborating with other on-campus groups, working with publishers for financial support, and planning a program that would meet a variety of needs. Assessment of the first two symposiums, held in 2019 and 2020, shows that attendees valued the event while also highlighting the need for more targeted support for specific areas, such as the humanities. NEXT STEPS The Libraries plans to continue Manuscript Accepted! as a one-day symposium, although it will also look to ways to expand attendance. Finally, the Libraries is investigating ways to create smaller events that could be tied into the Manuscript Acceptance! brand but that help meet other needs of our attendees.

AB  - The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Manuscript Exchange Common Approach (MECA) project is a cross-organization industry initiative to develop a common approach to manuscript transfer that can be adopted across the scholarly publishing industry. MECA establishes a vocabulary set that includes transfer, review, and manifest models. These models are designed to work with different article XML schemas, including the latest NISO Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) standard (v1.2). In order to avoid conflicts between these project vocabularies and the JATS, we reviewed the MECA vocabularies against the NISO JATS Compatibility Meta Model (v0.7). This paper describes the review and analysis of the MECA schemas against the JATS Meta Model, how we documented the analysis, and the recommendations we made to resolve issues revealed by the analysis. It includes the documentation we produced to communicate the results of the analysis and what actions we took to move forward with the project, including both changes to the schemas and requests for changes in the JATS. We hope sharing our experiences with this process will help others who are trying to do the same.

AB  - One of the alternatives to revive the religious manuscript researcher and scholar passion is by providing an easy online reference about religious manuscript. Some manuscript researcher of ex-Office of Religious Research and Development Ministry of Religious Affairs have started to make and maintain an online repository about religious manuscripts since 2019. The plentiful manuscript data, which is resulted from research, contain philological description aspect and digital photo file needs to be followed up more than just a research report or catalogue. It also needs to be easily accessible by other scholar and researcher in an open access repository. This online repository, managed by the researcher team, contain almost 450 religious manuscripts from Madura. The other data that will be uploaded are Islamic manuscript found in Bali, manuscript by K.H. Ahmad Rifa’i Kalisalak, Syaikh Mahfudz Termas, and also from K.H. Hasyim Asy’ari. Using descriptive qualitative method, this paper aims to answer and introduce to three aspects, namely: a) the importance of providing an open access of religious manuscript using online repository; b) the content and general description of religious manuscript online repository; and c) the guidelines on how to access and download the manuscript from online repository.

AB  - This study analyzes the implementation of open science in Spanish universities considering four perspectives: (i) regulations, policies, and strategies; (ii) knowledge production; (iii) research results; and (iv) perception by different academic actors. A qualitative and quantitative methodology is applied, drawing information from university websites, institutional reports, European project databases (Cordis), the Web of Science database, surveys of teaching and research staff, and surveys of vice-rectors and library directors. The information is grouped into regional university systems, according to the autonomous community to which each university belongs, and is analyzed on that basis. The results of the quantitative study show increasing interest in open-science activities, expressed as a growing number of publications, and an increase in participation, leadership, and funding in European projects. Institutional policies and regulations on open science, on the other hand, are few and focus almost exclusively on open access. The development of institutional repositories is one of the great achievements of the Spanish university system, and open-access publishing (mainly green open access) has grown considerably in the last decade. Teaching and research staff are not knowledgeable about open science, although in general they take a positive view toward it, while university policymakers report that most actions to promote open science are still in the process of being implemented. The results reveal heterogeneity among the various institutions’ practices and implementation. As a regional system, the Catalonian university system stands out above the rest for its degree of open-science policy development and implementation and for its intense research activity in the field of open science.

AB  - Nearly ten years ago, scholarly publishing came to the fore in research on scientific communication spurred by the evolving Open Science system, the reinvention of peer reviews, and new attitudes to scholarly publications in the ranking-based academic environment. Here, the JLE editors revisit the field of scholarly publishing and identify the most popular areas where potential JLE authors might have difficulty. In this editorial, Scopus-indexed reviews are analysed to map the prevailing trends. The editorial review shows that the trends include open access, peer review transparency, the changing role of libraries in scholarly publishing, CrossRef’s initiatives, outsourcing and skills lacking in publishing, the impact of universities’ prescribed lists for publishing research, open-access monographs, and the role of commercial publishers.

AB  - Abstract In the current scientific and political discourse surrounding the transformation of the scientific publication system, significant attention is focused on Diamond Open Access (OA). Diamond OA is characterized by no charges for readers or authors and relies on monetary allowances and voluntary work. This article explores the potential and challenges of Diamond OA journals, using Germany as a case study. Two key questions are addressed: first, the current role of such journals in the scientific publication system is determined through bibliometric analysis across various disciplines. Second, an investigation is conducted to assess the sustainability of Diamond OA journals and identify associated structural problems or potential breaking points. This investigation includes an in-depth expert interview study involving 20 editors of Diamond OA journals. The empirical results are presented using a landscape map that considers two dimensions: 'monetized and gift-based completion of tasks' and 'journal team size.' The bibliometric analysis reveals a substantial number of Diamond OA journals in the social sciences and humanities, but limited adoption in other fields. The model proves effective for small to mid-sized journals, but not for larger ones. Additionally, it was found that 23 Diamond OA journals have recently discontinued their operations. The expert interviews demonstrate the diversity within the landscape and the usefulness of the two dimensions in understanding key differences. Journals in two of the four quadrants of the map exemplify sustainable conditions, while the other two quadrants raise concerns about long-term stability. These concerns include limited funding leading to a lack of division of labor and an excessive burden on highly committed members. Gift-like contributions, while appealing, also present challenges as potential donors not only decide whether to contribute but also how to contribute, potentially creating friction between the gift and the journal's requirements. Furthermore, journals in the lower right quadrant often rely on third-party funding, necessitating a transformation once the funding expires. Common pathways for sustaining operations include lobbying for funding at the journal's home institution or increasing reliance on gift-based completion of tasks. These findings underscore the need for the development of more sustainable funding models to ensure the success of Diamond OA journals.

AB  - This paper discusses MathML, an XML-based standard for expressing mathematics - everything from elementary mathematics to undergraduate college-level mathematics. Limitations of pre-existing options led to the creation of MathML. MathML is designed to be useful for authoring and publishing, for creating online interactive math resources, and as a non-proprietary approach for archiving. MathML is supported by the W3C and by multiple scholarly publishers and vendors of computer-based mathematics software. The question now is whether MathML can achieve greater acceptance among authors and better integration with standards in related domains, either through cross-walks or through direct incorporation into other domain schemas.

AB  - INTRODUCTION In the last decade, a significant number of institutions have adopted open access (OA) policies. Many of those working with OA policies are tasked with measuring policy compliance. This article reports on a survey of Coalition of Open Access Policy Institutions (COAPI) members designed to better understand the methods currently used for measuring and communicating OA policy success. METHODS This electronic survey was distributed to the COAPI member listserv, inviting both institutions who have passed an implemented policies and those who are still developing policies to participate. RESULTS The results to a number of questions related to topics such as policy workflows, quantitative and qualitative measurement activities and related tools, and challenges showed a wide range of responses, which are shared here. DISCUSSION It is clear that a number of COAPI members struggle with identifying what should be measured and what tools and methods are appropriate. The survey illustrates how each institution measures compliance differently, making it difficult to benchmark against peer institutions. CONCLUSION As a result of this survey, we recommend that institutions working with OA policies be as transparent as possible about their data sources and methods when calculating deposit rates and other quantitative measures. It is hoped that this transparency will result in the development of a set of qualitative and quantitative best practices for assessing OA policies that standardizes assessment terminology and articulates why institutions may want to measure policies.

We will discuss the impact of OA on scholarly publishing, focusing on how economic factors and discipline-specific practices shape its adoption. Additionally, we will examine the transformation of OA models, the citation benefits of a hybrid OA model, and regional perspectives. Our analysis identifies key challenges and disparities in OA adoption and suggests future directions for achieving sustainable and equitable access to research.

AB  - This study assesses the extent and nature of open access scholarly publishing in Brazil, one of the world’s leaders in providing universal access to its research and scholarship. It utilizes Brazil’s Qualis journal evaluation system, along with other relevant data bases to address the association between scholarly quality and open access in the Brazilian context. Through cross tabulation among these various data sets, it is possible to arrive at a reasonably accurate picture of journals, systems, ratings, and disciplines. The study establishes reliable measures and counts of Brazilian scholarly publications, the proportion and types of open access, and journals ratings and by disciplinary field. It finds that the better the Brazilian journal, the more likely it is to be open access. It also finds that Qualis ranks Brazilian journals lower overall than the international journals in which Brazilian authors publish, most notably in the field of the biological sciences. The study concludes with a consideration of the policy implications for building on the country’s global leadership in open access to strengthen the quality of its global contribution to knowledge.

AB  - Objective – This paper explores how to utilize two well-known library databases, Thomson Reuter’s Web of Science and Elsevier’s Scopus, to quantify Long Island educational institutions’ scholarly productivity.&#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – Institutions located in the Long Island region and within Nassau and Suffolk counties, including the State University of New York (SUNY) colleges, private institutions, and technical schools, were examined for the last 14 years (2000–2013). Eight Long Island institutions were represented in both databases and were included in the study.&#x0D; &#x0D; Results – Of the eight institutions, Stony Brook University produced the most publications indexed in Web of Science and Scopus during the period of 2000–2013. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory yielded the second most publications during 2000–2013 in both Web of Science and Scopus, but it produced the highest quality publications compared with other institutions excluding Stony Brook University. Although the annual growth rates of Farmingdale State College and New York Institute of Technology increased dramatically in both Web of Science and Scopus, the large proportional increase did not represent a large increase in total value. Additionally, some institutions had a higher number of publications indexed in Web of Science than in Scopus, and others had a higher number of publications indexed in Scopus than in Web of Science.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusions – Data were collected from institutions in Long Island with various institutional sizes, the number of faculty members employed may have made an impact on the number of publications. Thus, publication data in this study cannot be used to compare their rankings. Institutions with a similar type and similar size of faculty members should be selected for comparison. Due to the different coverage and scope of Web of Science and Scopus, institutions should use both databases to examine their scholarly output. Furthermore, institutions should consider using altmetrics to capture various impacts of the scholarly output to complement the traditional metrics.

AB  - Qualitative scientific journals play a vital role in scholarly communication processes. However, during the last few years, there is a mushroom growth of journals in every discipline in India. There has been no single source of systematic advice on how to measure the scientific value of Indian journals. The present study is an attempt to minimize the gap by developing a mechanism for measuring scientific value of Indian journals. Consulting various international databases and their journal inclusion policy, a viable mechanism has been devised and tested with 100+ Indian journals in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology. The results indicate that although the quantity of yearly additions of new journals in each of the three disciplines is quite impressive, the yearly discontinuation is also alarming. Almost 29% of physics journals, 11% of chemistry journals and 21% of biology journals were stopped within a year. Although irregularity in publication, improper execution of review process, non-disclosure of article processing charges, lower percentage of foreign contributors and low citation rate were identified as some drawbacks with Indian physics, chemistry and biology journals. The percentage of predatory journals in these three disciplines is quite less till date. In order to choose a better platform of scholarly publishing, this study suggests some recommendations for prospective authors.

AB  - Abstract The increasing centrality of persistent identifiers (PIDs) to scholarly ecosystems and the contribution they can make to the burgeoning “PID graph” has the potential to transform scholarship. Despite their importance as originators of PID data, little is known about researchers’ awareness and understanding of PIDs, or their efficacy in using them. In this article, we report on the results of an online interactive test designed to elicit exploratory data about researcher awareness and understanding of PIDs. This instrument was designed to explore recognition of PIDs (e.g. Digital Object Identifiers [DOIs], Open Researcher and Contributor IDs [ORCIDs], etc.) and the extent to which researchers correctly apply PIDs within digital scholarly ecosystems, as well as measure researchers’ perceptions of PIDs. Our results reveal irregular patterns of PID understanding and certainty across all participants, though statistically significant disciplinary and academic job role differences were observed in some instances. Uncertainty and confusion were found to exist in relation to dominant schemes such as ORCID and DOIs, even when contextualized within real-world examples. We also show researchers’ perceptions of PIDs to be generally positive but that disciplinary differences can be noted, as well as higher levels of aversion to PIDs in specific use cases and negative perceptions where PIDs are measured on an “activity” semantic dimension. This work therefore contributes to our understanding of scholars’ “PID literacy” and should inform those designing PID-centric scholarly infrastructures that a significant need for training and outreach to active researchers remains necessary.

AB  - HowOpenIsIt is a guide created by SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition), PLOS (Public Library of Science), and OASPA (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association) to describe an array of policies a journal can have in the continuum between “Open” and “Closed.” The OAS Evaluation Tool uses the HowOpenIsIt guide to measure the degree of openness of journals of all kinds with scores between 0 and 100. A total of 1,005 journal samples, both OA and non-OA journals in various languages and from various parts of the world, were evaluated and scored with the OAS Evaluation Tool by a team of information professionals in 2015 based on the policies posted on journals' websites. This article reports the findings of the OAS evaluation.

AB  - For two decades, open access (OA) has gained momentum worldwide. However, adoption of OA in Canada is lagging compared with other countries. Using data from Dimensions and Érudit, this paper provides an overview of OA dissemination in Canada, focusing on the effect of institutions, language, and funding. Papers in French, and from Quebec universities, are more likely to be OA, while papers from engineering-oriented institutions are less likely to be OA. Regarding funders, those in health sciences have higher OA compliance. The paper concludes discussing disciplinary differences in OA dissemination, low compliance to OA mandates in Canada, and the role of Érudit.

AB  - Open access institutional repositories were created to promote access to information, encourage scholarly communication, and demonstrate institutional prestige. While these repositories have been widely adopted, the quality of their contents often fails to represent their institution's scholarly output. Moreover, current research uses measurements of quantity, not quality, to assess their value. In response, this article opens new areas of scholarly inquiry by assessing the quality of contents. This is accomplished through a cross-sectional study of repositories at American colleges and universities across the academic spectrum, using citation indexing to identify an institution's articles and authors of highest impact.

AB  - How common is self-citation in scholarly publication, and does the practice vary by gender? Using novel methods and a data set of 1.5 million research papers in the scholarly database JSTOR published between 1779 and 2011, the authors find that nearly 10 percent of references are self-citations by a paper’s authors. The findings also show that between 1779 and 2011, men cited their own papers 56 percent more than did women. In the last two decades of data, men self-cited 70 percent more than women. Women are also more than 10 percentage points more likely than men to not cite their own previous work at all. While these patterns could result from differences in the number of papers that men and women authors have published rather than gender-specific patterns of self-citation behavior, this gender gap in self-citation rates has remained stable over the last 50 years, despite increased representation of women in academia. The authors break down self-citation patterns by academic field and number of authors and comment on potential mechanisms behind these observations. These findings have important implications for scholarly visibility and cumulative advantage in academic careers.

AB  - Over the last five years, scholarly publishing has turned its attention towards metadata; increasingly recognizing it as a strategic priority for digital development. In a 2017 Imbue Partners study based on interviews with industry leaders, metadata was identified as of the highest importance in digital transformation. With an understanding that metadata improvements can be most efficiently made in collaboration, scholarly communications communities are now convening to find ways to jointly improve metadata.Metadata 2020 is a project-driven collaboration of over 120 individuals across scholarly communications, convening to find ways to improve metadata that is connected, reusable, and open for all research outputs. Having launched in September 2017, the collaboration now includes 5 community groups and 6 projects.We include publishers, librarians, service providers, data publishers and repositories, researchers and funders in our work to advance metadata for scholarly communications, to ensure consideration of all stakeholder needs in scholarly communications.In this presentation, we will outline some of the key observations of our community groups around the metadata challenges they face; and explain how these observations evolved into the formation of our 6 cross-community projects. The projects that we will briefly outline include:Researcher CommunicationsMetadata Recommendations and Element MappingsDefining the Terms We Use About MetadataIncentives for Improving Metadata QualityShared Best Practice and PrinciplesMetadata Evaluation and GuidanceGiving a brief overview of the remit and progress to date of each project, we will invite participation from attendees, and provide information about when key resources and guidance will be made available to the communities we serve.

This article illustrates how existing information about available resources can be repurposed fairly easily and cheaply using standard tools. However the publishing of this information throws up a number of practical and philosophical questions which have to be addressed by projects and institutions.

AB  - Like Hegel’s owl of Minerva, scholars are arriving at the realization of the existence of the knowledge economy after dusk. (Drahos and Braithwaite, 2002, p. 39)Houghton and Oppenheim’s cost–benefit analysis of different forms of scholarly publishing is a major contribution in considering the case for open access and for open institutional repositories as a standard resource in publicly-funded universities. Understanding these issues through empirically-informed profiles of national systems of research and innovation is a significant advance, but to focus only on this is to be distracted from significant and more general issues about the ways in which knowledge is produced, particularly in universities, and the requirements and opportunities for such work in the contemporary knowledge economy. As with Hegel’s owl of wisdom, the true meaning of major new ways of doing things can only be appreciated later in the day, when both the innovation and its implications are clearer.

AB  - Abstract Research data management (RDM) is needed to assist experimental advances and data collection in the chemical sciences. Many funders require RDM because experiments are often paid for by taxpayers and the resulting data should be deposited sustainably for posterity. However, paper notebooks are still common in laboratories and research data is often stored in proprietary and/or dead‐end file formats without experimental context. Data must mature beyond a mere supplement to a research paper. Electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and laboratory information management systems (LIMS) allow researchers to manage data better and they simplify research and publication. Thus, an agreement is needed on minimum information standards for data handling to support structured approaches to data reporting. As digitalization becomes part of curricular teaching, future generations of digital native chemists will embrace RDM and ELN as an organic part of their research.

AB  - In 2019, MIT Press and University of Michigan Press launched their own ebook collections for direct sale to libraries. Nearly a year has gone by. In that year, three basic truths have emerged and continue to guide them on this journey: 1. Establish Principles - Our principles must be our central reference point. We must innovate by taking a “values-based” approach not just a solely “value-based” selection process. 2. Embrace Exploration, Agility and Humility - We are perpetual searchers and seekers, always novices and beginners. Transformation comes from discovering the right questions more than having the right answers. 2. Take Action - We cannot think ourselves into new ways of acting, rather we act ourselves into a new way of thinking. Impactful change will only happen when we take risks, focus on people, and shift from monologue to dialogue when engaging with the communities we serve. How did they come to these truths? What are the prospects for each of their individual endeavors? Why should libraries care? In this paper, representatives of the two presses will tell their respective stories about this last year’s adventures. We they share why they chose to work directly with libraries, what they expected after launching their new collections, as well as divulge what reality actually dealt them.

AB  - Three years ago, the Gold and Green Roads to Open Access were viewed as complementary strategies, with repositories having the potential of gradually behaving more like journals, and vice versa. Since then, repositories and journals have been progressing on parallel tracks. Re-examining the situation, the reasoning suggested in 2004 appears still valid. Simultaneously, a knowledge economy has made of science a strategic resource. The developing world is essentially invited to contribute to world science with little or no regard to the development of an autonomous scientific capacity. Open Access, in this context, takes a new meaning with one objective to help development of local and autonomous scientific capacity. However, to do so, mixing and matching repositories with journals is needed. Brazil exemplifies this type of development and shows how the Green and Gold roads can mix and match.

AB  - This article characterizes key weaknesses in the ability of current digital libraries to support scholarly inquiry, and as a way to address these, proposes computational services grounded in semiformal models of the naturalistic argumentation commonly found in research literatures. It is argued that a design priority is to balance formal expressiveness with usability, making it critical to coevolve the modeling scheme with appropriate user interfaces for argument construction and analysis. We specify the requirements for an argument modeling scheme for use by untrained researchers and describe the resulting ontology, contrasting it with other domain modeling and semantic web approaches, before discussing passive and intelligent user interfaces designed to support analysts in the construction, navigation, and analysis of scholarly argument structures in a Web-based environment. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - As open access publishing has become more widespread and required by research funders and the research community, the management and monitoring of article processing charges (APCs) have emerged as an important task in research organisations around the world. Within this tendency, a question of the comprehensiveness of organisational APC monitoring has become relevant. This case study demonstrates how the comprehensiveness of in-house APC monitoring can be evaluated using international bibliographic information sources like Web of Science and Scopus, where it is possible to identify the corresponding author, as well as Unpaywall and DOAJ, which contain information about the open access statuses and APCs of articles. Based on study results, it can be assumed that the organisation’s in-house bookkeeping has succeeded in registering 52 percent of APC invoices while 48 percent have not been identified. The results show that the number of unreported publications that have been openly published and whose corresponding author is affiliated with the university is almost equal to those registered in the university’s institutional APC report. The study describes the stages of data collection and processing in order of implementation, which allows a similar review to be feasible in another organisation. At the end of the article, development proposals are presented for both the organisations’ in-house data collection and the content of publishers’ invoices.

AB  - The number of scholarly journal articles published each year is growing, but little is known about the relationship between journal article growth and other forms of scholarly dissemination (e.g., books and monographs). Journal articles are the de facto currency of evaluation and prestige in STEM fields, but social scientists routinely publish books as well as articles, representing a unique opportunity to study increased article publications in disciplines with other dissemination options. We studied the publishing activity of social science faculty members in 12 disciplines at 290 Ph.D. granting institutions in the United States between 2011 and 2019, asking: 1) have publication practices changed such that more or fewer books and articles are written now than in the recent past?; 2) has the percentage of scholars actively participating in a particular publishing type changed over time?; and 3) do different age cohorts evince different publication strategies? In all disciplines, journal articles per person increased between 3% and 64% between 2011 and 2019, while books per person decreased by at least 31% and as much as 54%. All age cohorts show increased article authorship over the study period, and early career scholars author more articles per person than the other cohorts in eight disciplines. The article-dominated literatures of the social sciences are becoming increasingly similar to those of STEM disciplines.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Internet and the rise of e‐Science alter the conditions for scholarly communication. In signing declarations against open access mandates, society publishers indicate that they feel most threatened by the emergence of institutional repositories and the self‐archiving mandates that these make possible. More attention should be paid to the impact of e‐Science, the rise of Internet‐based guild publishers, and the entrance of players from the new economy. Society journals should stop aspiring to such functions as registration and archiving and should shed electronic dissemination, while enhancing certification and investing in (new) navigation services.

TI  - Moving peer review transparency from process to praxis
VL  - 32
AU  - Ford, Emily
C1  - Urban & Public Affairs Librarian and Associate Professor Portland State University Oregon
AB  - Scholarly publications often work to provide transparency of peer-review processes, posting policy information to their websites as suggested by the Committee on Publication Ethics' (COPE) Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Publishing. Yet this falls short in providing peer-review transparency. Using examples from an interview-based qualitative study, this article argues that scholarly publications should move from peer-review process transparency to a praxis of transparency in peer review. Praxis infers that values inform practices. Scholarly publications should therefore use clear communication practices in all matters of business, and bolster transparency efforts, delineating rights and responsibilities of all players in peer review. Moreover, the scholarly publishing community should offer improved and society-led referee and editor training, rather than leaving the commercial publishing industry to fill the gap which results in peer review as a service to industry's needs – turning an efficient profit – and not the scholarly community's needs for human-to-human discourse.

AB  - Technical reports have always posed problems for libraries and librarians. They are often bibliographically inconsistent, difficult to source, and published to varying standards of quality. In some science and technical fields, these reports are also large in number and central in importance. Additionally, established workflows for acquiring and preserving technical reports in distributed repositories have been undermined by the transition from print to digital. Overall, the "grey literature" challenges librarians face have increased.

TI  - National and International Library Collaboration: Necessity, Advantages
IS  - 3-4
VL  - 17
AU  - Mark, Timothy
AB  - The advantages of cooperation between research library associations can be demonstrated quite clearly. Where cooperation becomes essential is where there is a common cause to champion or an initiative to pursue for the common good. Thanks in part to the power of information communications technology, research is becoming increasingly international in scope. The members of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research teams are frequently drawn from across the world. Correspondingly, scholarly publishing (especially in medicine and the sciences) is dominated by a few multinational publishers. In this context, issues that play a vital role in global scholarly communication - such as copyright, journal pricing, the managing of datasets, digital preservation and open access - are issues for the research library community everywhere in the world. Certainly there are many challenges at the local or regional level. However there are definite roles that research library associations can play most effectively at the national or international level. It is clear that by sharing expertise, building partnerships and alliances, it is possible to address common issues much more effectively than when working alone. What is special is that potentially the most powerful form of cooperation is advocacy at the national and international levels. It is essential for research library associations to work together at the political level to move their agenda forward. Examples are lobbying about copyright legislation (nationally, or within the EC or at WIPO); or promoting the cause of Open Access. The unique value of LIBER is to provide a forum and a platform for European research library associations to explore and benefit from cooperation and their shared strength.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This paper presents an overview of different kinds of lists of scholarly publication channels and of experiences related to the construction and maintenance of national lists supporting performance-based research funding systems. It also contributes with a set of recommendations for the construction and maintenance of national lists of journals and book publishers. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on analysis of previously published studies, policy papers, and reported experiences related to the construction and use of lists of scholarly publication channels. Findings Several countries have systems for research funding and/or evaluation, that involve the use of national lists of scholarly publication channels (mainly journals and publishers). Typically, such lists are selective (do not include all scholarly or non-scholarly channels) and differentiated (distinguish between channels of different levels and quality). At the same time, most lists are embedded in a system that encompasses multiple or all disciplines. This raises the question how such lists can be organized and maintained to ensure that all relevant disciplines and all types of research are adequately represented. Research limitation The conclusions and recommendations of the study are based on the authors’ interpretation of a complex and sometimes controversial process with many different stakeholders involved. Practical implications The recommendations and the related background information provided in this paper enable mutual learning that may feed into improvements in the construction and maintenance of national and other lists of scholarly publication channels in any geographical context. This may foster a development of responsible evaluation practices. Originality/value This paper presents the first general overview and typology of different kinds of publication channel lists, provides insights on expert-based versus metrics-based evaluation, and formulates a set of recommendations for the responsible construction and maintenance of publication channel lists.

AB  - Digital scholarship issues are increasingly prevalent in today’s environment. We are faced with questions of how to protect our own works as well as others’ with responsible attribution and usage, sometimes involving a formal agreement. These may come in the form of Creative Commons Licensing, provisions of the U.S. Copyright Act, or terms of use outlined by contractual agreements with library vendors. Librarians at Eastern Carolina University and Kansas State University (K-State) are among several university libraries now providing services to assist with navigating these sometimes legalistic frameworks. East Carolina University Libraries are taking initiatives to familiarize faculty, researchers, and students with Open Educational Resources and Creative Commons Licensing. At K-State, librarians in digital scholarship and electronic resources identified the overlap of their subject matters through their correspondence regarding users’ copyright and licensing questions; a partnership formed, and they implemented a proactive and public-facing approach to better meet user needs and liability concerns at a major research university.

AB  - From ancient times, African civilization has participated in knowledge production and dissemination. The nature of research production and publishing in Africa varied throughout the years according to the influences and infrastructures present at each point in time. The colonization era was a landmark in the evolution of research practice and research publishing in Africa. It had consequences that lasted long after independence and contributed to the underdevelopment of research production and publishing systems in Africa. Currently, Africa is lagging behind in terms of its contribution to global research. An increase in African research output and an improvement of its visibility are needed. The digitization of research publishing holds great opportunities for the enhancement of scholarly publishing systems in Africa, yet it is faced with challenges. This article identifies the major challenges faced by governments, institutions, and scholars in digitizing research publishing in Africa. These challenges include limited funding, poor infrastructures, low research output, language barriers, difficulties in establishing quality assurance, copyright issues, data-management issues, and lack of policies and regulations. Addressing these challenges in local contexts is necessary to enhance digital research publishing in Africa.

AB  - The full release and circulation of excavation results often takes decades, thus slowing down progress in archaeology to a degree not in keeping with other scientific fields. The nonconformity of released data for digital processing also requires vast and costly data input and adaptation. Archaeology should face the cognitive challenges posed by digital environments, changing in scope and rhythm. We advocate the adoption of a synergy between recording techniques, field analytics, and a collaborative approach to create a new epistemological perspective, one in which research questions are constantly redefined through real-time, collaborative analysis of data as they are collected and/or searched for in an excavation. Since new questions are defined in science discourse after previous results have been disseminated and discussed within the scientific community, sharing evidence in remote with colleagues, both in the process of field collection and subsequent study, will be a key innovative feature, allowing a complex and real-time distant interaction with the scholarly community and leading to more rapid improvements in research agendas and queries.

AB  - This article examines how consortia can engage commercial publishers' hybrid open access (OA) publication programs. The article argues that it is appropriate and necessary for consortia to demonstrate leadership in influencing the information marketplace. Two models for negotiations are examined: 1) “market determinative” strategy, and 2) “consortium discount” strategy, comprised of three variations on existing consortia practices. An examination of the advantages and challenges indicates that the latter would have a greater chance for success. Keys to this conclusion include: establishing linkages between consortium licensing and hybrid titles, cost containment/alignment, and engaging publishers through an integrated model approach.

AU  - Hosoi, Mihoko
C1  - Pennsylvania State University
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an opportunity for academic libraries to advance open access (OA) to scholarly articles. Awareness among faculty on the importance of OA has increased significantly during the pandemic, as colleges and universities struggle financially and seek sustainable access to high-quality scholarly journals. Consortia have played an important role in establishing negotiation principles on OA journal agreements. While the number of OA agreements is increasing, case studies involving individual libraries are still limited. This paper reviews existing literature on publisher negotiation principles related to OA journal negotiations and reflects on recent cases at an academic library in Pennsylvania, in order to identify best practices in OA journal negotiations. It provides recommendations on roles, relationships, and processes, as well as essential terms of OA journal agreements. This study’s findings are most relevant to large academic libraries that are interested in negotiating with scholarly journal publishers independently or through consortia.

AB  - Learning scientific document representations can be substantially improved through contrastive learning objectives, where the challenge lies in creating positive and negative training samples that encode the desired similarity semantics. Prior work relies on discrete citation relations to generate contrast samples. However, discrete citations enforce a hard cut-off to similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning and ignores that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation - a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SciDocs benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can train (or tune) language models sample-efficiently and that it can be combined with recent training-efficient methods. Perhaps surprisingly, even training a general-domain language model this way outperforms baselines pretrained in-domain.

IS  - 1
AU  - Stojanovski, Jadranka

AB  - &gt;&gt; See video of presentation (28 min.) The primary goal of scholarly communication is improving human knowledge and sharing is the key to achieve this goal: sharing ideas, sharing methodologies, sharing of results, sharing data, information and knowledge. Although the concept of sharing applies to all phases of scholarly communication, most often the only visible part is the final publication, with the journal article as a most common type. The traditional characteristics of the present journals allow only limited possibilities for sharing the knowledge. Basic functions, registration, dissemination, certification, and storage, are still present but they are no more effective in the network environment. Registration is too slow, there are various barriers to dissemination, certification system has many shortcomings, and used formats are not suitable for the long term preservation and storage. Although the journals today are digital and various powerful technologies are available, they are still focused on their unaltered printed versions. This presentation will discuss possible evolution of journal article to become more compliant with users' needs and to enable “the four R’s of openness” – reuse, redistribute, revise and remix (Hilton, Wiley, Stein, &amp; Johnson, 2010).Several aspects of openness will be presented and discussed: open access, open data, open peer review, open authorship, and open formats. With digital technology which has become indispensable in the creation, collection, processing and storage of data in all scientific disciplines the way of conducting scientific research has changed and the concept of "data-driven science" has been introduced (Ware &amp; Mabe, 2009). Sharing research data enhances the capabilities of reproducing the results, reuse maximizes the value of research, accelerating the advancement of science, ensuring transparency of scientific research, reducing the possibility of bias in the interpretation of results and increasing the credibility of published scientific knowledge. The open peer review can ensure full transparency of the entire process of assessment and help to solve many problems in the present scholarly publishing. Through the process of the open peer review each manuscript can be immediately accessible, reviewers can publicly demonstrate their expertise and could be rewarded, and readers can be encouraged to make comments and views and to become active part of the scholarly communication process. The trend to to describe the author's contribution is also present, which will certainly lead to a reduced number of “ghost”, "guest" and "honorary" authors, and will help to establish better standards for author’s identification.Various web technologies can be used also for the semantic enhancement of the article. One of the most important aspects of semantic publication is the inclusion of the research data, to make them available to the user as an active data that can be manipulated. It is possible to integrate data from external sources, or to merge the data from different resources (data fusion) (Shotton, 2012), so the reader can gain further understanding of the presented data. Additional options provide merging data from different articles, with the addition of the component of time. Other semantic enhancement can include enriched bibliography, interactive graphical presentations, hyperlinks to external resources, tagged text, etc.Instead of mostly static content, journals can offer readers dynamic content that includes multimedia, "living mathematics", “executable articles”, etc. Videos highlighting critical points in the research process, 3D representations of chemical compounds or art works, audio clips with the author's reflections and interviews, and animated simulations or models of ocean currents, tides, temperature and salinity structure, can became soon common part of every research article. The diversity of content and media, operating systems (GNU / Linux, Apple Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows), and software tools that are available to researchers, suggests the usage of the appropriate open formats. Different formats have their advantages and disadvantages and it would be necessary to make multiple formats available, some of which are suitable for "human" reading (including printing on paper), and some for machine reading that can be used by computers without human intervention. Characteristics and possibilities of several formats will be discussed, including XML as the most recommended format, which can enable granulate document structure as well as deliver semantics to the human reader or to the computer.Literature:Hilton, J.

TI  - New Identities in Peer Review: Who Are They and Why Are They Important?
AU  - do Amaral, Janaynne
AB  - Exalted by some people and criticized by others, since the peer review system has been implemented in scholarly journals it has transformed into an effective tool to select manuscripts of scientific merit for publication. Henry Oldenburg, the first Secretary of the Royal Society and creator of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (founded 1665), was one of the pioneers in implementing peer review in scientific journals. He started the peer-review system in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society by inviting 3 members of the Royal Society “who had more knowledge of the matters in question than he, to comment on submissions prior to making the decision about whether to publish.”1 At that time, the development of the peer-review system was linked to the concerns of scientists as science producers and consumers.2 As science producers, they wanted to have their work recognized by publishing in spaces valued by other members of the scientific community. As science consumers, they wanted to make sure that the studies elaborated by other scientists were evaluated with competence.2 The decisions taken by Oldenburg and the Council of the Royal Society to evaluate the quality of the content published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society constituted the foundations of peer review.2 Throughout the history of scholarly publishing, the peer-review process has typically been done by a small community of peers. These peers are defined in literature as “experienced researchers”3 and selected by the editors based on criteria such as academic seniority, academic degree, involvement […]

AB  - Open access combined with Web 2.0 networking tools is fast changing the traditional journal’s functions and framework and the publisher’s role. As content is more and more available online in digital repositories and on the web, an integrated, interconnected, multidisciplinary information environment is evolving and Oldenburg’s model disintegrates: the journal is no longer the main referring unit for scholarly output, as it used to be, for Scientific, Technical, and Medical disciplines, but scholars’ attention is now more focused on the article level. New journals models are thus evolving. The first part of this paper discusses these new experimental journal models, i.e. overlay journals, interjournals and different levels journals. The second part directs readers’ attention to the role commercial publishers could play in this digital seamless writing arena. The authors consider that publishers should concentrate much more on value-added services for authors, readers and libraries, such as navigational services, discovery services, archiving and evaluation services.

AB  - This study identified nearly 700 English-language refereed journals in education and psychology that were founded in 2000–2009. Part one discusses the publishers, format, open-access availability, and current status of these publications. Titles were then searched against coverage lists of EBSCO Academic Search Complete, Gale Academic OneFile, ProQuest Central, ERIC, PsycINFO, Web of Science, DOAJ, Google Scholar, WorldCAT, and the library catalogs of the “Big Ten” universities to determine whether databases and libraries include these new publications. Subscription database coverage was poor, ranging from 8.8 percent (ProQuest Central) to 42.0 percent (PsycINFO). Psychology materials were heavily favored over education items in several databases. Although some library catalogs provide better title-level coverage, they are unable to search individual articles. Google Scholar only indexed the publishers’ versions of the journals in 143 (58.0%) of 247 cases examined. Significant differences in database coverage and library holdings were found when comparing publications of major corporations (Elsevier, Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis, Sage, Springer, and Wiley) against periodicals produced by smaller companies, colleges/universities, and scholarly/professional organizations. This article also describes a “ubiquity index” devised by the author to identify approximately 70 “journals of the decade” based on database coverage and library holdings. The study provides much cause for concern about the comprehensiveness and currency of existing discovery tools. It also offers evidence that the relationship between libraries and publishing conglomerates deserves further examination.

AB  - Altmetrics were born from a desire to see and measure research impact differently. Complementing traditional citation analysis, altmetrics are intended to reflect more broad views of research impact by taking into account the use of digital scholarly communication tools. Aggregating online attention paid to individual scholarly articles and data sets is the approach taken by Altmetric LLP, an altmetrics tool provider. Potential uses for article-level metrics collected by Altmetric include: 1) the assessment of an article's impact within a particular community, 2) the assessment of the overall impact of a body of scholarly work, and 3) the characterization of entire author and reader communities that engage with particular articles online. Although attention metrics are still being refined, qualitative altmetrics data are beginning to illustrate the rich new world of scholarly communication, and are emerging as ways to highlight the immediate societal impacts of research.

AB  - The motivations for an author to choose a journal to submit to are complex and include factors relating to impact and prestige, service quality, and publication costs and policies. Authors require information about multiple characteristics of journals that may be difficult to obtain. This article compares and contrasts the new author‐oriented journal comparison tools and services that have emerged to assist researchers in this important step of the scholarly publishing process. Many of these tools combine factors to provide full web‐based manuscript submission decision tools; however, they all have limitations that reduce their usefulness.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess current developments in scholarly publishing in Europe. Current models for disseminating content have limitations and Open Access models of publishing have been endorsed by the European Universities Association. The Harvard mandate for the deposit of materials in Open Access repositories is a bold new development, and the community is watching it with interest. It is possible that e-books may be the next large form of content to be made available to the user. Users certainly express interest in using this form of material. However, current library systems need to be developed in order to cope with this mass of new content. E-theses, available in Open Access from institutional repositories, are a form of content that is made much more visible than the paper equivalents. The DART-Europe portal, supported by LIBER (Association of European Research Libraries) currently provides access to 100,000 research theses in 150 European Universities. At an institutional and academic level, however, much remains to be done to embed Open Access into the landscape: the current situation is described in a new report for UCL (University College London), produced by RAND Europe.

AB  - Peer review constitutes a core component of scholarly publishing; yet it demands substantial expertise and training, and is susceptible to errors and biases. Various applications of NLP for peer reviewing assistance aim to support reviewers in this complex process, but the lack of clearly licensed datasets and multi-domain corpora prevent the systematic study of NLP for peer review. To remedy this, we introduce NLPeer– the first ethically sourced multidomain corpus of more than 5k papers and 11k review reports from five different venues. In addition to the new datasets of paper drafts, camera-ready versions and peer reviews from the NLP community, we establish a unified data representation and augment previous peer review datasets to include parsed and structured paper representations, rich metadata and versioning information. We complement our resource with implementations and analysis of three reviewing assistance tasks, including a novel guided skimming task.Our work paves the path towards systematic, multi-faceted, evidence-based study of peer review in NLP and beyond. The data and code are publicly available.

AB  - Collection development in medium to large academic libraries typically involves multiple subject librarians or “liaisons.” The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Libraries have lost significant numbers of personnel in the last four years due to attrition and retirements, including most of the professional liaison librarians whose positions will not be replaced in the foreseeable future. In addition to this challenge, collection budgets have been severely reduced due to the State of Alaska's ongoing budget crisis, necessitating large cancellation projects. This article examines UAF Libraries’ collection strategies used to sustain a research-intensive collection without liaisons and with a drastically reduced budget.

The process would start by creating public and private keys, which could be managed using digital wallet software. After creating a genesis block, nodes would submit either a new record or modifications to a single record for validation. Validation would rely on a Federated Byzantine Agreement consensus algorithm because it offers the most flexibility for institutions to select authoritative peers. Only the top tier nodes would be required to store a copy of the entire blockchain thereby allowing other institutions to decide whether they prefer to use the abridged version or the full version.

C1  - Faculty of Business & Finance, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia
AB  - It has become a common trend among academic professionals to check listing/ranking of academic journals in recognized journal ranking/quality lists before submitting their articles for review and possible publication.In addition, professional research evaluation committees in universities often consult many quality journals ranking lists.Although a majority of scholars/institutions consider forprofit indexing/abstracting databases like SSCI, SCI, Scopus, IBSS, PsycINFO etc. to assess quality of journals, this article focuses on the not-for-profit academic journal quality/ranking lists developed by various institutions or governments.This editorial presents a review of select journal quality lists produced by not-for-profit organizations because academic products developed by for-profit companies always reflect some degree of bias (Krimsky, 2013).Therefore, the lists/rankings like Clarivate Analytics (formerly Thomson Reuters) journal ranking, Cabell's journals list, SCImago journal ranking (although it is free but it harvests data from for-profit database Scopus) will be excluded.There are various academic journal ranking lists available in the market.For instance, Google Scholar provides a free list of top 100 multidisciplinary publications (Google Scholar, n.d.).This list is based on h5-index.Publications having higher h5-index are ranked higher.This list may be useful for scholars but has a very limited scope because it is not possible for every research scholar to publish in these top 100 publications.Secondly, this list excludes (or journals in these areas may not have reached to the desired h5-index value) many science and art areas for example, fine arts, music, astronomy, business, management etc.Similarly, Financial Times (FT) also calculates academic journal rankings and provides a list of top 50 academic journals for free (Ormans, 2016).Again, the scope of this list is limited because it only provides 50 journals in the areas of management and business.Hence, FT journal list is not very useful for scholars from other academic disciplines just like

AB  - This paper reports a survey on citation behaviour of Malaysian researchers. It is part of a wider study gauging quality and trustworthiness in scholarly communication in the emerging digital environment. The survey questionnaire was distributed between 1 October 2014 and 31 January 2015. A total of 391 respondents, from four research areas (humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences) completed the questionnaire. The finding indicated that motivations for citing were complex and multi‐faceted, but in all four disciplines, researchers cite a work because they regard it as an authoritative and trustworthy source, which provides a context or building block to their own research. Although researchers have moved from a print‐based system to a digital one, it has not significantly changed the way they decide what to trust. Peer reviewed journals are still the most influential. Open access journals will be cited if they have been peer reviewed. Citing on the basis of high altmetrics and other social judgements, such as mentions, likes, and use, was not prevalent. Measures of establishing trust and authority do not seem to have changed profoundly in Malaysia.

AB  - The paper presents NTNU’s contribution to SemEval-2018 Task 7 on relation identification and classification. The class weights and parameters of five alternative supervised classifiers were optimized through grid search and cross-validation. The outputs of the classifiers were combined through voting for the final prediction. A wide variety of features were explored, with the most informative identified by feature selection. The best setting achieved F1 scores of 47.4% and 66.0% in the relation classification subtasks 1.1 and 1.2. For relation identification and classification in subtask 2, it achieved F1 scores of 33.9% and 17.0%,

AB  - Each fiscal year, as academic librarians throughout the United States prepare materials budgets, a national “groan” ensues. Regardless of their format (i.e. print or digital), serial subscription costs are escalating, in the process impacting the role of the library in advancing scholarly communication . This paper examines some of the economic issues concerning open-access (OA) journal publishing. The importance of quantitative literacy is suggested for librarians and academics seeking a better understanding of alternatives to traditional journal subscription models and to anyone considering ventures into OA publishing. Quantitative literacy is essential for managing alternatives to the rising cost of scholarly communication.

AB  - ABSTRACT For over 200 years copyright law has enabled, and scholars and their publishers have depended on, a state‐granted monopoly, creating ‘artificial scarcity’ to give publishers a period during which they can charge higher prices than the market would otherwise dictate and thus recover their costs, plus (usually) a profit. But today we have instant access to digital works, and easy, worldwide distribution for almost no cost to the reader beyond those of computers, Internet access, and electricity. The monopolistic mechanism of ‘artificial scarcity’ now turns one of the most critical advantages of the digital world into something to be fought tooth and nail. The solution is not stronger and longer copyrights. It more likely will emerge from experimentation to find business models that can fund the creation of works, still a costly undertaking, without sacrificing the digital benefit of almost free distribution to everyone who might desire to access them.

AB  - The University Libraries at Virginia Tech established an Open Access Subvention Fund (OASF) in August 2012. Although it began as a two-year pilot project, the Fund has continued to the present. Anyone at Virginia Tech is eligible to apply for funding to offset the cost of an article processing charge to publish in an open access journal. To learn more about user perceptions of the OASF and open access in general, we surveyed everyone who had requested support. The survey, conducted during the fall of 2019, provided a means to gauge the needs of our users, seek feedback on the request and award process, and gather input on the fund guidelines. In this article, we review our findings in the hope that the lessons learned will be useful to other libraries in assessing similar open access subvention funds.

AB  - The role of librarians in the development and promotion of institutional repositories is discussed. It is presented as a continuation of their existing functions of acquiring, organising and making readily available the resources needed by academic staff and students. Library staff are collaborating with IT staff and academics to disseminate scholarly material and learning objects emanating from their institutions. The Open Archives Initiative and its Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, which provide the technical structure to support the repositories and enable their interoperability for searching purposes, are discussed. The benefits to institutions and their staffs are also reported. The skills needed by library staff are outlined, as well as the pitfalls and problems they may face in persuading academic staff of the virtues of institutional repositories.

AB  - While librarians, researchers, and the general public have embraced the concept of Open Access (OA), librarians still have a difficult time managing OA resources. To find out why, Bulock and Hosburgh surveyed librarians about their experiences managing OA resources and the strengths and weaknesses of management systems. At this session, they shared survey results, reflected on OA workflows at their own libraries, and updated audience members on relevant standards and initiatives. Survey respondents reported challenges related to hybrid OA, inaccurate metadata, and inconsistent communication along the serials supply chain. Recommended solutions included the creation of consistent, centralized article-level metadata and the development of OA collection development principles for libraries.

AB  - The complexity of usage reporting for Open Access (OA) content continues to grow, particularly with content syndication to organizations such as ScienceDirect and ResearchGate, which deliver content across multiple platforms at an unprecedented scale. What kind of usage data do diverse stakeholders (including libraries, publishers, authors, and editors) need? Can the work done to support OA book usage data analytics use cases inform OA article and data use cases? What standards and policies are required to ensure the usage data is accurate and meaningful? What infrastructure is needed to collect and disseminate this data effectively and efficiently? This paper brings together four different perspectives to consider these questions: an OA publisher, a research infrastructure, an emerging usage data trust, and a usage analytics service provider. The authors walk through what is known, and then start to unpack the questions for which they do not yet have answers. Their goal is to inform the community’s understanding of the challenges ahead and, hopefully, start to lay the groundwork for constructive policies and shared solutions.

AB  - Although institutional affiliation is not mandatory in scholarly publishing, a new trend of multiple and simultaneous affiliations, which I will call “octopus affiliations” or “octaffiliations” in short, is increasingly noticeable as a distorted consequence of academic ranking and evaluation systems. Institutions offer financial and/or technical supports to authors whose contributions are, in turn, used as a hallmark of productivity, influence, visibility and reputation of their affiliations at national and international levels. While it is understandable that an author can be affiliated with one or two institutions at a time, multiple and simultaneous affiliations, on the other hand, would be hardly realistic.

AB  - In response to rising tuition, state disinvestment, and financial uncertainty over the years, open educational resources (OER) have been introduced as a solution to address the college affordability crisis (Colvard et al., 2018). The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) sees OER as not just a way to lift the financial burden of educational materials, but also as a path to improving teaching and learning, strengthening the economy, advancing societal goals, and breaking down barriers to education (SPARC, n.d.-b). State policymakers have created grant programs or other initiatives to incentivize the creation, use, or expansion of OER in an effort to decrease costs associated with postsecondary education. This raises the question of how state policy discourse defines the problem that then informs the solutions addressed in OER legislation and how introducing an equity discourse into OER policy making can strengthen efforts to remove barriers to higher education.

AB  - Abstract This article presents the results of the Latin American Observatory of eVAluation Indicators (OLIVA, its Spanish acronym) which aims to contribute to the visibility of indexed scientific output in Latin America and the Caribbean and enhance its value in evaluation systems. This study addresses the production published in open access by journals indexed in SciELO and Redalyc, based on a single database of a total of 1,720 journals (from 15 countries), 908,982 documents and 2,591,704 authors. It also highlights its disciplinary diversity, and trends in national and international research collaboration. Finally, only for the case of Brazil and SciELO, intranational collaboration is analyzed. The study concludes that there is a predominance of diamond journals, of university publishing institutions and of multiscalar forms of circulation. These characteristics, even with linguistic and disciplinary diversity, can contribute very effectively to the current needs of science communication in times of open science.

These databases expose the information via public REST API's. We focused on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), iDigBio, and PlutoF, and utilized their API's to import occurrence or specimen records directly into a manuscript edited in the ARPHA Writing Tool (AWT). Furthermore, major ecological and biological databases around the world provide information about their datasets in the form of EML. A workflow was developed for creating data paper manuscripts in AWT from EML files. Such files could be downloaded, for example, from GBIF, DataONE, or the Long-Term Ecological Research Network (LTER Network).

AB  - We studied journal articles published by researchers at all eight New Zealand universities in 2017 to determine how many were freely accessible on the web. We wrote software code to harvest data from multiple sources, code that we now share to enable others to reproduce our work on their own sample set. In May 2019, we ran our code to determine which of the 2017 articles were open at that time and by what method; where those articles would have incurred an Article Processing Charge (APC) we calculated the cost if those charges had been paid. Where articles were not freely available we determined whether the policies of publishers in each case would have allowed deposit in a non-commercial repository (Green open access). We also examined citation rates for different types of access. We found that, of our 2017 sample set, about two out of every five articles were freely accessible without payment or subscription (41%). Where research was explicitly said to be funded by New Zealand’s major research funding agencies, the proportion was slightly higher at 45%. Where open articles would have incurred an APC we estimated an average cost per article of USD1,682 (for publications where all articles require an APC, that is, Gold open access) and USD2,558 (where APC payment is optional, Hybrid open access) at a total estimated cost of USD1.45m. Of the paid options, Gold is by far more common for New Zealand researchers (82% Gold, 18% Hybrid). In terms of citations, our analysis aligned with previous studies that suggest a correlation between publications being freely accessible and, on balance, slightly higher rates of citation. This is not seen across all types of open access, however, with Diamond OA achieving the lowest rates. Where articles were not freely accessible we found that a very large majority of them (88% or 3089 publications) could have been legally deposited in an institutional repository. Similarly, only in a very small number of cases had a version deposited in the repository of a New Zealand university made the difference between the publication being freely accessible or not (125 publications). Given that most New Zealand researchers support research being open, there is clearly a large gap between belief and practice in New Zealand’s research ecosystem.

AB  - Amidst the ever-expanding realm of scientific production and the proliferation of predatory journals, the focus on peer review remains paramount for scientometricians and sociologists of science. Despite this attention, there is a notable scarcity of empirical investigations into the tangible impact of peer review on publication quality. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of how peer review contributes to the quality of scholarly publications, as measured by the citations they receive.Utilizing an adjusted dataset comprising 57,482 publications from Publons to Web of Science and employing the Raking Ratio method, our study reveals intriguing insights. Specifically, our findings shed light on a nuanced relationship between the length of reviewer reports and the subsequent citations received by publications. Through a robust regression analysis, we establish that, beginning from 947 words, the length of reviewer reports is significantly associated with an increase in citations.These results not only confirm the initial hypothesis that longer reports indicate requested improvements, thereby enhancing the quality and visibility of articles, but also underscore the importance of timely and comprehensive reviewer reports. Furthermore, insights from Publons' data suggest that open access to reports can influence reviewer behavior, encouraging more detailed reports.Beyond the scholarly landscape, our findings prompt a reevaluation of the role of reviewers, emphasizing the need to recognize and value this resource-intensive yet underappreciated activity in institutional evaluations. Additionally, the study sounds a cautionary note regarding the challenges faced by peer review in the context of an increasing volume of submissions, potentially compromising the vigilance of peers in swiftly assessing numerous articles.

AB  - Abstract The push to implement Open Access (OA) as the new standard for academic research dissemination is creating very real pressures on academic journals. In Canada, the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) recently adopted a policy requiring that journals applying for its Aid to Scholarly Journals (ASJ) grant make their scholarly content freely accessible after no more than a 12-month delay. For journals such as the Canadian Journal of Political Science ( CJPS ) that not only publish high-quality, peer-reviewed articles to a specialized audience but also support the work of scholarly associations through the revenues they generate, the push to move to OA comes with a number of challenges. The Canadian Political Science Association (CPSA) and the Société québécoise de science politique (SQSP) established a committee to chart the best course of action for the CJPS in light of this changing landscape. This article summarizes the key findings of the committee and underscores some of the challenges of OA for journals with a profile similar to the CJPS , as well as for the broader research ecosystem that they support.

AB  - The author reviews past work with Ibict and the global progress made by the Open Access Movement. He postulates a theory of open access being an example of a complex adaptive system created by Internet-based scholarly publishing. Open access could be the cause of a cascade of increasing complexity and opportunities that will reshape this system. He has chosen the pervasive and global “Connectedness” created by the internet and the content spaces it provides for open access collections as a “simple disruptive agent”. He discusses how connectedness influences infinite variety, creativity, work, change, knowledge, and the information economy. Case studies from the University of New Mexico Libraries are used where appropriate. Keywords Digital libraries. Open access. Open archives. Scholarly publishing. Institutional repositories. Complex adaptive systems. Connectedness. Complexity. Social software. Acesso aberto e conexidade: estimulando inovações inesperadas com o uso de arquivos abertos institucionais Resumo O autor revisa um trabalho passado feito com o Ibict e o progresso mundial do Movimento de Acesso Aberto. Ele apresenta e defende a teoria de que o acesso aberto é um sistema adaptativo complexo criado a partir da publicação acadêmica utilizando a Internet. O acesso aberto poderia ser a causa de uma cascata de complexidade crescente que leva a oportunidades que modificarão o sistema. Ele escolheu a conexidade global que se espalha, criada pela Internet e pelos espaços de conteúdo que ela proporciona para coleções abertas, como um ‘agente simples para quebras do status quo’. Ele discute a influência da conexidade nas infinitas variedades, na criatividade, no trabalho, na mudança, no conhecimento e na economia da informação.

AB  - The popularity of open access (OA) publications has increased in recent years. This situation leads to several pertinent questions for academic libraries: Is the rapid expansion of OA availability negatively affecting their COUNTER usage reports? And, as a consequence, is the increasing accessibility of OA publications prompting academic libraries to reconsider their subscriptions to traditional, subscription-based resources? The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of hybrid OA growth on Denison University’s subscribed e-resource usage and to illuminate the potential effects of OA on academic library subscriptions.

AB  - The open access movement in Canada is very active in many areas. This is not surprising; of the 16 people at the Budapest meeting which was the foundation of the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI), three were Canadians, all global leaders in this arena: Leslie Chan, Jean-Claude Guedon, and Stevan Harnad. The Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL) was among the earliest signatories of the BOAI, and quickly initiated a nationwide institutional repository program. The Canadian Library Association (CLA) recently approved an innovative “Position Statement on Open Access for Canadian Libraries,” calling for all libraries to participate in advocacy, educating patrons abut open access resources, and encouraging support for open access, including economic support. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has an open access mandate policy, requiring open access to CIHR-funded research within six months. The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) has an Aid to Open Access Journals program. Other funding agencies in Canada either have, or are developing, open access policies and support. This article presents an overview of CLA advocacy and open access in Canada, with a focus on initiatives with a strong library involvement or leadership.

AB  - With the emergence of advanced Internet technologies, access to scientific literature is evolving at an unprecedented pace. While the number of peer-reviewed publications is growing exponentially, unpublished technical reports, dissertations and other forms of grey literature are becoming increasingly accessible for researchers across the world. Research organizations and universities are capitalizing on this opportunity, actively making their research available on the Internet. At the National Research Council, the Institute for Research in Construction ensures that all fire-related literature produced is stored in an Institutional Repository and posted on the Web in a freely available manner. In doing so, this system has provided fire researchers with a vehicle to improve visibility of their research, having pronounced advantages. For the fire community, the material is an excellent source of scholarly articles, reports, technical data and conference papers. A close examination of the Institute’s fire-related literature in Google Scholar reveals citation patterns which illustrate the value of open-access, free literature to fire researchers.

AB  - Open Access and the Big Deal are often thought to occupy opposite ends of the spectrum of openness in scholarly publishing. Universities in the Netherlands are changing that by negotiating OA publishing services into their Big Deals. This has been successfully arranged with three publishers already, and negotiations continue with Elsevier. While there are precedents for converting subscription payments to OA payments, such as the Sponsoring Coalition for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics, this new arrangement could have a big impact. The deal has the potential to quickly convert a large number of articles from toll access to OA and to do so without dramatically disturbing the scholarly publishing ecosystem. There are questions about its sustainability and scalability, but it's a project worth watching.

AB  - This paper outlines the UK publishing landscape for the social and political sciences, with particular reference to academic journals. The changes and challenges being brought to this environment by open access (OA) are described and the response of UK publishers examined. While some of the initial caution among publishers towards OA in the social and political sciences is beginning to recede, the pressures of funding, perception and engagement remain considerable. Despite scepticism from some quarters about the future role of so-called 'legacy' publishers, it is argued that their skills, knowledge and innovation will make them a valuable part of the evolving, and ever more varied, scholarly communications arena.

AB  - Access to research results is imperative in today's robust digital age, yet access is often prevented by publisher paywalls.Open Access (OA) is the simple idea that all research should be free for all to access, use, and build upon.This paper will focus on three critical areas of the OA landscape: its impact on scholarship and the public, the obstacles to be overcome, and its advancements.The impact of OA actions and initiatives has been difficult to quantify, but the growing number of studies on OA have shown mostly overwhelmingly positive results.Cultural norms within academia, such as the reliance on the journal Impact Factor (IF) to assess the quality of individual research articles, have impeded the progress of OA.Conversely, federal mandates and institutional policies have supported the OA movement by requiring that scholarly publications be deposited into institutional or subject repositories immediately following publication.As information professionals, library and information science (LIS) professionals have a responsibility as practitioners, authors, and editors to support OA and encourage other academics to do the same.

AB  - The move from subscription only publishing of scholarly articles to open access has been much slower than previously anticipated by many Open Access (OA) advocates. Despite the many advantages that OA offers, this particular branch of E-commerce imposes several formidable barriers to change. A framework conceptualizing these barriers that was developed over a decade ago was revisited to see if the significance of these barriers has changed. Nowadays, building the IT infrastructure, support from indexing services and finding a sustainable business model are no longer important barriers. For gold OA publishing the academic reward system is still a major obstacle, whereas more marketing and critical mass is needed for both gold OA and green OA. Green OA self-archiving is still also strongly affected by what subscription publishers allow. In the overall balance the situation has nevertheless improved significantly.

AB  - As of May 2014, the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) listed close to ten thousand fully open access, peer reviewed, scholarly journals. Most of these journals do not charge article processing charges (APCs). This article reports the results of a survey of the 2567 journals, or 26% of journals listed in DOAJ, that do have APCs based on a sample of 1432 of these journals. Results indicate a volatile sector that would make future APCs difficult to predict for budgeting purposes. DOAJ and publisher title lists often did not closely match. A number of journals were found on examination not to have APCs. A wide range of publication costs was found for every publisher type. The average (mean) APC of $964 contrasts with a mode of $0. At least 61% of publishers using APCs are commercial in nature, while many publishers are of unknown types. The vast majority of journals charging APCs (80%) were found to offer one or more variations on pricing, such as discounts for authors from mid to low income countries, differential pricing based on article type, institutional or society membership, and/or optional charges for extras such as English language editing services or fast track of articles. The complexity and volatility of this publishing landscape is discussed.

AB  - This article documents Open access article processing charges (OA APC) longitudinal study 2015 preliminary dataset available for download from the OA APC dataverse [1]. This dataset was gathered as part of Sustaining the Knowledge Commons (SKC), a research program funded by Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. The overall goal of SKC is to advance our collective knowledge about how to transition scholarly publishing from a system dependent on subscriptions and purchase to one that is fully open access. The OA APC preliminary data 2015 Version 12 dataset was developed as one of the lines of research of SKC, a longitudinal study of the minority (about a third) of the fully open access journals that use this business model. The original idea was to gather data during an annual two-week census period. The volume of data and growth in this area makes this an impractical goal. For this reason, we are posting this preliminary dataset in case it might be helpful to others working in this area. Future data gathering and analyses will be conducted on an ongoing basis. We encourage others to share their data as well. In order to merge datasets, note that the two most critical elements for matching data and merging datasets are the journal title and ISSN.

AB  - A review of:&#x0D; &#x0D; Antelman, Kristin. “Do Open-Access Articles Have a Greater Research Impact?” College &amp; Research Libraries 65.5 (Sep. 2004): 372-82.&#x0D; &#x0D; Objective – To ascertain whether open access articles have a greater research impact than articles not freely available, as measured by citations in the ISI Web of Science database.&#x0D; &#x0D; Design – Analysis of mean citation rates of a sample population of journal articles across four disciplines.&#x0D; &#x0D; Setting – Journal literature across the disciplines of philosophy, political science, mathematics, and electrical and electronic engineering.&#x0D; &#x0D; Subjects – A sample of 2,017 articles across the four disciplines published between 2001 and 2002 (for political science, mathematics, and electrical and electronic engineering) and between 1999 and 2000 (for philosophy). &#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – A systematic presample of articles for each of the disciplines was taken to calculate the necessary sample sizes. Based on this calculation, articles were sourced from ten leading journals in each discipline. The leading journals in political science, mathematics, and electrical and electronic engineering were defined by ISI’s Journal Citation Reports for 2002. The ten leading philosophy journals were selected using a combination of other methods.&#x0D; &#x0D; Once the sample population had been identified, each article title and the number of citations to each article (in the ISI Web of Science database) were recorded. Then the article title was searched in Google and if any freely available full text version was found, the article was classified as open access. The mean citation rate for open access and non-open access articles in each discipline was identified, and the percentage difference between the means was calculated.&#x0D; &#x0D; Main results – The four disciplines represented a range of open access uptake: 17% of articles in philosophy were open access, 29% in political science, 37% in electrical and electronic engineering, and 69% in mathematics. There was a significant difference in the mean citation rates for open access articles and non-open access articles in all four disciplines. The percentage difference in means was 45% in philosophy, 51% in electrical and electronic engineering, 86% in political science, and 91% in mathematics. Mathematics had the highest rate of open access availability of articles, but political science had the greatest difference in mean citation rates, suggesting there are other, discipline-specific factors apart from rate of open access uptake affecting research impact.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion – The finding that, across these four disciplines, open access articles have a greater research impact than non-open access articles, is only one aspect of the complex changes that are presently taking place in scholarly publishing and communication. However, it is useful information for librarians formulating strategies for building institutional repositories, or exploring open access publishing with patrons or publishers.&#x0D;

AB  - The accumulation of evidence that open access publishing can increase citation rates highlights one benefit of universal accessibility to scholarly works. However, studies investigating the effect of open access publishing on citations are typically conducted across a wide variety of journals and disciplines, introducing a number of potential issues and limiting their utility for specific disciplines. Here, I used three primary marine ecology journals with an open access option as a “microcosm” of scientific publishing to determine whether or not open access articles received more citations than non-open access articles during the same time frame, controlling for self-citations, article type, and journal impact factor. I also tested for the effects of time since publication and the number of authors. Citations were positively correlated with time since publication and differed across the three journals. In addition, open access articles received significantly more citations than non-open access articles. Self-citations increased with author number and were affected by a complex interaction between open access, journal, and time since publication. This study demonstrates that open access articles receive more citations in hybrid marine ecology journals, although the causal factors driving this trend are unknown.

AB  - The open access movement has gained momentum since the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) first launched twenty years ago. Notably, there has been a drastic increase in the number of open access articles. Concerns have been raised about equality and diversity issues, however, for researchers without an affiliation (e.g. independent, unemployed and retired researchers) and researchers on the 'scientific periphery' who are excluded from the gold open access model. This article argues that the gold open access model is destructive to the knowledge production ecosystem by addressing the importance of bibliodiversity and the ways in which library publishing can contribute to sustainable and equitable knowledge production.

AB  - Open access (OA) has mostly been studied by relying on publication data from selective international databases, notably Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The aim of our study is to show that it is possible to achieve a national estimate of the number and share of OA based on institutional publication data providing a comprehensive coverage of the peer-reviewed outputs across fields, publication types, and languages. Our data consists of 48,177 journal, conference, and book publications from 14 Finnish universities in 2016–2017, including information about OA status, as self-reported by researchers and validated by data-collection personnel through their Current Research Information System (CRIS). We investigate the WoS, Scopus, and DOI coverage, as well as the share of OA outputs between different fields, publication types, languages, OA mechanisms (gold, hybrid, and green), and OA information sources (DOAJ, Bielefeld list, and Sherpa/Romeo). We also estimate the role of the largest international commercial publishers compared to the not-for-profit Finnish national publishers of journals and books. We conclude that institutional data, integrated at national and international level, provides one of the building blocks of a large-scale data infrastructure needed for comprehensive assessment and monitoring of OA across countries, for example at the European level.

AB  - Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Open Access Availability of Publications of Faculty in Three Engineering Disciplines Abstract The analysis presented here provides a snapshot in time of the open access online availability of the five most recent works of engineering faculty in five institutions that overall have heavily populated institutional repositories. The incentive for the study was to provide a measure of the inclination of engineering faculty in specific disciplines to provide open access to their most current manuscripts or articles. The Web of Science database was used to choose the five most recent publications for each faculty member in each of three disciplines: civil, chemical, and mechanical engineering. The study was done for the five United States universities that had the most overall content in their repositories, as ranked by the Registry of Open Access Repositories (http://roar.eprints.org) at the time of data collection. One of these universities was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as having the number one engineering college among schools whose highest degree is a doctorate. To determine open access availability of each article via deposition in an institutional repository, each publication title was searched using the ROAR Content Search interface. To determine other forms of open access a Google Scholar search was used. The results of an analysis of these data collected for various sources of open access with breakdowns by college and department are provided. Introduction Under the leadership of MIT in developing the DSpace system, institutional repositories (IRs) [long term electronic archives of works authored by affiliates of the institution] emerged in the United States in the fall of 20021. Built on the concept of open access, defined for these purposes as freely available online access to full text articles, and with discipline repositories such as arXiv, as a precursor, many were founded with the “build it and they will come” concept. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) 2, whose activities are meant in part to serve as an aid in reducing financial pressures on libraries, defines institutional repositories in terms of capturing and preserving intellectual output in their August 2002 position paper3. The paper goes on to stress the importance of open or low-barrier access and the ability to share metadata with external systems to facilitate access to the broader research community. Clifford Lynch, Executive Director, Coalition for Networked Information, defines IRs in terms of a set of management and dissemination services provided by institutions. He stresses the importance of managing technological changes by migrating digital content to assure that at least their own intellectual content is preserved. With libraries increasingly cancelling their print subscriptions in favor of somewhat less costly online only access, where are the assurances to faculty that back content will be available to them through technology changes, publisher mergers, future journal cancellations, and whatever else might transpire to cause loss of access to online content? Lynch goes on to state “that a primary responsibility of our universities is both to make these resources available and to preserve them.”1 Touting the advantages of their own IR software platform, the Digital Commons, the Berkeley Electronic Press (BePress) President and Director of Journals explains that their product expands upon the service aspect, to actually

AB  - The year 2012 heralded significant developments in open access (OA) that impacted the relationships between the major stakeholders in scholarly publishing: researchers, funders, publishers and governments. In the UK, the clear preference for a gold OA policy enunciated by the government-backed ‘Finch Report’ is now being implemented by the research councils. Although the policy has been modified to include green routes to OA publishing, arguments continue about the optimal route to a system of open access that can work on a global scale. Resolution of these disputes will require courage and imagination.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore dissemination, broadly considered, of an open access (OA) database as part of a librarian‐faculty collaboration currently in progress. Design/methodology/approach Dissemination of an online database by librarians is broadly considered, including metadata optimization for multiple access points and user notification methods. Findings Librarians address OA dissemination challenges by investigating search engine optimization and seeking new opportunities for dissemination on the web. Differences in library metadata formats inhibit metadata optimization and need resolution. Research limitations/implications The collaboration is in progress and many of the ideas and conclusions listed have not been implemented. Practical implications Libraries should consider their role in scholarly publishing, develop workflows to enable it, and extend their efforts to the web. Originality/value This paper contributes to the scant literature on dissemination by libraries, and discusses dissemination challenges encountered by a non‐peer reviewed, dynamic scholarly resource.

AB  - Background/Context The open access movement has successfully drawn attention to economic and political aspects of scholarly communication through a significant body of commentary that debates the merits of open access and the potential damage it may do to scholarly publishing. Researchers within the field of education research, notably John Willinsky, have discussed the value and potential benefits of open access to fulfill the research mission and to improve the visibility of the field. There are now thousands of open access publications or content aggregators online. Researchers have adopted open access to varying degrees, but not as rapidly as proponents have hoped, while readers using traditional discovery services are less likely to encounter open access materials in their research than they are traditionally published scholarship. Purpose This article examines the opportunities that are available for researchers to adopt open access distribution and the factors that may impede their adoption. I synthesize recent studies of researchers’ attitudes toward, and understanding of, open access and examine the extent to which influential education research journals permit it. I focus on one of the primary methods of adopting open access—archiving versions of articles in open repository services—and demonstrate how that model can contribute to decontextualizing of research findings during discovery. Research Design This article is based primarily on a literature review and analysis, but also builds on an investigation of publisher policies through publicly accessible Web sites. Conclusions and Recommendations First, the success of the movement, and the ease with which data can be readily shared by anyone with net access, has contributed to an increasing expectation of “openness” and will change how research is conducted, shared, and authorized. Second, more research is needed on the attitudes and behavior of researchers in specific fields, especially education researchers, to understand how open access can support their needs as authors. Third, that understanding should be deployed to design services that can help close gaps in the research process. Openness should be adopted as a value in these services, not an end in itself.

TI  - Open Access Escape Room: the key to OA engagement?
VL  - 32
AU  - Sundsbø, Katrine
C1  - University of Essex
AB  - Open access (OA) has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on the scholarly publishing landscape in academia, yet many academic staff publish OA in order to comply with policies, rather than engaging with the value of open scholarship and in debates that ultimately affect them. Training sessions and workshops are often arranged to increase knowledge and awareness in the academic community, but engagement is often low. On the other hand, some academic staff, who already do engage, will happily attend sessions and workshops to increase their knowledge even further. The struggle to increase OA engagement overall could be due to the training not being appealing enough, and academics not being aware of benefits until after they have attended workshops. At the University of Essex, we took a bold, brave and curious approach to increasing engagement during Open Access Week 2018, and created an OA-themed escape room. This resulted in great engagement from students, academic staff and professional services staff, some of whom reported that they never knew how relevant OA was for them. The Open Access Escape Room was a success, and provided a positive environment for conversations around OA.

AB  - In 2013 the Obama administration mandated that scientific papers reporting the results of federally funded research be freely available one year after publication. This past December rumors spread that the Trump administration is considering reducing the embargo time to zero. Although the White House has yet to confirm a new mandate, the rumors were sufficiently substantiated that two coalitions of scholarly publishers promptly sent letters to President Trump urging him to reconsider.The case for immediate open access (OA) is strong. NASA, NSF, and other federal agencies disburse research grants that are funded by US taxpayers. Tuition revenue and state taxes fund scientists at public universities. Why, having helped pay for a research project, should a US taxpayer face the choice of either waiting 12 months to read the corresponding paper or paying for prompt access?Whether immediate OA becomes mandatory will depend in part on the opposing arguments. How persuasive are they?The 18 December letter to Trump organized by the Association of American Publishers (AAP) and signed by 135 professional societies builds its case around upholding US leadership in science. While I accept that invoking patriotism is sometimes necessary when appealing to politicians, I find the practice unsavory. Science is an international enterprise.Still, how strongly is a country’s scientific prestige tied to its homegrown journals? Weakly, in my view. None of the top physics journals is Japanese, yet Japan is a physics powerhouse. In 1994 Stuttgart-based Holtzbrinck Publishing Group bought a controlling stake in London-based Macmillan Publishers, owners of Nature, arguably the world’s foremost scientific journal. Nature and its swelling number of stablemates remain under German ownership. The UK’s standing in science has not fallen nor has Germany’s risen as a result.The AAP letter asserts that peer-reviewed articles are “licensed to users in hundreds of foreign countries, supporting billions of dollars in U.S. exports.” The United Nations recognizes 195 countries. Given that “hundreds” is an exaggeration, I suspect “billions” is too. Still, the authors of the AAP letter are right to point to the economic impact of immediate OA. The question of who pays is paramount.An 18 December letter to Trump signed by 62 scholarly publishers points out that scientific societies use subscription revenue to fund worthy activities. “One particular area of importance,” the letter says, “is strengthening U.S. STEM infrastructure through education, career, and outreach programs.” The transfer of money from libraries to societies is defensible. But it seems to me unfair to expect, say, the University of Tokyo or the Max Planck Society to subsidize programs that benefit the US.In its 2018 industry overview, the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers reported that its members incur expenses of around $4000 to publish a peer-reviewed paper in an archival journal.11. R. Johnson, A. Watkinson, M. Mabe, The STM Report: An Overview of Scientific and Scholarly Publishing, International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (2018). When publishers offer authors the option to make their papers freely and instantly accessible, the fee is also around $4000. Journal subscriptions are of the same order. Online-only subscriptions to the two biggest astronomy journals by volume, Astrophysical Journal and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, cost $2175 and $10 249 a year. (ApJ levies page charges to offset publishing expenses; MNRAS does not.)With those numbers in mind, you can see how the impact of immediate OA depends on how prolific an institution’s researchers are. If an astronomy department publishes more than four or so papers a year, buying subscriptions could be cheaper than paying author fees. Kent Anderson made that point last year in The Scholarly Kitchen: The subscription model, he contends, is significantly more cost-effective than the OA model because publishing expenses are borne by both readers and authors.22. K. Anderson, “Guest Post: The Surprisingly Low Burden of Subscriptions at Institutions,” The Scholarly Kitchen (21 May 2019).Despite its advantages, the subscription model is overstretched. As diagnosed by Aileen Fyfe and her coauthors,33. A. Fyfe et al., “Untangling Academic Publishing: A History of the Relationship . . . ,” Zenodo (25 May 2017). the underlying problem is that academics are evaluated on research published in traditional journals despite the existence of alternative outlets. So they publish more, and scholarly publishers, whether for-profit or nonprofit, respond by launching more journals. Libraries’ bills keep going up.Immediate OA would bring relief to libraries and compel researchers to be more judicious in what they publish, but at what cost?ReferencesSection:ChooseTop of pageReferences <<CITING ARTICLES1.

AB  - Open access promotion methods are generally divided into the ‘gold road’ and the ‘green road.’ Asian countries most commonly focus on the gold road while others focus on the green road. According to data from the Directory of Open Access Journal and the Directory of Open Access Repositories, Indonesia has the largest number of open access journals in the world, while Japan has the third largest number of institutional repositories. In contrast, in Korea, the extensible markup language services of the original text of journal articles are more popular than other Asian countries. In this article, the current status of open access in Asian countries is investigated, and typical open access journal service platforms in Asian countries are reviewed.

AB  - Many libraries offer open access publishing funds to support authors in paying article processing charges (APC) levied by some OA journals. However, there are few standard practices for managing or assessing these funds. The Open Access Working Group (OAWG) of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL) was asked to investigate and articulate best practices for successful open access fund management. In spring 2015, the OAWG surveyed Canadian academic libraries with OA funds to review their criteria and collect feedback on current practices. The survey proved timely because many OA funds are under review. Shrinking budgets, ending pilots, and questions around scale and sustainability of funds provide context for some institutions revisiting or reconfiguring these funds. At the same time, Canada’s principal funding agencies have issued the new Tri‐Agency Open Access Policy on Publications (effective May 2015) which mandates open access for funded research and which is increasing the demand from researchers for financial support from their institutions to pay APCs and other OA costs. This paper addresses findings of the survey, some best practices for open access publishing fund management, and counter arguments for OA funds, as well as other strategies developed by international agencies including the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC).

AB  - Abstract Open access (OA) to research publications is of global relevance, both in terms of provision and consumption of scholarly content. However, much of the research, practice, and models surrounding OA have been centered around the Global North. In this study we investigate how and to what degree higher education institutions (HEIs) in Angola interact with the concept of OA to journal publications through their policies and practices, a country where the end of the civil war in 2002 marked a new start for growth in teaching and research. This study is based on an online survey conducted in 2020 among research management units of Angolan HEIs. 23 valid institutional responses were received of 44 invitations sent (52% response rate). The results suggest that Angolan HEIs have moderate awareness of OA but practical incorporation into academic processes has remained slow, however, this can be seen to be connected to the overall slow progress in ramping up research intensity in the country. Seven of the responding institutions reported to be involved in publishing scholarly journals, all of them OA. Overall Angolan HEIs have few institutional repositories, and have so far placed little value on OA in the context of academic career advancement.

AB  - Scholarly communication change and open access (OA) initiatives in Australia have followed an Odyssean path in the last decade. The stop-start nature of early initiatives demonstrates that institutional leadership is essential for the successful deposit of academic content in an institutional repository. Similarly, OA policies from the two Australian Research Councils were delayed for nearly a decade, partly due to publisher pressure and bureaucratic conservatism. More successful has been the development of full, or hybrid, open access university e-presses. These presses, usually embedded in the scholarly infrastructure of the university, provide monographic models for wider global consideration. Australian universities are now reflecting, partly through recent Research Council edicts and monitoring global OA developments, greater awareness of the need for action in scholarly communication change.

AB  - The current state of open access to journal publications within research areas belonging to the humanities has received relatively little research attention. This study provides a detailed mapping of the bibliometric state of open access to journal publications among ethicists, taking into account not only open access publishing in journals directly, but also where and in what form ethicists make their journal articles available elsewhere on the web. As part of the study 297 ethicists affiliated with top-ranking philosophy departments were identified and their journal publication information for the years 2010–2015 were recorded (1682 unique articles). The journal articles were then queried for through Google Scholar in order to establish open access status (web locations, document versions) of each publication record. Publication records belonging to the 20 most frequently used journal outlets (subset of 597 unique articles) were put under closer inspection with regards to alignment with publisher copyright restrictions as well as measuring unused potential to share articles. The results show that slightly over half of recent journal publications are available to read for free. PhilPapers and academic social networks (Academia.edu and ResearchGate) were found to be key platforms for research dissemination in ethics research. The representation of institutional repositories as providers of access was found to be weak, receiving the second lowest frequency rating among the eight discrete web location categories. Further, the study reveals that ethicists are at the same time prone to copyright infringement and undersharing their scholarly work.

AB  - Open access (OA) is often considered as particularly beneficial to researchers in the global south. However, research into awareness of and attitudes to OA has been largely dominated by voices from the global north. A survey was conducted of 507 researchers from the developing world and connected to INASP's AuthorAID project to ascertain experiences and attitudes to OA publishing. The survey revealed problems for the researchers in gaining access to research literature in the first place. There was a very positive attitude to OA research and OA journals, but when selecting a journal in which to publish, OA was seen as a much less important criterion than factors relating to international reputation. Overall, a majority of respondents had published in an OA journal and most of these had paid an article processing charge. Knowledge and use of self-archiving via repositories varied, and only around 20% had deposited their research in an institutional repository. The study also examined attitudes to copyright, revealing most respondents had heard of Creative Commons licences and were positive about the sharing of research for educational use and dissemination, but there was unease about research being used for commercial purposes. Respondents revealed a surprisingly positive stance towards openly sharing research data, although many revealed that they would need further guidance on how to do so. The survey also revealed that the majority had received emails from so called “predatory” publishers and that a small minority had published in them.

AB  - In this article we argue that the current endeavors to achieve open access in scientific literature require a discussion about innovation in scholarly publishing and research infrastructure. Drawing on path dependence theory and addressing different open access (OA) models and recent political endeavors, we argue that academia is once again running the risk of outsourcing the organization of its content.

AB  - In this paper, we locate open access in the South African higher education research context where it is, distinctively, not shaped by the policy frameworks that are profoundly changing research dissemination behaviour in other parts of the world. We define open access and account for its rise by two quite different routes. We then present a case study of journal publishing at one South African university to identify existing journal publishing practices in terms of open access. This case provides the springboard for considering the implications – both positive and negative – of global open access trends for South African – and other – research and researchers. We argue that academics’ engagement with open access and scholarly communication debates is in their interests as global networked researchers whose virtual identities and online scholarship are now a critical aspect of their professional engagement.

AU  - Quigley, Niamh

AB  - Adoption of open access in the humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS) is a work in progress, with lower engagement in HASS than most of the natural sciences. HASS research impacts how we live, how we learn and how we see ourselves, and research institutions should encourage and enable their HASS research communities to increase the prevalence of open access research outputs. Six experienced HASS researchers at a single academic institution in Perth, Australia, were interviewed to explore their perceptions and experiences of open access, and any barriers that they had encountered. Thematic analysis was used to code the transcribed interviews, and generate themes. This study found a wide variance in the adoption of open access practices among HASS researchers. Some participants are publishing via APC-based gold open access (in DOAJ listed journals), while other participants encounter multiple barriers to sharing more of their work as open access. Confusion about aspects of open access is evident. Even among participants who support open access, some have had poor experiences of open access publishing. This research also found that some participants hold extremely complex opinions on open access, which directly influence participants’ behaviour depending on which perspective they are considering. These perspectives are: research supervisor, editorial role at journal, funding assessor and global citizen. Within HASS a diversity of behaviours exists around open access, and research institutions need to tailor their research support services around open access and scholarly publishing for different communities of researchers.

AB  - The idea of “Open Access” (hereafter OA) emerged in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s with a noble goal: to provide comprehensive access to the scholarly literature for everyone around the world by making the results of scholarly research freely and immediately available online to all. After more than 20 years of OA advocacy and development, where do things stand? Has the noble goal of universal access been realized, and is the scholarly literature now accessible and open to the global community of scholars? How strong is the current OA movement and where is it headed? While significant advances have been made, to be sure, the fact is that elements of OA have taken a wrong turn somewhere, resulting in a system that is broken and has not lived up to its promise. Early OA efforts focused on the need for better access to read and reuse scholarly literature. While significant advancement has been made in this area, it has created another barrier to the free and open sharing of scholarly research–access for authors to publish their research. This is especially problematic for those without the means or support to participate in the “pay to publish” model of OA that has become dominant. There is still hope to correct this imbalance, but the scholarly community must refocus and recalibrate its efforts to get back on track.

AB  - ABSTRACT The two primary means for accomplishing Open Access (OA) goals are the "author pays" or Gold model and the "self-archiving" or Green model, both of which can have variations or hybrids. There is a growing schism between proponents of the Gold and Green models. Scholar uptake on self-archiving has been very limited. At the same time, a great deal of concern has been expressed regarding the Gold model, particularly with regard to cost and the role of peer-review lite journals. With the evolving OA environment as a backdrop, the authors conducted a survey of university engineering faculty in order to better understand their OA practices and attitudes. The scholarly communication needs and activities of engineering faculty are more diverse than other scholars in that they have a broader and more varied literature, which includes journal articles, conference papers, technical reports, standards, handbook information, patents, and grey literature. The survey was comprised of 12 Likert scale questions and 3 open comment questions. The results of the survey of engineering faculty were consistent with other studies that have revealed concerns over the author pays model and a reluctance to self-archive in the university institutional repository (IR). Survey results showed that engineering faculty do not extensively publish in author pays Gold journals and had limited plans to do so in the future. In line with other studies, the survey revealed that there was a lack of familiarity with campus IRs and a very small uptake rate for depositing research output in institutional repositories.

AB  - The number of open access (OA) journals and their share of all scholarly journals are usually estimated based on indexing in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). DOAJ's coverage of OA journals from different regions of the world is, however, far from complete, particularly of journals publishing in languages other than English. Using alternative data sources for identification and manual verification, 437 scholarly OA journals published in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) were identified, and some key characteristics were studied. Of these, only 184 were indexed in DOAJ. A vast majority of the journals was published by scholarly societies or universities. Social sciences and humanities dominated as topics, and few journals charge authors. National or university‐specific OJS portals have played a major role in enabling OA publishing. Around a third of the Nordic scholarly journals are currently OA.

AB  - The scholarly publication model is discussed and the impact of the current technological change on knowledge and communication generally on the scholarly publication model is set out. The proposal is made that rather than open access being the cause of the apparent and impending collapse of the scholarly publication industry, it is but one driver of a far wider change in scholarly publication. That change will have effects that extend well beyond the simple decision of whether a publication should be available by subscription or by one of the forms of open access. A number of other changes to scholarly publication are also itemized. The change is inevitable but its extent is as yet unclear.

AB  - Accessing quality research when not part of an academic institution can be challenging. Dating back to the 1980s, open access (OA) was a response to journal publishers who restricted access to publications by requiring a subscription and limited access to knowledge. Although the OA movement seeks to remove costly barriers to accessing research, especially when funded by state and federal governments, it remains the subject of continuous debates. After providing a brief overview of OA, this article summarizes OA statutory and regulatory developments at the federal and state levels regarding free and open access to research. It compares similarities and differences among enacted and proposed legislation and describes the advantages and disadvantages of these laws. It analyzes the effects of these laws in higher education, especially on university faculty regarding tenure and promotion decisions as well as intellectual property rights to provide recommendations and best practices regarding the future of legislation and regulation in the United States.

AB  - Purpose Open-access mega-journals (OAMJs) represent an increasingly important part of the scholarly communication landscape. OAMJs, such as PLOS ONE , are large scale, broad scope journals that operate an open access business model (normally based on article-processing charges), and which employ a novel form of peer review, focussing on scientific “soundness” and eschewing judgement of novelty or importance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the discourses relating to OAMJs, and their place within scholarly publishing, and considers attitudes towards mega-journals within the academic community. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a review of the literature of OAMJs structured around four defining characteristics: scale, disciplinary scope, peer review policy, and economic model. The existing scholarly literature was augmented by searches of more informal outputs, such as blogs and e-mail discussion lists, to capture the debate in its entirety. Findings While the academic literature relating specifically to OAMJs is relatively sparse, discussion in other fora is detailed and animated, with debates ranging from the sustainability and ethics of the mega-journal model, to the impact of soundness-only peer review on article quality and discoverability, and the potential for OAMJs to represent a paradigm-shifting development in scholarly publishing. Originality/value This paper represents the first comprehensive review of the mega-journal phenomenon, drawing not only on the published academic literature, but also grey, professional and informal sources. The paper advances a number of ways in which the role of OAMJs in the scholarly communication environment can be conceptualised.

AB  - This paper is the first of two Learned Publishing articles in which we report the results of a series of interviews with senior publishers and editors exploring open access megajournals ( OAMJs ). Megajournals (of which PLoS One is the best known example) represent a relatively new approach to scholarly communication and can be characterized as large, broad‐scope, open access journals that take an innovative approach to peer review, basing acceptance decisions solely on the technical or scientific soundness of the article. This model is often said to support the broader goals of the open science movement. Based on in‐depth interviews with 31 publishers and editors representing 16 different organizations (10 of which publish a megajournal), this paper reports how the term ‘megajournal’ is understood and publishers’ rationale and motivations for launching (or not launching) an OAMJ . We find that while there is general agreement on the common characteristics of megajournals, there is not yet a consensus on their relative importance. We also find seven motivating factors that were said to drive the launch of an OAMJ and link each of these factors to potential societal and business benefits. These results suggest that the often polarized debate surrounding OAMJs is a consequence of the extent to which observers perceive publishers to be motivated by these societal or business benefits.

AB  - The UK Research and Innovation funding council announced its latest Open Access Policy on August 6, 2021. This policy applies to all UKRI funded research, and thus constitutes a significant move towards OA as an academic standard. For the first time in the UK, OA is to be mandated for academic books – this means that both monographs and edited chaptered books must be published Open Access from January 2024, though a 1 year embargo is permissible. As the infrastructures, business models and workflows supporting OA book publishing are currently lagging behind journals, especially in the Arts and Humanities, many researchers and institutions have responded to the policy with some consternation, even whilst supporting the aims and ethics of OA publishing. This article explores some of these apprehensions and questions raised by institutions, academics and by librarians regarding OA book publishing in a UK context, especially regarding funding and sustainability. It aims to dispel certain myths around OA book publishing in general, particularly the notion that Book Processing Charges are a necessary or even desirable element. The article then presents some of the varied models and systems currently in use and development, particularly the work of the UKRI/Research England funded COPIM project (Community- Led Open Access Infrastructures for Monographs), one of the aims of which is to build ways of delivering more sustainable revenue sources to OA publishers. It focuses in particular a key and soon to be launched output of the project: the Open Book Collective.

AB  - Open access is a scholarly publishing model that has emerged as an alternative to traditional subscription-based journal publishing. This study explores the adoption of the open access movement worldwide and the role that libraries can play in addressing those factors which are slowing its progress within developing countries. The study has drawn upon both qualitative data from a focused literature review and quantitative data from major open access platforms. The results indicate that while the open access movement is steadily gaining acceptance worldwide, the progress in developing countries within geographical areas such as Africa, Asia and Oceania is quite a bit slower. Two significant factors are the cost of publishing fees and the lack of institutional open access mandates and policies to encourage uptake. The study provides suggested strategies for academic libraries to help overcome current challenges.

AB  - Open access (OA) publications play an important role for academia, policy-makers, and practitioners. Universities and research institutions set up OA policies and provide authors different types of support for engaging in OA activities. This paper presents a case study on OA publishing in a scholarly community, drawing on qualitative and quantitative data gained from workshops and a survey. As the authors are the managing editors of the OA eJournal for eDemocracy and Open Government (JeDEM), the aim was to collect data and insights on the publication choices of authors interested in OA publishing and other crucial factors such as personal attitudes to publishing, institutional context, and digital literacy in order to improve the journal. In the first phase, two workshops with different stakeholders were held at the Conference for e-Democracy and Open Government (CeDEM) held in Austria and in South Korea in 2016. In the second phase, an online survey was sent to all the users of the e-journal JeDEM in October 2019. From the workshops, key differences regarding OA perception and strategies between the stakeholder groups were derived. Participants strongly perceived OA publishing as a highly individualist matter embedded within a publishing culture emphasizing reputation and rankings. The survey results, however, showed that institutional support differs considerably for authors. Factors such as visibility, reputation, and impact play the biggest role for the motivation to publish OA. The results from both inquiries provide a better understanding of OA publishing attitudes and the relevant digital literacies but also suggest the need to investigate further the enablers or difficulties of scholarship, particularly in a digital context. They clearly point to the potential of regularly addressing the users of the journal as well as communicating with them the more nuanced aspects of OA publishing, non-traditional metrics, or respective digital literacies, in order to reduce misconceptions about OA and to support critical stances.

AB  - In recent years, scholarly publishing faced a new paradigm regarding the accessibility: the open access movement."If an article is "Open Access" it means that it can be freely accessed by anyone in the world using an internet connection".1 The Budapest Open Access Initiative states: "By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself".2 Some researchers may have never been concerned about this topic.It obviously means that they are affiliated with a rich institution from a rich country.There are few things more discouraging for a researcher than performing a literature search, retrieving a list of potentially interesting articles, and not being able to access many of them because one's library does not subscribe those journals.And this lack of access will increase, even in major Universities from rich countries 3 , where the average cost of subscription reached 12,000 USD per faculty member more than 10 years ago.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to conduct a comprehensive, objective and critical analysis of the results of research on open access in Ukraine to assess the current state of the topic and identify the aspects which require deeper study in order to develop an effective mechanism for implementing the principles of open access in practice. Research methods. The method of narrative literature review with a defined search strategy and criteria for selecting publications in four databases, such as Dimensions, Scopus, Web of Science and the depository of electronic copies “Scientific Periodicals of Ukraine” was used. The inclusion criteria were articles published by authors affiliated with Ukrainian institutions. The scientific novelty lies in the fact that the literature analysis helped to expand and deepen knowledge about the thematic areas of open access research in Ukraine; to identify previously unknown links and contradictions between studies; and to identify areas that require further studies, which include, in particular, the analysis of factors and barriers that facilitate or prevent Ukrainian authors from disseminating their works in open access, the dynamics of growth and peculiarities of the distribution of the share of open access publications by year and field of study. Conclusions. Open access is one of the main components of Open Science. It serves as a tool for accelerating knowledge sharing, developing science, helping to eliminate inequality, and helping to solve several global problems. The research of Ukrainian scientists focuses on four primary areas of open access research: the development of open access policies at the level of institutions and the state, the introduction of institutional repositories, the launch of open access journals, and the regulation of copyright in open scientific communication.

AB  - ABSTRACT This bibliometric study was performed to gain a better understanding of open access (OA) journal publishing at a large U.S. research university. While there is an increasing amount of aggregated data about OA publishing, there are few studies that examine local institutional OA publishing patterns. This study addresses that deficiency. Publications for Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) were located using Scopus and the Gold OA journals among those publications were identified. It was determined that approximately 9% of the articles published at TAMU were in Gold OA journals. Most of these journals were concentrated in Science (Q), Medicine (R), Agriculture (S), and Technology (T). The author rights of these journals were also examined and categorized. The majority of journals examined allowed authors to retain copyright, but more than 20% required the authors to transfer some or all of their copyright. To provide context and comparison, the percentage of Gold OA articles among 16 peer institutions, all public Association of Research Libraries (ARLs), was also determined using Web of Science. Gold OA publishing among the 16 peer institutions was between 4.99% and 9.45%. Scopus indicated a higher level of Gold OA publishing at TAMU compared to Web of Science.

Our presentation would outline the RSC’s view on Open Access, and how as a society publisher we are supporting the funder-led evolution to Gold open access with a Gold for Gold initiative, ensuring academics can further increase the visibility of their quality research, and fulfil their funder mandate. The presentation will show how this initiative has been successfully piloted in the UK, which has been one of the first countries to mandate Open Access, and is now available to all our authors worldwide. The presentation will also cover some of the activities that the RSC is undertaking to support researchers with the dissemination of their research and to ensure the impact of this is maximised.

AB  - Canadian university libraries, Canadian university presses, and non-university scholarly presses at Canadian universities were surveyed in the first part of 2010 as to the level of their support of Open Access (OA) journal publishing. Respondents were asked about journal hosting services in their organization as well as their thoughts on internal and external support for open access publishing. Results showed that most of the organizations are hosting OA journals, largely between one and five in number, and many supply journal hosting services, including some technical support. Personnel resources are a notable factor in the ability to host journals. Most respondents engage in some sort of internal support for open access publishing and are open to options that they are presently not utilizing. They are particularly amenable to OA publishing support from outside of their organizations, especially assistance at a consortial level.

AB  - Open Access (OA) describes the free, unrestricted access to and re-use of research articles. Recently, a new wave of interest, debate, and practice surrounding OA publishing has emerged. In this paper, we provide a simple overview of the trends in OA practice in the broad field of geochemistry. Characteristics of the approach such as whether or not an article processing charge (APC) exists, what embargo periods or restrictions on self-archiving’ policies are in place, and whether or not the sharing of preprints is permitted are described. The majority of journals have self-archiving policies that allow authors to share their peer reviewed work via green OA without charge. There is no clear relationship between journal impact and APC. The journals with the highest APC are typically those of the major commercial publishers, rather than the geochemistry community themselves. The rise in OA publishing has potential impacts on the profiles of researchers and tends to devolve costs from organizations to individuals. Until the geochemistry community makes the decision to move away from journal-based evaluation criteria, it is likely that such high costs will continue to impose financial inequities upon research community. However, geochemists could more widely choose legal self-archiving as an equitable and sustainable way to disseminate their research.

AB  - Campus-based open access author funds are being considered by many academic libraries as a way to support authors publishing in open access journals. Article processing fees for open access have been introduced recently by publishers and have not yet been widely accepted by authors. Few studies have surveyed authors on their reasons for publishing open access and their perceptions of open access journals. The present study was designed to gauge the uptake of library support for author funding and author satisfaction with open access publishing. Results indicate that York University authors are increasingly publishing in open access journals and are appreciative of library funding initiatives. The wider implications of open access are discussed along with specific recommendations for publishers.

AB  - Based on a paper presented at the UKSG seminar 'Scientific Publications: Free for all?', The Geological Society, London, Tuesday 23 November 2004 This article offers a perspective about open access and the current 'churn' in scholarly journal publication from a collections development and scholarly communications specialist librarian in the United States. The differences between the US and UK higher education systems are not insignificant, the former being more extensive as well as more diverse in sources of funding support, with less direct involvement by national government. Thus, while librarians in both countries very much aim to improve various aspects of scholarly communications, their approaches and expectations may be somewhat different. The author suggests that much more experimentation with business models is needed before we can well understand the sustainability of open access, the models that can effectively support it, and to what extent. Early evidence suggests that there are no panaceas that will result in close to free journal publication; under an open access publishing system, the costs to research-intensive universities may well increase.

AB  - In recent years open access models have transcended traditional modes of publishing, thus enabling freer access to research. This paper takes a trans-regional approach to open access publishing in the Asia and Oceania region focussing on individual institutions in three countries – Charles Darwin University (Australia), University of Hong Kong and the University of Malaya, reflecting on how each one is rising, in its own individual way, to meet the range of challenges that its research communities are facing. Specifically, it focuses on open access and institutional repository development, and traces their development at each of the aforementioned institutions. This paper is based on interviews conducted with staff involved with the development of the repository, and the open access collection in particular, at each of the three institutions. It synthesises open access developments and reviews the role the library has played in each institution in the development of open access across the academic and research community; and the success that has been achieved to date. It highlights any common factors between the approaches taken by each institution, as well as any significant differences of note. The findings reveal that each of the three institutions is at a different stage of development with the University of Hong Kong repository ranked at the top within Asia. Each has used a slightly different approach toward open access, and used different software to develop their repository. The authors have collated the overall experiences of each institution in open access publishing and repository development. They have highlighted the successes and failures that each has experienced and formulated a set of guidelines that may help those embarking on establishing an open access repository.

AB  - In this opinion article, the author describes his experiences of naming, listing, and analyzing predatory journals. The gold open-access model has led to the creation of many predatory journals that exist only to exploit researchers. Medical research is the most valuable research for humans, so we must guard against the publishing of medical research in predatory journals. Community-based journals that combine a geographical and a disciplinary focus may be seen as a defense against the pathological nature of predatory publishers.

AB  - Abstract The goal of open access is to allow more people to read and use research outputs. An observed association between highly cited research outputs and open access has been claimed as evidence of increased usage of the research, but this remains controversial. A higher citation count also does not necessarily imply wider usage such as citations by authors from more places. A knowledge gap exists in our understanding of who gets to use open access research outputs and where users are located. Here we address this gap by examining the association between an output’s open access status and the diversity of research outputs that cite it. By analysing large-scale bibliographic data from 2010 to 2019, we found a robust association between open access and increased diversity of citation sources by institutions, countries, subregions, regions, and fields of research, across outputs with both high and medium–low citation counts. Open access through disciplinary or institutional repositories showed a stronger effect than open access via publisher platforms. This study adds a new perspective to our understanding of how citations can be used to explore the effects of open access. It also provides new evidence at global scale of the benefits of open access as a mechanism for widening the use of research and increasing the diversity of the communities that benefit from it.

AB  - The research literature on open access (OA) publishing has mainly dealt with journals publishing in English, and studies focusing on OA journals in other languages are less common. This article addresses this gap via a case study focusing on Chinese-language OA journals. It starts with the identification of the major characteristics of this market, followed by eight semi-structured interviews to explore the key motivations behind Chinese-language OA publishing and perceived barriers. The majority of Chinese OA journals are published in Chinese, and most of them are published by universities and scholarly societies. Nearly 80% of journals were launched before the digital age and were converted to OA later. The subject distribution is highly skewed towards the science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) fields. Publishers are motivated to convert journals to OA by an expected increase in academic impact, which would also attract more submissions. The lack of a sufficient number of high-quality submissions is perceived as the largest barrier to the successful publishing of journals. The financial instability of journals is identified as the main obstacle hindering internationalisation. The central conclusions of the study are that Chinese-language OA journals need to increase their visibility in journal indexes such as the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and that an OA publishing platform (similar to the Latin American SciELO) should be established for Chinese-language OA journals.

AB  - &lt;p&gt;This article presents the rationale, common practices, challenges, and some personal anecdotes from a journal editor on the production, use, and re-use of peer-reviewed, scholarly articles as open educational resources (OER). The scholarly and professional discourse related to open educational resources has largely focused on open learning objects, courseware, and textbooks. However, especially in graduate education, articles published in scholarly journals are often a major component of the course content in formal education. In addition, open access journal articles are critical to expanding access to knowledge by scholars in the developing world and in fostering citizen science, by which everyone has access to the latest academic information and research results. In this article, I highlight some of the challenges, economic models, and evidence for quality of open access journal content and look at new affordances provided by the Net for enhanced functionality, access, and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the seventeen years since I graduated with a doctorate degree, the climate and acceptance of open access publishing has almost reversed itself. I recall a conversation with my PhD supervisor in which he argued that publishing online was not a viable option as the product would not have permanency, scholarly recognition, or the prestige of a paper publication. His comments reflect the confusion between online resources and those described as open access, but as well illustrate the change in academic acceptance and use of open access products during the past decade. The evolution from paper to online production and consumption is a disruptive technology in which much lower cost and increased accessibility of online work opens the product to a completely new group of potential users. In the case of OER these consumers are primarily students, but certainly access to scholars from all parts of the globe and the availability to support citizen science (Silvertown, 2009) should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - he world of scientific research and scholarly publishing is undergoing a profound transformation in large part due to the rapid development of information and communication technologies.The Internet and the advent of faster networking capabilities now allow virtually unlimited access to information, remote data gathering, real-time integration of data into databases and models, and online purchasing of research supplies.At the same time, it has opened new possibilities for researchers to communicate with colleagues and with the society in general.However, although some investigators in the developing world are keeping pace with this new reality, the majority are largely excluded from this transformation because of their limited access to scientific information.Particularly relevant to the area of pathogen research, the vast majority of infectious diseases in humans, animals, and plants occurs in the developing world, and efficient communication between local scientists in developing countries and the global community will facilitate advances in knowledge and control of these pathogens.Here we discuss open access and socially responsible philosophies in relation to scientific training, publishing, and intellectual property, and give examples of how we can help keep the developing world fully informed about these new models.The first step is training partners in developing countries in laboratory techniques and epidemiological skills that complement their existing programs, as well as developing their proficiency in grant proposal writing.A number of organizations have undertaken workshops on such topics around the world, including the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/en/), the Pan American Health Organization (http://www.paho.org), the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health (http:// www.fic.nih.gov), and the Sustainable Sciences Institute ([SSI]; http://www.ssilink.org),which we represent.SSI is a San Francisco-based organization that helps scientists in underprivileged environments gain access to the resources, technologies, skills, and knowledge they need to conduct cutting-edge research with an impact on public health and to effectively communicate their results [1].Importantly, these organizations make the content of their courses freely available to participants in the workshops and others, similar to an open-access policy.Performing research is not the only issue at stake; the scientific community evaluates career advancement and stature primarily by the number and quality of published research articles in peer-reviewed journals, and few investigators in developing countries receive training on how to convert their work into publishable manuscripts.

AB  - In this paper, we respond to five rebuttals to Kingsley and Kennan (2015). Four researchers in the information systems field and a university library director of research infrastructure provided these rebuttals. Almost without exception, the rebuttals from the information systems researchers take an analytical approach to the question of scholarly communication in their field. However, in undertaking their individual analyses of scholarly publishing or communication, they do not directly address the issues raised in our original debate piece. The rebuttal from the university library administrator (Groenewegen, 2015) alone directly addresses the discussion points raised in the original debate. As researchers in the field of scholarly communications, while this was not how we originally envisioned the debate, the rebuttals as a body of work have opened up some interesting themes, which we explore in addition to responding to the individual rebuttals.

AB  - With this paper, we hope to foster debate about the place of open access (OA) in scholarly publishing. After providing a background to OA’s development and current state, we examine some of the accusations leveled against it: that OA publishers are predatory, that OA is too expensive, and that self-depositing papers in OA repositories will bring about the end of scholarly publishing. After contextualizing each accusation, we show that they arise from problems with not only access, open or otherwise, but also the scholarly publishing system more broadly. Accordingly, we instead propose the discussions we believe the scholarly community should be having about scholarly publishing to take advantage of social and technological innovations and move it into the 21st century.

AB  - The paper argues that criminal justice scholarship disseminated through the traditional journal subscription model is not consistent with social justice. Adoption of "open access" principles in publishing benefits both authors and readers through broader and more egalitarian dissemination of criminal justice literature. Moreover, when viewed in light of social justice theory, open access is a more just method of scholarly communication. After providing a brief outline of the history and basic aspects of open access, the paper uses the framework of the social justice theories of John Rawls and David Miller to argue why open access is more just than traditional subscription models of publishing and why criminal justice scholars and their associations must consider the importance of supporting open access initiatives and promoting the dissemination of scholarship as widely as possible if they are concerned about attaining justice for criminal justice scholarly literature.

AB  - Abstract Editor's Summary Since the 1990s, the aim of open access (OA) has been to enhance scholarly communication by delivering scientific publications on the Internet without fees or restrictions. Adoption of the gold model of OA, electronic access to publishers' scientific journals at no cost, has been slow in the United States and the United Kingdom, even if authors pay an extra OA charge. The more successful route has been green OA, publishing the original or modified versions on authors' personal home pages or in institutional or subject‐specific repositories. In a 2008 sample of science disciplines, Bjork found 20.4% were provided OA, with 8.5% on publishers' sites. For information systems articles published in 2009, 21.3% were OA but a mere 0.6% on publishers' sites, the gold model. Of OA articles, 8% were published on domain repositories, 32.7% in institutional repositories, and 59% on other websites. Broad expansion of OA will depend on greater author awareness and wider platform access, and publishers must adopt international bibliographic metadata and standardized author identification.

AB  - Abstract Objective To study the impact of converting from subscription‐based publishing to open access (“flipping”) in three obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) journals. Methods We compared original articles in three OBGYN journals during a matched subscription‐based and open access publishing period. We analyzed citation metrics and country of authorship. Results Overall, 1522 studies were included; of those, 869 (57.1%) were before flipping and 653 (42.9%) were after flipping. There was a decrease in publications by lower‐middle income countries from 7.7% in subscription‐based publishing to 1.8% in open access ( P &lt; 0.001). There was a decrease in the proportion of articles from South Asia (2.5% vs 0.5%), North America (14.4% vs 9.4%), and the Middle East (7.4% vs 2.5%), and an increase in publications from East Asia and Pacific (17.4% vs 30.9%; P &lt; 0.001). The relative citation ratio was higher in the open access period (median 1.65 vs 0.95, P &lt; 0.001). The number of citations per year was higher in the open access period (median 3.0 vs 2.0, P &lt; 0.001). There was an increase in the proportion of funded studies (from 40.2% to 47.8%; P = 0.003). Conclusions Flipping to open access in OBGYN journals is associated with a citation advantage with major authorship changes, leading to inequity.

AB  - In the past few years there has been an ongoing debate as to whether the proliferation of open access (OA) publishing would damage the peer review system and put the quality of scientific journal publishing at risk. Our aim was to inform this debate by comparing the scientific impact of OA journals with subscription journals, controlling for journal age, the country of the publisher, discipline and (for OA publishers) their business model. The 2-year impact factors (the average number of citations to the articles in a journal) were used as a proxy for scientific impact. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) was used to identify OA journals as well as their business model. Journal age and discipline were obtained from the Ulrich's periodicals directory. Comparisons were performed on the journal level as well as on the article level where the results were weighted by the number of articles published in a journal. A total of 610 OA journals were compared with 7,609 subscription journals using Web of Science citation data while an overlapping set of 1,327 OA journals were compared with 11,124 subscription journals using Scopus data. Overall, average citation rates, both unweighted and weighted for the number of articles per journal, were about 30% higher for subscription journals. However, after controlling for discipline (medicine and health versus other), age of the journal (three time periods) and the location of the publisher (four largest publishing countries versus other countries) the differences largely disappeared in most subcategories except for journals that had been launched prior to 1996. OA journals that fund publishing with article processing charges (APCs) are on average cited more than other OA journals. In medicine and health, OA journals founded in the last 10 years are receiving about as many citations as subscription journals launched during the same period. Our results indicate that OA journals indexed in Web of Science and/or Scopus are approaching the same scientific impact and quality as subscription journals, particularly in biomedicine and for journals funded by article processing charges.

AB  - Little is known about open access publishing in educational technology journals that employ a hybrid model which charges authors only if they wish to publish via gold open access. In this study we sought to address this gap in the scholarly understanding of open access publishing in hybrid journals that publish research into the intersection of education and technology. We analysed three categories of article access types: gold, green, and limited access, and collected data on their prevalence in the seven-year period from 2010-2017 across 29 journals. Data was gathered from Scopus, Unpaywall, Sherpa RoMEO, and via manual searches of the journal websites, resulting in a dataset comprising the metadata of 8,479 articles. Our findings highlight that most research remains locked behind paywalls, that open access publishing through legal means is a minority activity for the scholars involved, and that the complexity and costs of legal open access publishing in these journals may be inhibiting the accessibility of research to readers.

AB  - Journal publishers play an important role in the open research data ecosystem. Through open data policies that include public data archiving mandates and data availability statements, journal publishers help promote transparency in research and wider access to a growing scholarly record. The library and information science (LIS) discipline has a unique relationship with both open data initiatives and academic publishing and may be well-positioned to adopt rigorous open data policies. This study examines the information provided on public-facing websites of LIS journals in order to describe the extent, and nature, of open data guidance provided to prospective authors. Open access journals in the discipline have disproportionately adopted detailed, strict open data policies. Commercial publishers, which account for the largest share of publishing in the discipline, have largely adopted weaker policies. Rigorous policies, adopted by a minority of journals, describe the rationale, application, and expectations for open research data, while most journals that provide guidance on the matter use hesitant and vague language. Recommendations are provided for strengthening journal open data policies.

AB  - Earlier this year, the British government approached Wikipedia’s founder, Jimmy Wales, to assist in making “taxpayer-funded academic research more widely available online.” The logic behind this decision was two-fold: like Wikipedia, open access (OA) publishing can translate into distributing research in a more timely fashion than traditional modes. Just as importantly, the Wikipedia approach attempts to disrupt the traditional model. That is, research is paid for, or subsidised by, public money but the public often does not have access to it unless they pay either a subscription or a “pay-per-view” fee. In essence, the public pays twice for the same goods. An OA approach could equate to getting what we, the public, paid for the first time.

AB  - Abstract Editormetrics analyses the role of editors of academic journals and their impact on the scientific publication system. Such analyses would best rely on open, structured, and machine-readable data about editors and editorial boards, which still remains rare. To address this shortcoming, the project Open Editors collects data about academic journal editors on a large scale and structures them into a single dataset. It does so by scraping the websites of 7,352 journals from 26 publishers (including predatory ones), thereby structuring publicly available information (names, affiliations, editorial roles, ORCID etc.) about 594,580 researchers. The dataset shows that journals and publishers are immensely heterogeneous in terms of editorial board sizes, regional diversity, and editorial role labels. All codes and data are made available at Zenodo, while the result is browsable at a dedicated website (https://openeditors.ooir.org). This dataset carries implications for both practical purposes of research evaluation and for meta-scientific investigations into the landscape of scholarly publications, and allows for critical inquiries regarding the representation of diversity and inclusivity across academia.

AB  - Open educational resources (OER), now in their 15th year of existence, consists of, in principle, fully open educational content, available for free to all and are adaptable to serve the needs of the user. They were created as a response to the high cost of textbooks and as a means of leveling the playing field in terms of ensuring equal access to education for disadvantaged populations. The selected resources below attest to the fact that a concerted effort is well underway to address and overcome these challenges. Institutions are increasingly investing in OER as research has demonstrated that they have a positive role to play in student learning. Libraries, already champions of copyright and open access initiatives, have the expertise to advocate for and collaborate on efforts to further the growth and impact of open educational resources both within their institutions and beyond.

AB  - The use and creation of Open Education Resources (OER) is becoming increasingly prevalent with teachers and learning designers at universities around the world. OER allows educators to create content and make their content available to the world under an open licence, and also provides the opportunity to use and adapt other OER content. Whilst the use and creation of OER in tertiary institutions is not yet considered the ‘norm’, many jurisdictions around the world have taken steps, to fund, support and encourage the use of OER in their educational institutions. The Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has developed an Open Education (OE) initiative to support the use and creation of OER at QUT. Policy is often the foundation stone, which supports progress and change. The underlying policy provides the framework and often points to the legal parameters that guide the objectives of the project or movement. The importance of policy is evident in the way in which QUT has developed and implemented an OE initiative to promote and support the creation and use of OER. This paper considers the history and development of OER, using QUT’s OE initiative as an example of the ways in which policy and implementation can lead to positive change.

AB  - Scientific progress is built on research that is reliable, accurate, and verifiable. The methods and evidentiary reasoning that underlie scientific claims must be available for scrutiny. Like other fields, the education sciences suffer from problems such as failure to replicate, validity and generalization issues, publication bias, and high costs of access to publications—all of which are symptoms of a nontransparent approach to research. Each aspect of the scientific cycle—research design, data collection, analysis, and publication—can and should be made more transparent and accessible. Open Education Science is a set of practices designed to increase the transparency of evidentiary reasoning and access to scientific research in a domain characterized by diverse disciplinary traditions and a commitment to impact in policy and practice. Transparency and accessibility are functional imperatives that come with many benefits for the individual researcher, scientific community, and society at large—Open Education Science is the way forward.

AB  - Background. The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is helping the European to prepare for an integrative system for intelligent management of biodiversity knowledge. The infrastructure that is envisaged and that will be further developed within the Programme "Horizon 2020" aims to provide open and free access to taxonomic information to anyone with a requirement for biodiversity data, without the need for individual consent of other persons or institutions. Open and free access to information will foster the re-use and improve the quality of data, will accelerate research, and will promote new types of research. Progress towards the goal of free and open access to content is hampered by numerous technical, economic, sociological, legal, and other factors. The present article addresses barriers to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge that arise from European laws, in particular European legislation on copyright and database protection rights.We present a legal point of view as to what will be needed to bring distributed information together and facilitate its re-use by data mining, integration into semantic knowledge systems, and similar techniques. We address exceptions and limitations of copyright or database protection within Europe, and we point to the importance of data use agreements. We illustrate how exceptions and limitations have been transformed into national legislations within some European states to create inconsistencies that impede access to biodiversity information.Conclusions. The legal situation within the EU is unsatisfactory because there are inconsistencies among states that hamper the deployment of an open biodiversity knowledge management system. Scientists within the EU who work with copyright protected works or with protected databases have to be aware of regulations that vary from country to country. This is a major stumbling block to international collaboration and is an impediment to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge. Such differences should be removed by unifying exceptions and limitations for research purposes in a binding, Europe-wide regulation.

AB  - An increasing number of scientific publications are created in open and transparent peer review models: a submission is published first, and then reviewers are invited, or a submission is reviewed in a closed environment but then these reviews are published with the final article, or combinations of these. Reasons for open peer review include giving better credit to reviewers, and enabling readers to better appraise the quality of a publication. In most cases, the full, unstructured text of an open review is published next to the full, unstructured text of the article reviewed. This approach prevents human readers from getting a quick impression of the quality of parts of an article, and it does not easily support secondary exploitation, e.g., for scientometrics on reviews. While document formats have been proposed for publishing structured articles including reviews, integrated tool support for entire open peer review workflows resulting in such documents is still scarce. We present AR-Annotator, the Automatic Article and Review Annotator which employs a semantic information model of an article and its reviews, using semantic markup and unique identifiers for all entities of interest. The fine-grained article structure is not only exposed to authors and reviewers but also preserved in the published version. We publish articles and their reviews in a Linked Data representation and thus maximise their reusability by third party applications. We demonstrate this reusability by running quality-related queries against the structured representation of articles and their reviews.

AB  - <p class="p1">‘Public access to publicly funded research’ has been one of the rallying calls of the global open access movement. Governments and public institutions around the world have mandated that publications supported by public funding sources should be publicly accessible. Publishers are experimenting with new models to widen access. Yet financial flows underpinning scholarly publishing remain complex and opaque. In this article we present work to trace and reassemble a picture of financial flows around the publication of journals in the UK in the midst of a national shift towards open access. We contend that the current lack of financial transparency around scholarly communication is an obstacle to evidence-based policy-making – leaving researchers, decision-makers and institutions in the dark about the ­systemic implications of new financial models. We conclude that ­obtaining a more joined up picture of financial flows is vital as a means for researchers, ­institutions and others to understand and shape changes to the ­sociotechnical systems that underpin scholarly communication.

AB  - This article presents a case study for transitioning library-led open-educational resources (OER) initiatives away from labor-intensive activities to a model where library personnel focus on project management responsibilities. This shift from labour-intensive activities, such as workshops and training sessions, led to more collaborative partnerships with faculty and students to produce OER projects. In particular, we focus on labour implications for the various stakeholders involved and the sustainability of these initiatives. We describe several initiatives undertaken by the Ohio University Libraries to encourage open educational resource adoptions and projects, including a grant-funded initiative to provide support services for faculty creating OER. That funding, which was awarded to enhance undergraduate education, has been used to support the development of five OER projects that have directly involved students in the creation of those materials. We provide an overview of the various ways in which students have become involved in OER creation in partnership with faculty and librarians and discuss the impact these partnerships have had on student-faculty-librarian relationships and student engagement. Among these projects are an Hispanic linguistics open textbook created using only student-authored texts, student-generated test banks to accompany existing OER materials for a large-enrollment art history course, and several other projects in which hired student assistants are helping faculty to develop content for open textbooks. This article helps to address a gap in the literature by providing transparency regarding the personnel, costs, and workflow for Ohio University Libraries’ OER initiatives and addressing potential areas of concern surrounding student labour.

AB  - The article unpacks the publishing practices and focuses on the curating work carried out by the editors of chemistry journals. Based on a qualitative analysis of multiple sources in two publishing houses (the American Chemical Society, ACS and Nature Research), it first shows that the role of editor-in-chief covers a wide range of realities and is far from being limited to that of a gatekeeper (the most common metaphor in the literature). In journals that are part of the Nature Research portfolio, in-house editors, who are no longer active scientists, work full time for the journals. The article describes the professional trajectories and skills required to join the publishing house. Interviews highlight collective identity-based actions, attention to the growth and the flow of manuscripts, but also specific epistemic properties of outputs in chemistry. Besides tasks that editors outline “as really the same as they were 100 years ago,” as they spend most of their time handling manuscripts and providing quality assurance, they also travel to conferences to support journals and encourage submissions, visit labs where researchers pitch their work or ask questions about journals, and “educate the actors themselves” about new fields. In both cases studied, the publishing houses partner with institutions to offer events (ACS on Campus programme, Nature masterclass) that a university or department can freely host or buy, where editors organize workshops on all aspects of manuscript preparation. Second, publishing houses, whether non-for-profit or commercial, have embraced a catalog logic, where the journals are not necessarily in competition and have an assumed place and hierarchy. At Nature Research, editors-in-chief head business units inscribed in the company's organization. Despite standardized processes imposed by the procedural chain, there is still room to maneuver in these relatively autonomous structures that are ultimately evaluated on their results (the annual production of a certain number of high-quality papers). On the other hand, ACS is seen as a vessel whose course cannot easily be deviated. The conclusion calls for extending this type of investigation to other contexts or types of journals.

AB  - Abstract Abstract The rise of the World Wide Web represents one of the most significant transitions in communications since the printing press or even since the origins of writing. To Open Access and Open Data advocates, the web offers great opportunity for expanding the accessibility, scale, diversity and quality of archaeological communications. Nevertheless, Open Access and Open Data face steep adoption barriers. Critics wrongly see Open Access as a threat to peer review. Others see data transparency as naively technocratic and lacking in an appreciation of archaeology's social and professional incentive structure. However, as argued in this paper, the Open Access and Open Data movements do not gloss over sustainability, quality and professional incentive concerns. Rather, these reform movements offer much needed and trenchant critiques of the academy's many dysfunctions. These dysfunctions, ranging from the expectations of tenure and review committees to the structure of the academic publishing industry, go largely unknown and unremarked by most archaeologists. At a time of cutting fiscal austerity, Open Access and Open Data offer desperately needed ways to expand research opportunities, reduce costs and expand the equity and effectiveness of archaeological communication. Keywords: Open AccessOpen Datascholarly communicationsdata sharingdata preservationinformation architecturesethicscareer paths Acknowledgements My experiences working on various Open Access and Open Data initiatives informed this discussion. These efforts focus on Open Context (http://opencontext.org), a data publication venue managed by the nonprofit Alexandria Archive Institute (http://alexandriaarchive.org) and archived by the University of California, California Digital Library (CDL). Over the years, Open Context has benefited from funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, Institute for Museum and Library Services, the Joukowsky Family Foundation and, most recently, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. I gratefully acknowledge current financial support for Open Context data publication projects from the American Council for Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities (Award: HK-50037-12) and the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org). While I want to thank my colleagues at CDL for their support and insights in digital libraries, data preservation and scholarly communications, the views and perspectives presented in this paper are my own. In addition, I want to thank my colleagues at Digital Antiquity for their tireless advocacy for greater data professionalism, my colleagues at IPinCH (http://www.sfu.ca/ipinch) for their vitally needed efforts to improve archaeology's information ethics, my colleagues on the Google Ancient Places project, Pelagios, Pleiades, Portable Antiquities Scheme and Nomisma. These efforts provide invaluable leadership toward building linked, open, distributed and collaborative data sharing. Finally, I want to thank my wife, partner and esteemed colleague Sarah Whitcher Kansa for her insightful comments and edits on drafts of this paper and for her partnership in all of these efforts.

(2011 Schiff, L. 2012. Data publishing–the first 500 years. Data Pub, Available at: http://datapub.cdlib.org/?p=67 (accessed 5 April 2012) [Google Scholar]) note that, even if libraries keep their own local copies of content, licensing restrictions, metadata ownership questions and lack of supporting software make preservation and access of such content difficult and expensive. Bartman authored a follow-up editorial as a ‘clarification’ of the AIA's position; see http://www.archaeological.org/news/aianews/10349. This later editorial has a less confrontational tone, though it still communicates a belief that open access is not financially feasible for AIA publications. Like all forms of scholarly communication, Open Access is not immune to abuse. Some archaeologists receive email ‘spam’ soliciting articles for Open Access publication paid for by hefty processing fees. Other, ‘closed access’ presses make similar solicitations as do organizers of some high-commercialized conferences. As in all publication decisions, archaeologists should be judicious in selecting an Open Access venue. http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/ http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/reports/2012/value-and-benefits-of-text-mining.aspx A search for ‘ethics copyright archaeology’ in Google Scholar quickly returns snippets of articles about archaeological ethics, but those snippets are publisher copyright assertions.

In that sense, the SAA is less heavily tied to the current toll-access status quo. The weblog ‘Doug's Archaeology’ has aggregated financial data for US nonprofit scholarly societies, detailing publication finances; see links http://dougsarchaeology.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/society-for-american-archaeology-990-form/, and http://dougsarchaeology.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/would-you-pay-4-84-per-page-to-read-a-journal/. Experiments with Open Access monographs have yielded mixed results in terms of financial sustainability, despite demonstrated positive impacts in terms of wider dissemination and longer-lasting scholarly attention; see Hadro (2010 Hadro, J. 2010. At SPARC-ACRL Forum: reality check on open access monographs. Library Journal, 21 January Available at: http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6715759.html [Google Scholar]). University presses in general face sustainability challenges with monograph publication, even without adopting Open Access models. Elizabeth Bartman's clarification of her editorial attacking Open Access (http://www.archaeological.org/news/aianews/10349) makes a similar point in that publication expenses rarely see direct support from granting agencies. However, most academic archaeologists do see less direct public support, either though employment at public universities or employment at nonprofit institutions that benefit from public subsidies and tax exemptions.

AB  - Metrics on open access (OA) availability of content published in scholarly journals (i.e. content licences, copyright ownership, and publisher-stipulated self-archiving permissions) are still scarce. This study implements the four core variables of the recently published Open Access Spectrum (OAS) (reader rights, reuse rights, copyright, and author posting rights) to measure the level of openness in all 1,728 Spanish scholarly journals listed in the Spanish national DULCINEA database at the end of 2015. Data exported from the database and used as variables for the analysis were: journal research area, type of publisher, type of access, self-archiving and reuse policy, and type of Creative Commons (CC) licence used. Out of the total number of journals (1,728), 1,285 (74.5%) published their articles OA immediately after initial publication and thus received the maximum OAS score for reader rights; 37.5% of all journals used CC licences, and 79.5% allowed self-archiving in some form. In 72% of journals, authors retained or publishers granted broad rights, which included author reuse and authorization rights (for others to reuse), whilst 13.5% did not specify any terms for copyright transfer. Similar studies could be carried out on other countries as this would enable comparisons of the general adoption and form of openness in different parts of the world.

AB  - Abstract Open peer review (OPR), where review reports and reviewers’ identities are published alongside the articles, represents one of the last aspects of the open science movement to be widely embraced, although its adoption has been growing since the turn of the century. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of OPR adoption, its early adopters and the implementation approaches used. Current bibliographic databases do not systematically index OPR journals, nor do the OPR journals clearly state their policies on open identities and open reports. Using various methods, we identified 617 OPR journals that published at least one article with open identities or open reports as of 2019 and analyzed their wide-ranging implementations to derive emerging OPR practices. The findings suggest that: (1) there has been a steady growth in OPR adoption since 2001, when 38 journals initially adopted OPR, with more rapid growth since 2017; (2) OPR adoption is most prevalent in medical and scientific disciplines (79.9%); (3) five publishers are responsible for 81% of the identified OPR journals; (4) early adopter publishers have implemented OPR in different ways, resulting in different levels of transparency. Across the variations in OPR implementations, two important factors define the degree of transparency: open identities and open reports. Open identities may include reviewer names and affiliation as well as credentials; open reports may include timestamped review histories consisting of referee reports and author rebuttals or a letter from the editor integrating reviewers’ comments. When and where open reports can be accessed are also important factors indicating the OPR transparency level. Publishers of optional OPR journals should add metric data in their annual status reports.

AB  - Open peer review (OPR) is a type of review that has long since made space alongside the more well-known single-blind and double-blind peer reviews. Despite this, we still do not have a shared definition by the scientific community and publishers. The purpose of this paper is to offer some reflections on the selection of reviewers in OPR, a process that in its current configuration is traced back to the 19th century. After a brief overview of the best-known definitions of open peer review, the paper continues with an analysis of some aspects of reviewer selection carried out with the help of data from a recent survey.

AB  - Recently significant initiatives have been launched for the dissemination of Open Access as part of the Open Science movement. Nevertheless, two other major pillars of Open Science such as Open Research Data (ORD) and Open Peer Review (OPR) are still in an early stage of development among the communities of researchers and stakeholders. The present study sought to unveil the perceptions of a medical and health sciences community about these issues. Through the investigation of researchers‘ attitudes, valuable conclusions can be drawn, especially in the field of medicine and health sciences, where an explosive growth of scientific publishing exists. A quantitative survey was conducted based on a structured questionnaire, with 179 valid responses. The participants in the survey agreed with the Open Peer Review principles. However, they ignored basic terms like FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and appeared incentivized to permit the exploitation of their data. Regarding Open Peer Review (OPR), participants expressed their agreement, implying their support for a trustworthy evaluation system. Conclusively, researchers need to receive proper training for both Open Research Data principles and Open Peer Review processes which combined with a reformed evaluation system will enable them to take full advantage of the opportunities that arise from the new scholarly publishing and communication landscape.

AB  - In this editorial, we describe the work that has been undertaken by the ESTS editorial collective (EC) over the last two years towards establishing a publishing infrastructure for open research data. A broad movement in the scholarly community is pushing towards data sharing or “open data,” particularly in the natural sciences and medicine. Recognizing that there are compelling reasons why scholars are wary of data sharing and careful to protect their work, our EC has pursued experiments towards establishing a publishing infrastructure. The goal is to better understand the possible benefits for the STS community from data sharing and the role that a scholarly-run journal like ESTS could play in realizing such opportunities. The sharing of data could serve as an archive of work in/for STS; offer greater recognition of diverse contributions to scholarly research beyond individual author(s); enable reuse of data for new insights and pedagogical opportunities; and engender new forms of scholarly community in the field.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore the status of research data sharing among researchers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and internationally. Relevant data was extracted from the Data Citation Index (DCI) using an advanced search strategy, which was limited to the publication years between 2009 and 2014. Data was analysed to obtain the number of data records by country, institution, subject category, year of publication, and document type as well as the number of citations. A Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to gauge the relationship between the data records and research articles. Findings indicate that only 20 (out of 50) countries in sub-Saharan Africa produced at least one data record in the DCI, with South Africa leading the pack with 539 (61.39 %) records followed by Kenya, Cameroon and Ghana. SSA contributes a mere 0.03 % of the world's research data as compared to 1.4 % of the world's research articles. Research institutions and universities are the major contributors of research data, which largely focuses on Genetics and Heredity (61.3 %), Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (61.3 %), Agriculture (29.2 %) and Forestry (27.3 %). Citation-wise, the research data has attracted fewer average citations than the articles. A correlational analysis of the data reveals that there is a significant correlation between the publication of data and research articles.

AB  - Today, one can observe shifts in the research landscape, which is formed by digitization and open science principles. The open science movement continues to gain momentum, attention and debate. In parallel with the principle of unity, open science gives rise to a taxonomy of several related ideas, guidelines and concepts, such as open access, open replicable research and open data. Over the past fifteen years, research institutions have focused on open access to publications. However, recently the focus of attention has shifted to research data as a “new currency” in research activities and their distribution in open access, and the guiding principles of data management are becoming crucial for the wide implementation of open science practices and the effective use of data in research, industry, business and other sectors of the economy. In this context, it is relevant to carry out a thorough study of primary scientific works on open science issues and to study the role of the concept of “open research data” in the paradigm of a holistic ecosystem of open science and business ecosystem. In this work, it is proposed to use the methods of quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis, which allows to identify the main trends and form the basis for further research. The information base for this work was the international scientometric database Scopus, which enables to analyze bibliographic data using built-in tools and import them for external use in the VOSviewer software. The study revealed an increasing trend in the number of publications on the subject under study, with the highest annual growth rate in 2017 (76%) and 2019 (66%). Qualitative bibliographic analysis made it possible to analyze the most cited and, therefore, trending works on the selected topic. In terms of the number of citations per year, the results show that the studies with such directions in open science as open program code (open source); data/research reproducibility, research data management; open access to publications (open access) are most popular. In addition, a cluster analysis of the co-prevalence of keywords was conducted. It formed clusters dedicated to both institutional and infrastructural problems of the development of open science and research data. Separately, the results of the analysis create a scientific basis for further research into the key determinants of the effectiveness of the implementation of a proper research data management system at the micro, meso, and macro levels. It will improve the effectiveness of the implementation of scientific developments from one field of knowledge to another, while achieving increased interdisciplinary research. In parallel with this, interested persons of the real sector of the economy get the opportunity to analyze scientific results, determining the possibility of their adoption in their own activities.

AB  - Trends within universities and scholarly publishers are converging to develop tools and services to maximize the societal impacts of research. The open research agenda underpins drives to improve accessibility to knowledge, while the academic community is increasingly tasked to generate “impact” on society. With obvious synergies between these agendas, it is increasingly important for collaboration across the research ecosystem to build on this complementarity. This article reflects on, and conjects a future for, academic-publisher collaborations to connect these agendas. Les tendances au sein des universités et des éditeurs savants convergent pour développer des outils et des services permettant de maximiser les impacts sociétaux de la recherche. L’agenda de la recherche de libre accès sous-tend les efforts visant à améliorer l’accessibilité aux connaissances, tandis que la communauté universitaire est de plus en plus chargée de générer un « impact » sur la société. Compte tenu des synergies évidentes entre ces agendas, il est de plus en plus important que la collaboration au sein de l’écosystème de la recherche s’appuie sur cette complémentarité. Cet article est le fruit d’une réflexion et d’une conjecture sur l’avenir des collaborations entre les universités et les éditeurs afin de relier ces agendas. Il est rédigé conjointement par un gestionnaire de l’impact de la recherche et un chercheur universitaire (Bayley), un praticien de la mobilisation des connaissances universitaire (Phipps) et des collègues d’Emerald Publishing (Roche et Lodge).

AB  - South African higher education institutions are the largest producers of research output on the African continent. Given this status, South African researchers have a moral obligation to share their research output with the rest of the continent via a medium that minimizes challenges of access; open scholarship is that medium. The majority of South African higher education libraries provide an open access publishing service. However, in most of these cases this service is via engagement with the green open access route, that is, institutional repositories (IR). Some of the libraries have piloted and adopted gold open access services such as publishing of "diamond" gold open access journals and supporting article processing charges. The experiment with publishing open monographs is a new venture. This venture must be viewed against the backdrop of the need for open educational resources (OERs). OER is an area that is very much in a fledgling stage and is gaining traction, albeit, at a slow pace. The growth of IRs, the growth in support for gold open access including the library acting as a publisher, the experimentation with open monographs, and OERs are all shaping South Africa's scholarly publishing roadmap.

AB  - Jadranka Stojanovski discusses the evolution of library support for open science from a Croatian perspective. From her vantage point as (former) library director of the Ruđer Bošković Institute and associate professor at the department of information science of the University of Zadar, Stojanovski has been a pioneer in establishing services exploiting the possibilities offered by new information technologies since the 1990s. Many of her activities have been connected to broad European collaborative projects such as OpenAIRE, OASPA, and EOSC.&#x0D; The Croatian approach has been a very proactive one. Already in 1997, the CROSBI was launched, a combined national scientific bibliography and repository for Green Open Access documents. Although deposition of articles and other research documents is entirely voluntary, CROSBI now carries metadata on more than 725,000 documents, a large proportion of which are available in fulltext. Alongisde CROSBI, there are also several institutions running their own institutional repositories. There is now extensive collaboration between these services in the form of DABAR (‘beaver’ in English), aiming to enhance the interoperability and findability of documents stored in the various repositories. Stojanovski has also been involved in setting up an inventory on Who’s Who in Science in Croatia as well as a database on scientific equipment, Šestar (‘pair of compasses’).&#x0D; Set up in 2005, the HRČAK (‘hamster’) platform for Croatian scientific and professional journals has been a massive success. Less than twenty years after its inception, it now carries more than 500 scholarly journals and series of conference proceedings, nearly all of which are Diamond Open Access (i.e., free to the reader and with no author-facing publishing charges). Roughly 150 of these journals receive annual subsidies from the government, the rest are fully based on voluntary work from individual editors and the institutions or learned societies they represent. Only around 25 HRČAK journals charge Article Processing Charges. The Social Sciences and Humanities are particularly well represented on the platform, with many journals publishing in Croatian despite the lack of an official language policy in favor of Croatian as a scholarly language. The University Computing Centre in Zagreb (SRCE, ‘heart’) is responsible for the technical development of HRČAK, which is based on seamless interconnection between in-house developed software and open-source software for editorial processes, primarily Open Journal Systems.&#x0D; A national Research Data Policy or, better still, a general Open Science Policy is highly desirable, Stojanovski argues. Infrastructure is in place, but usage will undoubtedly rise significantly as soon as open science practices become mandatory.&#x0D; Alongside Dominic Tate (episode 43) and Pierre Mounier (episode 44), Jadranka was a keynote speaker at the 17th Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing. This interview was first published online on December 13, 2022.

AB  - Open science is considered a new science paradigm to make research accessible, accountable, and effective. Open science is already changing the academic profession starting from micro-practices to professional relations with epistemic communities and stakeholders, with implications that we are not yet able to predict. The article delves first into literature and official documentation to unfold the discursive regimes which sustain the spread of open science. A specific focus is then devoted to the professional transition, highlighting the role of funding organizations in setting the new science environment and the subjective experience of academics. The article is completed by a case study in the field of Research Data Management where the misalignment among incumbent/changing processes can be more apparent. Finally, a research agenda that focuses on how academic micro-practices are affecting organizations and science structures is proposed. This article aims at beginning to plow the ground for new research directions to emerge.

AB  - Contemporary evidence-informed policy-making (EIPM) and societies require openly accessible high-quality knowledge as input into transparent and accountable decision-making and informed societal action. Open Science1 supports this requirement. As both enablers and logical consequences of the paradigm of Open Science, the ideas of Open Access, Open Data, and FAIR publishing principles revolutionise how academic research needs to be conceptualised, conducted, disseminated, published, and used. This ‘academic openness quartet’ is especially relevant for the ways in which research data are created, annotated, curated, managed, shared, reproduced, (re-)used, and further developed in academia. Greater accessibility of scientific output and scholarly data also aims at increasing the transparency and reproducibility of research results and the quality of research itself. In the applied ‘academic openness quartet’ perspective, they also function as remedies for academic malaises, like missing replicability of results or secrecy around research data. Against this backdrop, the present article offers a conceptual discussion on the four academic openness paradigms, their meanings, interrelations, as well as potential benefits and challenges arising from their application in data-driven research.

AB  - The ever-increasing journal subscriptions have seen many universities and research institutions failing to provide access to the much-needed scholarship for propagation of research and development due to dwindling budget allocations. Hence, the adoption of open access (OA) institutional repositories (IR) by the institutions to increase access, availability and visibility of their research output to a wider readership. Institutional repository (IR) technologies have transformed the traditional academic library practice, thus upsetting the work culture of librarians. Though studies there have been studies on the impact of IRs on academic librarians elsewhere in the world, none have been done on the Zimbabwean context. This study draws from a wider study which explored utilisation of institutional repositories in Zimbabwe's public universities. The study sought to answer the question: What is the role of the academic librarian in promoting the institutional repository? The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of technology (UTAUT) informed the study, while a mixed methods approach was employed using document analysis, questionnaires and interviews to collect data from librarians in eight public universities. Findings revealed that in some instances IR responsibilities were added to existing duties for incumbent staff while in others, staff were reassigned to IR roles resulting in diverse staff categories maintaining the IRs across the universities. Recommendations for effective and efficient management of the repositories by the universities are made. The study is relevant to other academic libraries in developing countries and Africa particularly countries whose economies are crumbling.

Here, we zoom in on the first 300 RIO articles that have been published and elucidate how they relate to the different stages and variants of the research cycle, how they help address societal challenges and what forms of engagement have evolved around these resources, most of which have a nature and scope that would prevent them from entering the scholarly record via more traditional journals. Building on these observations, we describe some changes we recently introduced in the policies and peer review process at RIO to further facilitate engagement with the research process, including the establishment of an article collections feature that allows us to bring together research ideas and outcomes from within one research cycle or across multiple ones, irrespective of where they have been published.

AB  - Abstract This commentary explores the challenges and opportunities associated with a possible transition of Water Resources Research to a publication model where all articles are freely available upon publication (“Gold” open access). It provides a review of the status of open access publishing models, a summary of community input, and a path forward for AGU leadership. The decision to convert to open access is framed by a mix of finances and values. On the one hand, the challenge is to define who pays, and how, and what we can do to improve the affordability of publishing. On the other hand, the challenge is to increase the extent to which science is open and accessible. The next steps for the community include an incisive analysis of the financial feasibility of different cost models, and weighing the financial burden for open access against the desire to further advance open science.

AB  - Together with many other universities worldwide, the University of Göttingen has aimed to unlock the full potential of networked digital scientific communication by strengthening open access as early as the late 1990s. Open science policies at the institutional level consequently followed and have been with us for over a decade. However, for several reasons, their adoption often is still far from complete when it comes to the practices of researchers or research groups. To improve this situation at our university, there is dedicated support at the infrastructural level: the university library collaborates with several campus units in developing and running services, activities and projects in support of open access and open science. This article outlines our main activity areas and aligns them with the overall rationale to reach higher uptake and acceptance of open science practice at the university. The mentioned examples of our activities highlight how we seek to advance open science along the needs and perspectives of diverse audiences and by running it as a multi-stakeholder endeavor. Therefore, our activities involve library colleagues with diverse backgrounds, faculty and early career researchers, research managers, as well as project and infrastructure staff. We conclude with a summary of achievements and challenges to be faced.

TI  - OPERAS-PL development strategy for local open scholarly communication

AB  - OPERAS is a European consortium-based research infrastructure for the social sciences and humanities (SSH). It has been established as an non-commercial initiative aimed at transforming the European research area of scholarly communication and therefore it is targeted at researchers, librarians, publishers and infrastructure providers in over a dozen of European countries. This rich and diverse group of stakeholders is the key to OPERAS’s success. The proposed poster will discuss this leading idea on the example of the OPERAS-PL – the Polish national node of the infrastructure. Maintenance of infrastructures, or simply speaking: digital tools and services facilitating scholarly communication, is certainly one of the biggest challenges from the economic point of view (Edmond, 2020). However, the other challenging aspect is actually making truly useful, used and vivid tools, adjusting to stakeholders’ needs and fulfilling them (Anderson, 2013; van Zundert, 2012). One of OPERAS’s strategic plans for this to happen is the network of national nodes established in each of the partner countries (Consortium OPERAS, 2022). The nodes’ primary goal is to disseminate OPERAS services, attract users and involve new partners. However, their mission should be perceived wider. As national points of contact they actually may become the levers of the whole infrastructure’s development and perseverance – similarly to DARIAH-EU (the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) whose sustainability relies precisely on its scattered and bottom-up structure (Edmond, 2020). Our poster presents the development strategy for the Polish National Node OPERAS-PL, along with its mission, primary goals and milestones, targeted audiences, funding scheme, management methods and tools and risk mitigation. The strategy is analysed as a scalable model for similar initiatives which strive to enhance open scholarly practices in their respective communities. The poster builds on the recently launched project funded by the Polish Ministry of Education and Science and introduces two pilot research pursuits aiming at recognising the needs of the Polish SSH communities. The first pilot will study academic publishers’ needs in the field of open access. Through a design thinking technique we will recognise their needs and create a sustainability model for open access book publishing that will accomodate the specificity of Polish stakeholders. The second one will examine the potential of digital monographs as equivalent to traditional monographs in the Polish academic evaluation system. We will use our infrastructure for digital editions and adapt it to address the needs of book authors and publishers. The results of the pilots will be disseminated in the coming years at the Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing and other events.

AB  - Background: Although opinions of scientists about open access and the importance of their skills in information literacy have been investigated earlier but not, to our knowledge, of those in Croatia. Objective: The objective was to analyse the opinions on open access and on open-science practices before implementing open-science policies. Methods: Scientists at the University of Rijeka (N = 1256) were invited to complete, anonymously, an online questionnaire on open science (Google Forms) in 2020 and their responses were analysed. Results: Altogether 192 participants (a response rate 15%) were involved in this study, of which 110 (57%) were women. The mean age of the participants was 42 years (stand-ard deviation 11). The participants pursued careers in biomedical (37%), social (31%), or technical (14%) sciences; 20% were early-career researchers or postdoctoral research-ers, and 80% held the rank of assistant professor or higher. Most of them (88%) agreed that journals should be open access and 77% said they would choose the open-access journal if they had to choose between two journals with similar impact factors. Most (83%) considered publishing fees (article processing charges) to be too high; fewer than half (45%) considered the impact factor to be more important than open access; and 28% believed open access journals to be of lower quality. Nearly three-fourths (74%) had published at least one article in an open access journal, and 45%, without paying any fee. Only a few (10.9%) archived their articles in institutional or national repositories; more than a quarter (27%), on their web pages; and close to half (43%), on their social networks. To obtain papers not available to read online, more than half (56%) used Sci-Hub; slightly more than half (51%) wrote to the authors; 40% asked col-leagues for help; and 35% approached a librarian. Conclusions: Most of the scientists in our study were in favour of open access but con-sidered the publication fees to be too high. Their archiving was inadequate: few used any institutional or national repositories. Therefore, the scientists need to be more information literate and require guidance and help from librarians and will benefit from training in information literacy including the principles of open access.

AB  - Beginning in 2011, there have been several policy changes directly affecting the management, preservation, and accessibility of publically funded research and resulting research data in the United States. On January 18, 2011 the National Science Foundation (NSF) required data management plans to be submitted with all grant proposals (National Science Foundation, 2013). On February 22, 2013, the Office of Science and Technology Policy of the President of the United States extended a similar requirement to all federal agencies that have a research and development budget of more than $100 million (Holdren, 2013). These requirements illustrate the need for further coordination and management of data as scholarship and traditional scholarship in integrated publishing solutions.

AB  - This article summarizes the results of a short survey completed by 94 publishers, librarians and suppliers within the international scholarly publishing community in early 2017. From a selection of 13 categories included as a multi-choice pick-list, each with additional sub-categories – a total of 57 options – the participants identified the functions they are currently outsourcing and provided a forecast of those they are considering outsourcing in the future. The survey found the top sub-category function currently outsourced across all three stakeholder groups to be ‘Content hosting/technology platform’ (one of seven sub-categories associated under the parent category 6: ‘IT – Hosting/content’), which was selected by a total of 18 survey respondents. The survey provided new insights into the issue of outsourcing in the scholarly communications field, and the author invites further participation to build on these initial findings.

AB  - The business model of paid publishers for scientific journals has been criticized for various reasons, including the potential for financial gain to take precedence over the advancement of science. Some argue that this model restricts access to critical scientific research, particularly for those who cannot afford expensive journal subscriptions, hindering the progress of science.

AB  - This study draws on the authors' first-hand experience of designing, developing and delivering (3Ds) a massive open online course (MOOC) entitled 'Understanding Research Methods' since 2014, largely but not exclusively for learners in the humanities and social sciences. The greatest challenge facing us was to design an assessment mechanism that was (i) rigorous yet practicable at scale, vis-à-vis over 60,000 students from highly diverse backgrounds; (ii) compatible with the pedagogical orientation of the MOOC provider; and (iii) meaningful to the nature of the course subject. Based on a network analysis of forum interactions and a qualitative analysis of a random sample of 116 research questions proposed by students, we explore how participants' understanding of research methods developed through a series of carefully sequenced 'e-tivities' and 'open peer assessments' over the duration of the course. The aim of this study was to consider a model of 'flipped' assessment, drawn from elements of 'paragogy' and the IR Model that acknowledges and exploits peer learning opportunities that are not routinely captured by completion statistics.

AB  - ABSTRACT Stakeholders from academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishing are increasingly investing in open data partially in the hope that it will democratize science and promote more diverse data reuse. However, fewer studies examine how unconventional communities outside academia and industry use open data. Through an investigative digital ethnography, I observed the data practices of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) skeptics, specifically how they discuss, evaluate, and reuse open data. This poster focuses on the knowledge infrastructure that affords the data practices of ACC skeptics. I argue that ACC skeptics are building a parasitic knowledge infrastructure on the back of the climate science knowledge infrastructure it often seeks to discredit. Understanding the infrastructure that supports skeptics' data reuse can inform how we design policies and infrastructure to actualize open data's promises while minimizing its perils.

AB  - Education for Instruction Librarians has traditionally centered upon the acquisition of practical classroom skills.While this approach has merit, from a sociocultural perspective of learning, student development emerges more completely through engagement with the communal activities and values that constitute professional practices rather than through the achievement of individual competencies.Drawing upon these understandings, this paper reports on the experiences of an Open Access writing assignment that was librarian-reviewed.The assignment was designed to build student participation within Instruction Librarian practices and communities.Focused upon the 19 student and 19 librarian-reviewer experiences (38 total) of the assignment, the survey-based methodology that is used in this study reveals a lack of communication between student and practitioner Instruction Librarians as well as the importance of the assignment to both student and librarian learning.These findings demonstrate that developing student access to professional practices and communities can be beneficial for students as well as for Instruction Librarians.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide a review of recent trends in the open access (OA) movement, as well as to discuss the significance of those trends for information access in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach An analysis of the recent literature was carried out, focusing on the benefits of a greater information access in developing countries. The paper also brings together the diverse experiences from the authors on OA publishing and archiving with institutions in a number of developing countries. Findings Knowledge workers in developing countries are now getting access to scholarly and scientific publications and electronic resources at a level that is unmatched historically. This is highly significant, if developing countries are to meet the millennium development goals. The OA movement and the growing number of Open Archive Initiative‐compliant institutional repositories promise to provide even greater access to resources and publications that were previously inaccessible. These low cost technology and interoperability standards are providing great opportunities for libraries and publishers in developing countries to disseminate local research and to bridge the south‐north knowledge gap. Originality/value This paper therefore provides recommendations for knowledge workers on how to actively participate in and contribute to the global knowledge commons. The results and recommendations contained in the paper should be of interest to authors, policy makers, funding agencies and information professionals in both developing and developed countries.

AB  - A partnership forged between the George A. Smathers Libraries at the University of Florida and the Florida State Horticultural Society (FSHS) advances access to current and historical publications of the society and exemplifies an opportunity for agricultural librarians. The Public Knowledge Project's Open Journal System (OJS) was developed by librarians at Simon Fraser and Stanford universities to offer free, web-based publication software that promotes open access to journals and supports editorial workflow and publication needs. Collaborations among libraries and content creators that utilize open source tools like OJS are especially beneficial for agricultural organizations with limited financial and staffing resources. This paper examines the current state of library publishing partnerships with external organizations through analysis of survey data collected by the authors, and shares lessons learned from an example partnership. In this example librarians contributed their expertise in peer-review publishing, intellectual property rights, and institutional repositories to develop a customized online journal site using OJS for FSHS in a manner that reflects the publication workflow of the society. Customized features include branding, peer review, member subscription, full-text indexing, and access to archived issues. Trainings on OJS and digital publication service empower subject-area librarians to serve as points of contact for additional collaborations. Utilizing OJS in partnerships between libraries and content creators enhances the relevancy of the library and subject-area librarians while promoting greater access to agricultural information.

AB  - It was while drafting an editorial on the timely subject of publishing ethics that it first came to light that Biology Open (BiO) was one of the journals that received as a submission a spoof article devised by a journalist working for the journal Science (Bohannon, 2013). The article was described as being obviously flawed to any competent scientist. 304 spoof articles were submitted to Open Access (OA) journals worldwide, including BiO: at the time the Science report was published, 157 of the journals had accepted the paper and 98 had rejected it. Reassuringly, the handling editor at BiO had editorially rejected the article.There has been much discussion of this ‘sting’ within the science and publishing community. In particular, several commentators have highlighted and questioned why only OA journals were tested in this way; there was no control to test the rate of acceptance of the spoof paper in non-OA journals, even though these findings have been (and were perhaps intended to be) interpreted by some as proof that OA publishing is in some way inherently flawed.Although BiO seems to have passed some sort of test (and, in fact, has a rejection rate of about 50%), no journal can afford to be complacent. The soundness of BiO's peer review process and associated ethical practices will continue to be a key focus of its editors, and now seems a good time to reiterate some of the principles that guide our editorial policy.Unbiased, independent, critical assessment is of vital importance in scholarly publishing (Raff, 2013). BiO aims to provide rapid peer-reviewed publication of scientifically sound observations and conclusions. Reviewers are asked to confirm that the experimental work is properly conducted and that the conclusions are adequately supported by the data. We do not require any assessment of the significance, relative importance or impact of a paper, as we believe this will gradually emerge post-publication. Therefore, we ask reviewers to simply address the following criteria:We are currently implementing the addition of a new acceptance criterion – that the methods used are described in sufficient detail to allow proper repetition of the experiments. Recent articles have highlighted failures in the reliability and reproducibility of published research (e.g. http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility) and we believe that it is important to tackle this issue.Over the past decade or so, many initiatives and codes of practice have been established within the scientific publishing community. Many now feel routine (such as having dotted lines between spliced gel lanes), whereas others continue to evolve. The Company of Biologists is a member of COPE, The Committee on Publication Ethics (http://publicationethics.org). When the decision was made to launch BiO, it was the COPE guidelines and codes of practice that were employed. In addition, BiO follows the International Committee of Medical Journal Editor's (http://www.icmje.org) recommendations for the “conduct, reporting, editing and publication of scholarly work in medical journals”.Among the many important practices that have been instituted is the publication of Conflict of Interest and Author Contribution statements. The policies briefly described below have been devised in conjunction with our academic partners to ensure the accurate, timely, fair and ethical peer review and publication of scientific papers submitted to BiO.Adjustment of digital images with computer software is acceptable. However, the final image must remain representative of the original data. BiO checks figures for evidence of image manipulation (Rossner and Yamada, 2004). In addition, the corresponding author is required to certify at submission that they are aware of all manipulations performed on any digital images that accompany their article.A competing or conflict of interest is anything that might (or might be perceived to) inappropriately influence (bias) the full and objective presentation, review or publication of research findings. Competing interests can be financial, professional or personal, and can be held by authors, their employers, sponsors of the work, reviewers, Editors and editorial staff.BiO requires that a Conflict of Interest statement be included in each article, even if this is used to declare that there are no conflicts. Authors must include information regarding the provider of financial and material support of their research in the Funding section. Reviewers, Editors and Editorial staff are also required to disclose financial or professional associations that might interfere with their objectivity.Recent discussions have focused on the evolving issue of authorship. BiO requires that authors include a statement in the manuscript that specifies the contributions of each author. An author is someone who has made significant and substantial contributions to a study. These should include conception, design, execution and interpretation of the data being published, and preparing the article.The ICMJE has recently proposed a new criterion for authorship. This states that an author must “be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. In addition to being accountable for the parts of the work he or she has done, an author should be able to identify which co-authors are responsible for specific other parts of the work. In addition, authors should have confidence in the integrity of the contributions of their co-authors.” This has prompted discussion of the genuine feasibility of this, in particular with regards to large multi-centre research.The BiO submission process is set by default to ensure that all authors are included in relevant editorial correspondence. Papers must be submitted with the agreement of all authors, and all authors must approve the version to be published. However, this can't always protect the journal from those intent on perpetrating misconduct, such as using fake but active and plausible email addresses for co-authors who may not be aware that an article has been submitted in their name – to use one actual example.Despite the policies, checks and balances that have been implemented, it can be difficult to identify and block papers that include flawed work or outright fraudulent data. Although BiO passed the spoof paper ‘test’, we will continue to review our role in maintaining the integrity of the scientific record.

AB  - Lay summarization aims to simplify complex scientific information for non-expert audiences. This paper investigates the trade-off between readability and relevance in the lay summarization of long biomedical documents. We introduce a two-stage framework that attains the best readability metrics in the first subtask of BioLaySumm 2023, with 8.924 FleschKincaid Grade Level and 9.188 DaleChall Readability Score. However, this comes at the cost of reduced relevance and factuality, emphasizing the inherent challenges of balancing readability and content preservation in lay summarization. The first stage generates summaries using a large language model, such as BART with LSG attention. The second stage uses a zero-shot sentence simplification method to improve the readability of the summaries. In the second subtask, a hybrid dataset is employed to train a model capable of generating both lay summaries and abstracts. This approach achieves the best readability score and shares the top overall rank with other leading methods. Our study underscores the importance of developing effective methods for creating accessible lay summaries while maintaining information integrity. Future work will integrate simplification and summary generation within a joint optimization framework that generates high-quality lay summaries that effectively communicate scientific content to a broader audience.

AB  - Academic libraries which are considered to be nerve centers of academic and research activities must help achieve the academic goals of their parent institutions and this is possible only through developing adequate library collection and/or providing seamless and wider access to relevant electronic resources.Chukwu (1998) maintains that the major indicator of a good library is the quality and quantity of its collections.It is necessary for university libraries to acquire current and relevant information resources necessary for sustaining the teaching, learning, and research activities that universities are known for.This paper chiefly investigates the trends in collection development activities in university and college libraries.Further the contemporary changes in scholarly publishing and advances in Information and Communication technologies are posing challenges to library professionals in developing and making them accessible to the end users.This article describes briefly the impact of electronic publishing on collection development in libraries.It also examines the status and management of electronic resources in academic libraries surveyed and enlists the challenges before library professionals in the changed context.It also explores the kind of collaborative initiatives taken up by these libraries and the perceptions of the library professionals on collaborative collection development I.Introduction:Collection development is one of the important and challenging library management activity.Collection development is a process of selecting, ordering and payment of information materials for the use of the users in the library (Olaojo and Akewukekere ,2006).Based on this, collection development helps to enhance the assemblage and provision of a variety of information materials to meet the desperate need of library users.Nnadozie (2006) described collection development as a planned, continuous and cost effective acquisition of quality and relevant materials to meet the needs of the users and objectives of the university libraries.Collection development is concerned with the formulation of a systematic plan to build a library collection which will meet the needs of its users.It encompasses a number of activities related to the development of the library's collection including the determination and coordination of selection policy, assessment of current and potential user needs, collection use studies, collection evaluation, identification of collection needs, selection of materials, planning of resource sharing, collection maintenance and weeding (Gorman and Howes, 1989;Clayton and Gorman, 2001). II. Review of literatureThe review of literature reveals the findings of number of studies on various aspects of collection development.Forecasting the impact of electronic environment and the economic forces on collection development, Harole and Budd (1994) felt that together they create a new environment, where access to collective scholarly resources that no library could be ever afford, supersedes the historic quest for the great comprehensive collection.Ifidon (1997) maintains that library objectives and philosophy must be taken into consideration in collection development, emphasizing that the areas of interest and concerns of library users are paramount.Nwafor (1997) discovered that a low level of funding of university libraries had led to the deterioration in the quality of library collections.Akobo (1998) discovered that problems facing library collections in Nigeria include foreign exchange restrictions, economic recession, and the large population of students.Evans(2000) stressed the need to have a collection development policy in the context of hybrid collections to delineates the purpose and contents of a collection relevant to its users as a whole.Further a well written Collection Development Policy typically identifies subject areas in which it may be preferable to have one format over another (Lee and Wu, 2002).Ononogbo (2003) discovered that 91 percent of the collection in the library being studied was derived from donations, gifts, and bequests.A collection development policy is therefore needed that delineates the purpose and contents of a collection relevant to its users as a whole (Evans, 2000; Futas, 1984)

AB  - This article investigates the developments during the last decades in the use of languages, publication types and publication channels in the social sciences and humanities (SSH). The purpose is to develop an understanding of the processes of internationalization and to apply this understanding in a critical examination of two often used general criteria in research evaluations in the SSH. One of them is that the coverage of a publication in Scopus or Web of Science is seen in itself as an expression of research quality and of internationalization. The other is that a specific international language, English, and a specific type of publication, journal articles, are perceived as supreme in a general hierarchy of languages and publication types. Simple distinctions based on these criteria are contrary to the heterogeneous publication patterns needed in the SSH to organize their research adequately, present their results properly, reach their audiences efficiently, and thereby fulfil their missions. Research quality, internationalization, and societal relevance can be promoted in research assessment in the SSH without categorical hierarchies of publications. I will demonstrate this by using data from scholarly publishing in the SSH that go beyond the coverage in the commercial data sources in order to give a more comprehensive representation of scholarly publishing in the SSH.

AB  - Payment for publication is an increasingly prevalent component of the scholarly publishing landscape, and librarians have a professional requirement to be aware of the current situation. This paper explores this phenomenon, including an analysis of what is being charged for publication. Comparisons between the different types of open access publishing, in fully open access and in hybrid journals, show the considerably higher costs of hybrid open access. Despite this discrepancy there remain issues with the discoverability of some hybrid open access articles. Payment for publication is changing the funding base for scholarly publication therefore broadening the administrative areas responsible for management of the system. New relationships between players across the sector need to be developed and fostered. To participate in this changing landscape librarians need knowledge of the source of institutional and government funds for article processing charges and these funding bodies' approaches to funding hybrid. New offerings from publishers, such as membership schemes and mega journals further complicate the situation, not helped by challenges in obtaining data about what is being spent in this area. This increasingly complex situation potentially expands the role of libraries within institutions into the future, which is preferable to becoming irrelevant.

AB  - ABSTRACT In support of investigating the effects of systematic archiving of authors' final peer‐reviewed, accepted manuscripts (green open access), PEER has developed a robust observatory infrastructure which has already successfully processed over 44,000 manuscripts. Technical challenges successfully overcome by the project include non‐uniformity of manuscript files and metadata formats, embargo management, and author authentication for repository deposit. Three areas of research investigating (i) author and reader attitudes and behaviours, (ii) article‐level usage at repositories and publisher platforms, and (iii) the economics of large‐scale archiving have been commissioned and are producing results. The baseline behavioural survey identified an increasing general awareness of open access, but a lower awareness of institutional and subject repositories. Perceptions were also found to vary depending on whether individuals were responding from an author or reader perspective. PEER itself has seen low uptake from authors when invited to self‐deposit into the project. Further results from all three research areas are due before the project ends in May 2012.

AB  - Scholarly peer review (also known as refereeing or reviewing) is defined as the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal, conference proceedings, book chapter, or as an entire book. The peer review process helps the publisher (ie, the editor-in-chief, the editorial board, or the program committee) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer reviews improve the quality of scholarly publishing, and indirectly, the quality of the research behind it. All legitimate academic journals that publish research reports depend on peer review as a means of assuring the quality of the articles that they publish. But the process has far wider implications than that. Universities commonly view an academic's published research record as the main criterion for reaching decisions related to promotions and tenure. No matter how much they may say about the importance of teaching effectiveness, academic publishing is usually the overriding determinant for career progression. Accordingly, everything associated with the publishing process is a matter of concern for career-minded researchers. There are other issues surrounding academic publishing that researchers need to understand well, including electronic publishing and open access, and they are reported well elsewhere, but peer review remains critical in all such debates. However, whilst the process is nowhere near perfect and has many critics, it remains the primary means for determining the important issue of whether a research manuscript should be published, and it should, therefore, be made as good as it can be for the sake of the journals, as well as for the careers of their authors. Peer review is carried out by scholars who have been recognised as experts in their fields. They will normally have already published several journal and/or conference papers, thereby coming to the attention of journal editors. Being invited by a journal or conference to perform peer reviews is, therefore, a worthy achievement and a valuable milestone in an academic career. However, it is possible that few such individuals will have received much training or mentoring in the review process, particularly in niche areas of academia. Indeed, receiving and responding to reviews of their own manuscripts may have been their only formal exposure to it. However, there are many resources available that outline the review process and the major publishers and journals provide reviewing guidelines and, in some cases, provide feedback to reviewers on their performance. As scholars, we have all benefited from peer review and, therefore, we have at least a moral obligation to pay forward that favour to those following behind us in the development of their careers. Moreover, if you are good at reviewing, there is a better chance of ultimately being invited to take up an editorial role in the journal that you review for, which is another worthy achievement and valuable milestone in terms of career progression. Without wishing to prescribe too heavily a format for a standard review, the following is a checklist that we have developed over the years to help prepare a review that is as comprehensive as it can be. If reviewers follow this checklist, it is highly probable that they can be confident that their review will be to the same standard. If authors are aware of the criteria against which their work is being judged, they will be better prepared to meet those criteria. This is by no means the only checklist. You can also find published examples of guides to reviewing, including: Lee (1995); Davison, de Vreede, and Briggs (2005). Wiley, the publisher of this journal, also has its own resources for reviewers here: https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/index.html. The manuscript is sufficiently detailed to permit a reader: The manuscript treats ethical issues adequately: The references are appropriate and up to date (see also Tarafdar & Davison, 2020). When authors receive a review, there is a specific process to follow. Please remember that the reviewers are freely giving their time for your benefit. Out of respect for them, it is important that you consider their review comments carefully. In principle, you should either expect to revise the manuscript following their advice, or if you disagree with the advice, then explain your reasoning carefully. If the reviewers contradict each other, the Senior Editor should provide advice on how to respond. If that advice is absent, you should contact the Senior Editor to request it. With respect to the mechanics of reporting how you have revised the article, there are a number of steps to take that will make both your life and that of the reviewers easier. First, you should prepare a table with three columns. The left column should contain a sequence number to indicate which comment is being addressed. The middle column contains the comment from each reviewer. In the right column, next to each comment, you should describe your response to the comment. This may be in the form of some revision to the manuscript, or, if you disagree with the comment, your justification for so doing. Preparing your response in this way is a big help for the reviewer, who is unlikely to relish re-reading the manuscript looking for the changes you have made and determining how they relate to the comments in each of the reviews. If you just say, “see page 6, para 2,” or words to that effect, this will not endear yourself to the reviewer. See Table 1 below for an example of how to create this table of revision notes. To conclude, experienced reviewers and journal editors will probably agree that as a reviewer the more you put into conducting a review, the more you will get back from conducting it. Likewise, as an author, the more attention you pay to your responses to reviews, the more likely it will be that your manuscript will be published.

AB  - Scholarly journals provide a record of the research, issues, and concerns of a field. Authors have their names associated with their individual articles, while editors are connected with a publication. However, there is another group of individuals who are often left out of the record, although their contributions are just as critical in the formation of scholarly journals. This article will take a look at this group of peer reviewers, to provide demographic data as well as understanding for the reasons individuals take on the duty of peer reviewer.

AB  - Evening trails by Brian Smithson. Shared from https://www.flickr.com/photos/smithser/10709730483/ under a CC BY 2.0 license Peer Review involves several divergent groups. Authors, who wish to see the results of scrupulous work published, in the anticipation of career promotion or secure funding. Editors, who are under pressure to identify sound and novel research. Reviewers, who try to fit a thoughtful and time-consuming process within busy schedules, often receiving no credit for it. And Publishers, who compete in a transforming landscape of fast and abundant science publishing. But has Peer Review always been as challenging as it is nowadays? Some might argue so, though phrases such as 'Publish or Perish', or the 'Impact Factor rat race' are relatively new additions to a Researcher's vocabulary. Moreover, the frequently observed focus of science policies on short-term goals and the publication speed enabled or even imposed by our information age are all new variables. Worryingly, advances in online handling systems have actually enabled author and reviewer misconduct, as in the recent case of 101 papers that went through fake peer review according to the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [1]. This scenery is by no means comparable to the scientific landscape of 1960s when regular Peer Review was first introduced by journals [2, 3]. Although several changes have been introduced to the Peer Review system to address current challenges, the Peer Review Process has been until recently preserved in its primary version: metadata on Peer Review efficiency have been scarcely available; implementation of emerging technologies to detect issues such as inappropriate statistical analysis, figure manipulation and data fabrication has been limited; Peer Reviewers lack systematic training on conducting constructive and ethical peer review; and incentives for performing high-quality peer review are often scarce. However, this scenery is now changing, and the first steps towards Peer Review modernization have already been made! The realization that systematic research on Peer Review needs to be conducted is growing. Already in July 2017, Carole J. Lee and David Moher, philosophers specializing in Publication Science at the University of Washington and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, respectively, published in Science a call for promoting scientific integrity via research on Peer Review [4]. Lee and Moher call Publishers to enable the opening of what they name 'the black box of peer review'. They highlight the need for large systematic experimental studies to assess the various peer review practices and improve quality and transparency. Going a step further, they present incentives for Publishers to adopt new software systems for assisting Peer Review, evaluating Peer Review Efficiency and producing metadata on, for example, reviewer scores and comments linked to manuscript content, or reviewer expertise and affiliations. The suggested incentives are hard to ignore: taking into consideration the persisting plea to de-emphasize impact factor, as well as the need to exclude predatory journals, introduction of indicators for Peer Review transparency will soon gain momentum. The wide application of indicators for Peer Review transparency would provide strong incentives for a Publishers' initiative to support research that improves the quality of the Peer Review process. Such a collective initiative could even be supported through updating the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines to facilitate journal meta-research. One might argue that this is yet another idealistic call. However, reality might disprove them. The upcoming International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication, which was launched by JAMA and BMJ back in 1986 to encourage systematic research on Peer Review [5, 6], features a rich programme on metadata analysis, and will host several journal editors and publisher representatives. This is only an indication that the community is responsive to the general need for metadata analysis of Peer Review. In addition, the implementation of Open Peer Review by several publishers increases metadata availability. Through Open Peer Review the identities of both Authors and Reviewers are made public upon manuscript acceptance, often along with the Peer Review reports. EMBO Press journals and Nature Communications publish reviewer reports along with manuscripts on an optional basis [7, 8]. Similarly, BMJ [9], F1000Research [10] and about 70 journals from BioMed Central [11], all use variable models of Open Peer Review but share a common feature: they publish reviewer reports and names alongside the published article. In addition, Publishers are engaging in lively discussions on the future of Peer Review. For example, in 2016, BioMed Central and Digital Science organized a 1-day conference, the SpotOn London event, at which participants actively discussed 'what peer review might look like in 2030'. This event led to the production of an informative report [12], and will hopefully help trigger more discussions, when repeated later this year. In parallel, Chris Graf, Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics Director at Wiley, has recently indicated openness to change: 'our plan at Wiley […] includes continuous work […] to collect and record data on trends [and] Editorial initiatives and experiments designed to improve transparency and openness, and thus reproducibility. We are pleased to be an organizational signatory to the TOP guidelines. We publish several journals – the European Journal of Neuroscience in particular – that are leading proponents for 'two-stage' peer review adopted in the Registered Reports model. We will continue to encourage and support journals that experiment with this model, and others like it' [13]. So, it seems that publishers are ready for a change. Most importantly, they are not alone in this effort. Policy makers also seem to recognize the need for systematic research on Peer Review. For example, the EU has initiated the COST Action 'PEERE: New frontiers of peer review'. PEERE is a multidisciplinary international project running from 2014 to 2018 that involves quantitative and qualitative research on how peer review is conducted, seeking to make evidence-based recommendations for improving the current system. Thorough Peer Review seems to obstruct fast publication and vice versa. However, when it comes to time limitations faced by both Reviewers and Journal Editors, several emerging technologies can lend a helping hand. Some Publishers have already integrated technologies to waterproof the Peer Review Process: AAAS has recently launched a new web-based service, Peer Review Evaluation (PRE), that ensures adherence to journal Peer-Review policy, excluding fake or biased reports [14]. Probably most people engaged in Publishing have heard of Crossref, a web-based tool widely used to detect plagiarism issues, among other purposes. Similar technologies already exist to screen manuscripts for statistical credibility, image integrity and, even, data fabrication. Penelope was first conceived by its creator James Harwood as a web-based tool that would assist authors to adhere to guidelines when preparing a manuscript [15]. Upon collaboration with the equator network, the startup company Penelope Research has developed a product that might transform the future of Peer Review. Penelope is presently available to Publishers for checking manuscripts during submission. The checking includes, among others, the presence of appropriate formatting, the figure and table legends, references, or ethical statements. Importantly, Penelope checks for proper statistical analysis and can identify cases in which raw data of a manuscript had been previously published elsewhere. StatReviewer has recently emerged as another promising tool to assist the review of manuscripts for statistical soundness. It uses machine learning to control adherence to widely accepted statistical and methodological guidelines, such as CONSORT 2010. StatReviewer is currently being evaluated in an initial pilot study involving four clinical BioMed Central journals [16]. Would these developments mean that we are heading towards a fully automated Peer-Review system? As Chadwick C. DeVoss, Founder and President of StatReviewer argues in the 2016 SpotOn London report, 'this is where a slippery slope gets extra slippery' [12]. A fully-automated publishing line would only undermine exchange and communication between researchers. On the contrary, the aim here is solely to implement emerging technologies as a helping tool that will leave authors and reviewers valuable time for rewarding interactions. Researchers are being thoroughly trained for conceiving a project and experimenting in a wet or dry lab. Most postgraduate students also receive regular training on writing a manuscript and preparing scientific presentations. But what about conducting Peer Review? Considering the major impact of reviewing quality on scholarly publishing, minimal concerted efforts have been so far invested on training good Reviewers. With advice mainly restricted to journal guidelines and some editorials, budding Peer Reviewers seem to be in need of more support when expected to produce a good referee report. More than that, there is still an open debate on whether young PostDocs should be given the possibility for getting some hands-on experience with Peer Review. Lack of opportunities for young scientists to train on supervised Peer Review is rather unfortunate given the fact that most are open to both expanding their expertise and investing time on a scientific exchange as rewarding as Peer Review. Yet, both individual journal initiatives and a new platform dedicated to Peer Review have set the goal of changing this scenery. For example, the Genetics Society of America has just initiated a pilot programme for training reviewers on the 'principles, purposes, and best practices of Peer Review'. Other Publishers opt for providing online packages with Peer Review training Material, including Webinars, as is the case with the Wiley Peer Review training. Going one step further, Publons, a platform focusing on Peer Review and aimed at Authors, Reviewers, Editors and Publishers alike, has developed the Publons Academy, a practical Peer Review training course for early career researchers. Publons Academy not only provides extensive material on evaluating novelty, methods, results, conclusions and ethical integrity in a manuscript but also enables supervised postpublication Peer Review. Experienced Reviewers are encouraged to sign up as supervisors and get acknowledged for this role. Acknowledgement is actually the groundbreaking component that has already earned Publons a constantly growing community of Reviewers, Editors and Journals. Reviewers get credit for every single report they prepare (even when the manuscript does not get accepted for publication). This sole fact is crucial for transforming Peer Review: as indicated in a survey conducted by Wiley, four of five researchers agree that reviewing is not sufficiently acknowledged by journals and research institutions [17]. With the ambition to transform this landscape, Publons provides credit, in the form of a verified peer review record, that can be considered as credential during internal institute evaluations, or at job and grant applications. The provision of such incentives may help to build a universal reviewer database. Such a database would assist journals to expand their pool of Reviewers that currently seems to be biased towards senior, male, American and European researchers, and is by no means representative of the current researcher and author demographics. Several developments occurring in parallel seem to steer towards a brand new future for the Peer-Review process. Whether this is an optimistic or realistic view, we are all to find out soon. But what are the actual views of researchers on burning questions about Peer Review transparency, quality and recognition? In times of change, it is essential for the main players to become vocal and put forward criticism and suggestions for solution. How do Reviewers view models of open Peer Review to ensure transparency? Do Authors and Reviewers welcome the use of emerging technologies as a part of the peer review process for the sake of faster publication? What do they consider as nonreplaceable values of nonautomated Peer Review? Do Authors profit from Peer Review more than is generally admitted and acknowledged? How do early career investigators feel about their inclusion in this system? Are senior researchers that have experienced the evolution of the Peer Review System over the past 20 years prepared to supervise younger colleagues? The debate is still on, and the more views available, the more can the system improve.

AB  - This study has established the perceived benefits and barriers of using online journal systems (OJS). A descriptive research design alongside a quantitative approach was used to establish perceived benefits and barriers of using online journal systems among University of Dar es Salaam faculty members. In the study data were gathered through survey questionnaires. The data were then organized and summarized through descriptive statistics in form of frequencies and percentages. The study reveals that a significant number of faculty members infrequently use the systems in their scholarly communication. Along this, the study reveals various benefits of using OJS as perceived by faculty members. The study also reveals diverse perceived barriers that undermine effective use of the systems. These include low internet bandwidth and technical difficulties. The study recommends that the UDSM has to take deliberate measures to enhance internet services through increasing bandwidth, alongside increasing training on the use of online journal systems.

AB  - 최근 학술커뮤니케이션에 나타난 변화 중 괄목할 만한 것이 '오픈액세스(Open Access)인데, 세계적으로 정보공유를 위한 연구자들의 참여와 학계와 정부에서의 지원 정책 발표가 이어면서 서구를 중심으로 급속히 확산되고 있다. 정보공유에 있어서 가장 중요한 것은 정보의 생산자이면서 소비자인 연구자들의 참여의지와 인식이다. 따라서 연구성과 정보의 공유에 대한 인식 조사는 대단히 긴요하다. 본 조사는 특정 주제 분야의 연구자들을 대상으로 오픈액세스 환경에 대한 인식도를 조사하였다. 이 조사를 바탕으로 오픈액세스 환경에서 이슈가 되고 있는 저작권 문제를 조명하였다. 결과적으로 국내 연구자들에게 있어서 '오픈액세스'에 대한 인식은 아직은 미비한 것으로 나타난 반면, 저작권이 침해되지 않는 범위 내에서 명확한 출처를 밝히고 합법적인 목적으로 연구물을 사용한다면 오픈액세스 활동에 참여할 의사를 가지고 있는 것으로 조사되었다. 이러한 결과를 바탕으로 이 논문에서는 저작권과 라이선스의 마련, 그리고 산재한 연구성과물의 원활한 관리와 접근 및 활용을 극대화시킬 수 있는 연구정보관리 체제의 구축이 필요함을 밝혔다. The purpose of this study is to scrutinize the copyright issue under Open Access environment. A survey has been carried out to investigate researchers' awareness and recognitions about such issues. For this, bioinformatics researchers were selected and surveyed. Descriptive statistics method is employed for analysis of collected data. The findings of this study summarized as follow. (1) Although the researchers regarded the Open Access a positive initiative, the perceptions about open access were very low. (2) The researchers demanded possession of copyright depending on type of research information. (3) Many agencies did not required the transfer of copyright to the researcher. Thus, there is a possibility of dispute regarding copyright issues between researchers and agencies. (4) The researchers are willing to participate in open access activity on the assumption that their study is used in legitimate objective. On the basis of these findings, suggestions are added in as an impetus to lower the barrier against a copyright and higher the approach to information seekers and information providers.

AB  - Abstract Pillars of open science are often included within the editorial policies of scholarly journals, including policies on open access publication, availability of underlying research data, preprints and open peer review. The aim of this paper is to examine and analyse perceptions and editorial practices related to open access, preprints, open research data and open peer review, from the perspective of editors of scientific journals published in Spain, to gain an insight into editorial policies related to open science. Results and data were obtained by a combined method of online interviews and an online questionnaire. The online survey was sent to editors from journals indexed in the Dulcinea directory, which at the time of the study included 1875 academic journals. A total of 420 responses (22.4%) were obtained. The results indicated that 92% of the journals were open access journals, 2% of the journals conducted open peer review, 15% of the journals had instructions to allow archiving preprints, and out of 375 responses, only 59 journals (16%) reported having a policy on underlying research data. Based on these results, there is a trend in favour of open access, but the perceived barriers to open peer review outweighed the advantages. There is also some reluctance to allow preprints to be made available. This concern might be because editors want authors and readers to read and cite the contents published in their journals, rather than their preprint versions.

AB  - Journals play a pivotal role in disseminating scientific knowledge, housing a multitude of valuable research articles. In this digital age, the evaluation of journals and their quality is essential. The SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) stands as one of the prominent platforms for ranking journals, categorizing them into five index classes: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and NQ. Determining these index classes often relies on classification methodologies. This research, drawing inspiration from the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), seeks to employ the Random Forest method to classify journals, thus contributing to the refinement of journal ranking processes. Random Forest stands out as a robust choice due to its remarkable ability to mitigate overfitting, a common challenge in machine learning classification tasks. In the context of approximating SJR index classes, Random Forest, when utilizing the Gini index, exhibits promise, albeit with an initial accuracy rate of 62.12%. The Gini index, an impurity measure, enables Random Forest to make informed decisions while classifying journals into their respective SJR index classes. However, it is worth noting that this accuracy rate represents a starting point, and further refinement and feature engineering may enhance the model's performance. This research underscores the significance of machine learning techniques in the domain of journal classification and journal-ranking systems. By harnessing the power of Random Forest, this study aims to facilitate more accurate and efficient categorization of journals, thereby aiding researchers, academics, and institutions in identifying and accessing high-quality scientific literature.

AB  - Persistent identification of entities plays a major role in the progress of digitization of many fields. In the scholarly publishing realm there are already persistent identifiers (PID) for papers (DOI), people (ORCID), organisation (GRID, ROR), books (ISBN) but there is no generally accepted PID system for scholarly events such as conferences or workshops yet. This article describes the relevant use cases that motivate the introduction of persistent identifiers for conferences. The use cases were mainly derived from interviews, discussions with experts and their previous work. As primary stakeholders who are involved in the typical conference event life cycle researchers, conference organizers, and data consumers were identified. The resulting list of use cases illustrates how PIDs for conference events will improve the current situation for these stakeholders and help with problems they are facing today.

AB  - Medical journals are dull; I do not think there is any doubt about that. —Richard Asher, M.D., F.R.C.P.1 In 1958, Dr. Richard Asher wrote in the British Medical Journal that “medical journals are dull.”1 Among the laundry list of offenses of the publication's format was that “their wrappings [were] so drab and difficult to remove, so the journals accumulate on our desks in inconvenient piles and roll on to the floor.” Over half a century later, we feel the medical and publishing communities have succeeded in making our distinguished journals more to our readers' liking. Much of this success has to do with our journals' growing roles on the Internet, but it was not an easy evolution. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery's first Web site, while a major leap forward, suffered from some of the same symptoms that Asher posited were driving people away from reading journals. Using Asher's example as analogy, our first Web site itself could be considered the “wrappings” to our content; it was the hard-to-manipulate shell that left our online Journal remaining unread somewhere on our readers' computer desktops. The content was superb, as always, but our users could not access it in intuitive, easy, interactive ways, and therefore the content risked going unread. In July of 2009, PRSJournal.com officially became a member of the new, interactive, community-based Web 2.0 that arose after the dot com bust. Stagnant information on a Web page would no longer do; Web sites had to work for their users, not just sit in digital piles. As Kent Anderson, editor-in-chief of the Society for Scholarly Publishing's blog, Scholarly Kitchen, said in 2008, Web 2.0 environments do not just “shovel documents online … [they] bring people and experiences online.”2 Web 2.0 environments such as the new PRSJournal.com keep online journals from succumbing to digital “dullness.” PRSJournal.com underwent a revolutionary transformation when the site was transferred to our publisher's new LWW Journals Web Platform. Once placed on this new platform, immediate changes allowed our Web site, the journal of record, to provide end users with intuitive design and highly useful tools. These first features included a vastly improved search engine, easier-to-read articles, a system for “permalinking” our supplemental digital content and videos, collaborative devices that allow users to mail articles directly to colleagues, enhanced learning tools that enable users to download figures as PowerPoint files, and personalization tools that include the ability for each reader to build his or her own collections of articles, figures, videos, and tables. With the help of Lippincott Williams & Wilkins' Web development teams, PRSJournal.com is continuing to take advantage of and introduce new interactive and interesting Web features to enhance our readers' experiences online. Earlier this year we rolled out our Stand-Alone Video Player exclusively to house our CME video collections. Soon we will be utilizing the player to host true stand-alone videos, starting with a series of lectures and intraoperative videos from the 2010 Baker Gordon Cosmetic Symposium. We hope to bring this series of videos to you each year to provide you with a new multimedia way to improve your understanding of the most cutting edge cosmetic techniques and operations. With our growing video gallery, you will not just be able to read the Journal—you'll be able to watch it, too. Over the summer, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery launched its blog, PRSonally Speaking, which can be found on the home page. We started our blog to share our insights, comments from our esteemed Section Editors, and need-to-know news from the Editorial Office; the blog also enables you to share your thoughts with us. PRSonally Speaking became home to lively, civil debate on hot topics and great discussions pertaining to our field. We encourage you to bookmark us, subscribe to the RSS feed, and join in the ongoing conversation with Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. PRSonally Speaking is an excellent opportunity to have fun, get engaged, and interact with the plastic and reconstructive surgery community. This has always been the community's Journal, but with the blog, the community now provides the opportunity to communicate without submitting an article for print. Also, you may have noticed the new Article as ePUB feature, which launched in July. This is an avant-garde function that allows you to take PRSJournal.com with you in reader-friendly formats for devices, including the Barnes & Noble Nook, Sony eReaders, and the Apple iPad. For readers who want the Journal always at their fingertips without having to carry around any bound volumes, this function will be incredibly useful. In the past year, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery has also started tweeting, so that our readers and “Twitter followers” can have another avenue to keep abreast of the Journal. Follow us at www.twitter.com/prsjournal to obtain information on free content, new additions to the video library, and other Journal news and announcements. Other new features on our Web site that are designed with you in mind include a more robust Publish Ahead of Print selection and our Quick Polls, designed to let you tell us how you feel. Coming soon, PRSJournal will be launching a second release of the LWW Journals Web Platform, giving you access to many more interactive and exciting Web features that will further enhance your Web experience. These features include the Alert Me When Cited function (Fig. 1), which will allow you to sign up for an email alert any time an article of interest is cited by any newer LWW article. In the same vein, two new features will provide a list of LWW articles that cited that article, with links where available, and a ticker that shows the total number of times each articles was cited. These features enable Journal readers to follow their topics of interest beyond PRS; our Journal is part of a larger community, and now, through these citation tools, our readers can follow an article's impact and related topics from journal to journal.Fig. 1.: The Alert Me When Cited function will allow users to sign up for email alerts any time an article of interest is cited by a newer LWW article.Another new feature that will help our readers interact with Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery content in new ways is a tab on the “Most Popular” webpart that shows the Journal's Highest Impact articles. If you enjoy seeing the “most viewed” and “most emailed” articles, then the “highest impact” articles will add a new dimension to your reading of the Journal, allowing you quick access to the Journal's highest impact articles according to the ISI Hot Papers service. Adding additional support to our e-reader presence is a new Journals@LWWiPhone app, which lets readers register and identify their interests, browse Tables of Content, read abstracts, and track their “most viewed articles.” This new app is another example of how PRS content will continue to be offered in new mediums and modes, wherever and however you want to read it. Finally, we will soon be stepping behind the camera with increasing frequency to bring you more videos, including Video Discussions and Introductions by the Editor. With our recent and upcoming Web enhancements, we are taking steps closer to offering our readers the ability to personalize Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery to their own interests. You can already build your own collections of videos, pictures, and more. With the next feature release, you'll be able to track how often your article is cited. Soon you will be able to personalize the PRS experience even further: we will provide the options and you can customize your experience to what you want to read, listen to, watch, collect, and engage. Technology should be in service to the user, not the other way around. We believe these new additions to PRSJournal.com are fully in service of our users. With these changes, we are making the PRSJournal Web site a fully immersive, highly customizable environment that will continue to enhance our readers' experience with PRS content. The days of articles simply being “shoveled” online are long gone; the Journal of record is a vibrant, dynamic, evolving Web site and can be found, as always, at www.PRSJournal.com. If you have any comments or concerns, or any new features or functions you would like to see us implement, please contact us via email, our blog, Twitter … or even a traditional letter to the editor (we still gladly accept those). Our Web site is now anything but dull; let us know how we could be even more exciting. That's what Web 2.0 is all about.

AB  - This article is devoted to the philosophy of science in Russia from the end of the 19 th century to&nbsp;the beginning of the 1920s. In that period, the Philosophical Society was one of the philosophy&nbsp;centers in the country. An important characteristic of the society was its interdisciplinarity. This&nbsp;affected both the list of its members and the topics of the papers presented at its meetings. From&nbsp;the very beginning, the society consisted of representatives of various fields of science, including&nbsp;botanists, physicists, mathematicians, lawyers, psychologists, historians, and philosophers. This&nbsp;enabled a comprehensive review of individual philosophical problems and ideas. With the principle of interdisciplinarity at its root, the Philosophical Society became a platform for fruitful debates over important problems from various disciplines, including philosophy of science. Some of&nbsp;them are summarized in this article.

AB  - <h3></h3> Sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV researchers publish in scholarly journals to disseminate their work. The scholarly publishing industry has transformed beyond recognition in the past 20 years with the advent of the Internet. Not only have methods of dissemination of scholarly work changed, in addition there has been a proliferation of many different aspects of publishing, with innovations in the types of material considered as academic output, changes in peer review, and business models and new opportunities for engagement post publication. At the same time there have been fundamental changes in much of the infrastructure of publishing, including author identity, versioning of articles and linking within and between articles. We are at a critical point in the opening up of access to the literature and what happens next will determine whether it really does become a global, and not just a developed world, public good. Skirmishes around some of these innovations have distracted from this vital debate. It is crucial for the next phase in scholarly publishing that everyone involved – be it authors, reviewers or editors -–&nbsp;engages with this exciting debate to ensure that publishing STI and HIV research serves their needs.

The aim of PLS is to enable a broader audience of experts and non‐experts to understand the original article. Here, we outline the evidence base for the value and impact of PLS and how they can enable diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility in scholarly publishing. PLS can diversify readership and authorship, address information inequity, include typically under‐represented stakeholders and provide an accessible route into scholarly literature.

AB  - Objective – Our article examines the effects of Quebec’s provincial funding agency (FRQ)’s revised 2022 OA policy on researchers. Following FRQ’s participation as a cOAlition S funding agency, which involves endorsing Plan S principles, we provide an overview of the OA options for researchers. We examine these options under the FRQ 2019 and FRQ 2022 policy years, account for the effect of transformative agreements (TA) on OA publishing options, as well as the financial implications for researchers under the revised policy. Methods – The researchers extracted a list of FRQ-funded publications from years 2020 to 2022 using the DOI registration agency Crossref. Using this sample set, the researchers quantitatively analyzed OA options under the previous policy and the revised one, comparing the two. To determine the effect of transformative agreements (TAs)s, we reviewed current agreements offered through Canada’s national licensing agency Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN). Results ­– We found that the self-archiving method for open access (OA) is reduced under the revised 2022 policy. Our results lead us to anticipate the pressure felt by authors who will be required to pay article processing charges (APCs) to meet grant requirements. Conclusion – The current publishing patterns of FRQ-funded researchers are primarily concentrated in hybrid journals not covered by transformative agreements. As such, researchers will face additional financial costs should these publishing patterns continue. Concerted efforts among all stakeholders (researchers, universities, libraries, and funders) are needed to sustainably transition to immediate OA.

Citations are an essential part of scholarly documents, and they are summarized in the references section at the end of the article or book chapter. The problem is that not everything that is cited in a scholarly document ends up in the references list.

Among the Scholarly Kitchen’s many designated “chefs” (i.e., regular writers) are Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe and Roger Schonfeld, both of whom possess a uniquely comprehensive, global perspective spanning the fields of scholarly publishing, scientific research, communication, academic libraries, and higher education. As joint plenary speakers at the 2022 CSE Annual Meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, Hinchliffe and Schonfeld shared their insights and observations about several recent trends and trajectories they’ve identified in the scholarly publishing industry. Hinchliffe began the tandem talk by framing it within the concept of future thinking—the goal of which is not necessarily to predict the future, but rather to engage in strategic dialogue and raise informed, enterprising questions that will serve to sculpt the world in which we eventually live. Doing so, she said, illuminates the policies and strategies that factor into a desirable future, with the caveat that a desirable future for one party may be unappealing to another. In […]

Selected open access (OA) journals are included in the ranking to assess current OA development in support of scholarly communication. It is found that OA journals have gained momentum supporting high-quality research and publication, and some OA journals have been ranked as high as the best traditional print journals. The findings will help convince scholars to make more contributions to OA journal publications, and also encourage librarians and information professionals to make continuous efforts for library publishing.

AB  - This study aimed to clarify the present position of Ultrasonography in the scholarly journal network with a variety of bibliometric indicators. Furthermore, developmental strategies for Ultrasonography to become a top-tier journal are suggested.The following bibliometric indicators were analyzed: number of citable articles, countries of authors, total cites, impact factor, Hirsch index, authors' countries and source titles of citing articles, and the titles of sources cited by articles in Ultrasonography.The annual number of citable articles was consistently 40 from 2014 to 2019. The number of countries of authors increased to 22 in 2018-2019. The numbers of total cites reached 632 in Web of Science, 595 in Scopus, and 552 in the Crossref metadata in 2019. The estimated 2-year impact factor soared from 2.15 in 2016 to 3.20 in 2019. The Hirsch index was 20 in both Scopus and the Web of Science Core Collection. Authors from 76 countries cited Ultrasonography. The number of source titles of citing articles was 668, and the number of source titles cited by articles in Ultrasonography was 1,246.The above bibliometric results show that Ultrasonography has become a top-tier journal in its field. Ultrasonography furnishes an example of how after changing its language policy to English-only, a local society journal became a highly cited journal in a short period of time. For further development of the journal, adoption of a data-sharing policy is recommended. Furthermore, indexation in MEDLINE should be pursued in the near future.

From the perspective of this project, she discusses the challenges for librarians of integrating with other functions to meet the needs of students studying ‘flexibly’. What is the role of the library for an online student who may only know the university as a web site? What will be the expectations of those students, formed by familiarity with commercial applications on the web, and can they be met without lowering academic standards? The article discusses some of the implications—legal, pedagogical, technical—of working in a web environment to deliver learning flexibly.

AB  - The Internet has transformed scholarly publishing, most notably, by the introduction of open access publishing. Recently, there has been a rise of online journals characterized as ‘predatory’, which actively solicit manuscripts and charge publications fees without providing robust peer review and editorial services. We carried out a cross-sectional comparison of characteristics of potential predatory, legitimate open access, and legitimate subscription-based biomedical journals. On July 10, 2014, scholarly journals from each of the following groups were identified – potential predatory journals (source: Beall’s List), presumed legitimate, fully open access journals (source: PubMed Central), and presumed legitimate subscription-based (including hybrid) journals (source: Abridged Index Medicus). MEDLINE journal inclusion criteria were used to screen and identify biomedical journals from within the potential predatory journals group. One hundred journals from each group were randomly selected. Journal characteristics (e.g., website integrity, look and feel, editors and staff, editorial/peer review process, instructions to authors, publication model, copyright and licensing, journal location, and contact) were collected by one assessor and verified by a second. Summary statistics were calculated. Ninety-three predatory journals, 99 open access, and 100 subscription-based journals were analyzed; exclusions were due to website unavailability. Many more predatory journals’ homepages contained spelling errors (61/93, 66%) and distorted or potentially unauthorized images (59/93, 63%) compared to open access journals (6/99, 6% and 5/99, 5%, respectively) and subscription-based journals (3/100, 3% and 1/100, 1%, respectively). Thirty-one (33%) predatory journals promoted a bogus impact metric – the Index Copernicus Value – versus three (3%) open access journals and no subscription-based journals. Nearly three quarters (n = 66, 73%) of predatory journals had editors or editorial board members whose affiliation with the journal was unverified versus two (2%) open access journals and one (1%) subscription-based journal in which this was the case. Predatory journals charge a considerably smaller publication fee (median $100 USD, IQR $63–$150) than open access journals ($1865 USD, IQR $800–$2205) and subscription-based hybrid journals ($3000 USD, IQR $2500–$3000). We identified 13 evidence-based characteristics by which predatory journals may potentially be distinguished from presumed legitimate journals. These may be useful for authors who are assessing journals for possible submission or for others, such as universities evaluating candidates’ publications as part of the hiring process.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the practices of Pakistani academic researchers with respect to using, citing, and publishing their scholarly work. The quantitative survey method adopted to collect data from local researchers was based on an instrument developed and used by CIBER. Their notions and practices involved in deciding trust and quality of scholarly journals were obtained. The findings revealed that national and institutional policies have significantly influenced their decisions regarding the publishing outlets. The credibility of indexing services was found to be an important factor in choosing the journal for publishing research. ISI Web of Science Impact Factor was not considered as the top source for determining quality and trustworthiness. This study is the first of its kind that targets the top two universities of the country. A comparison of the findings with another international study shows that some of the behavioural traits are compatible with scholars from less-developed countries like India and China, while others are more similar to the ones from highly developed countries like USA and UK.

AB  - ABSTRACT The transition from traditional, paper‐based publishing to electronic publishing presents many challenges for publishers and their constituents. Among the most significant are those that concern linking to articles that are available online and citing of articles that are now published online prior to (or even in lieu of) the final pagination and binding of paper issues. The solutions to these problems will have a great impact on the usability of the scholarly electronic corpus for the research community. In particular, the solutions must be easy to use, persistent, and scalable. Here we examine some pragmatic solutions (in use now) that satisfy these criteria and contrast them with other proposed solutions. The examples are drawn mainly from the experiences of the American Physical Society, but the lessons gleaned will have wide applicability.

AB  - The rise of predatory journals and the dubious methods they use to attract researchers to publish in them and serve on their editorial boards is disrupting the scholarly publishing landscape. It is increasingly difficult to distinguish between legitimate and predatory articles and journals. Two views of this challenging landscape were presented during NASIG’s 34th Annual Conference. Marydee Ojala, a former academic/corporate librarian and currently editor of a magazine for librarians, outlined dangers such as pirated versions of scholarly articles and concerns that the inclusion of inaccurate and incoherent “sting” articles in Open Access journals has soured the general public’s attitude towards scientific expertise. In a “fake news” world, debasing scholarly research is a potent threat to academic disciplines and to libraries. Regina Reynolds, the head of the U.S ISSN Center, recounted the experiences of ISSN staff on the front lines of dealing with the full range of new publishers and explored the broader questions raised by the predatory publishing phenomenon. Libraries, academia, traditional publishers, and others need to continue grappling with their roles and responsibilities regarding this new reality.

AB  - SUMMARY Open access publishing has a dark side, the predatory publishers and journals that exist for revenue rather than scholarly activity. This article helps researchers to: (1) identify some of the commonly used tactics and characteristics of predatory publishing; and (2) avoid falling prey to them. In summary, authors should choose the journal for submission themselves and never respond to unsolicited emails. It is also important to check blacklists such as ‘Stop Predatory Journals’ and whitelists such the Directory of Open Access Journals. LEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this article, readers should be able to do the following: • be aware of the dangers of predatory journals and publishers • use blacklists of predatory journals and publishers’ whitelists of legitimate open access journals • be aware of warning signs that might suggest a predatory journal or publisher. DECLARATION OF INTEREST S.K. is on the editorial board of BJPsych International . He also receives five to ten spam emails a day from predatory journals and publishers.

AB  - Abstract Predatory journals are a blemish on scholarly publishing and academia and the studies published within them are more likely to contain data that is false. The inclusion of studies from predatory journals in evidence syntheses is potentially problematic due to this propensity for false data to be included. To date, there has been little exploration of the opinions and experiences of evidence synthesisers when dealing with predatory journals in the conduct of their evidence synthesis. In this paper, the thoughts, opinions, and attitudes of evidence synthesisers towards predatory journals and the inclusion of studies published within these journals in evidence syntheses were sought. Focus groups were held with participants who were experienced evidence synthesisers from JBI (previously the Joanna Briggs Institute) collaboration. Utilising qualitative content analysis, two generic categories were identified: predatory journals within evidence synthesis, and predatory journals within academia. Our findings suggest that evidence synthesisers believe predatory journals are hard to identify and that there is no current consensus on the management of these studies if they have been included in an evidence synthesis. There is a critical need for further research, education, guidance, and development of clear processes to assist evidence synthesisers in the management of studies from predatory journals.

AB  - Nowadays the world of scholarly publishing is in serious trouble because of the increasing number of predatory publishing. Besides, citation of articles from predatory journals is also unethical that undermines the quality of research papers. Because of ignorance of predatory publishing and/or compulsion of getting published in a limited time, scholars from Universities and young researchers become victim to predatory or hijacked journals. The purpose of this paper is to create awareness among authors, especially novice ones, about predatory publication. Research institutions should encourage their researchers to publish their articles in valuable journals indexed in Web of Science's Journal Citation Reports (JCR), Clarivate Analytics, formerly part of Thomson-Reuters) or other famous scientific databases such as Scopus, PubMed and MEDLINE. In this way, attention to the Thomson Reuters’ Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and Journal Ranking (JRK) and Scopus grade (Q1, Q2 and Q3) may be useful and necessary.

AB  - AbstractThe escalation in open-access publishing has fueled the rise of questionable businesses, namely, ‘predatory’ journals. Predatory journals and their publishers seek manuscripts through aggressive electronic solicitation and execute flawed peer-review practices, consequently undermining the scholarly record and current research cultures, globally. As these journals are not indexed in any legitimate databases, the research they publish is often undiscoverable and fails to be disseminated to a worldwide readership. Acknowledging this threat to the credibility of science, this article aims to alert researchers at various levels of their career of the increasing global issue of predatory journals, and offer helpful advice and resources for identifying and avoiding them.

AB  - A negative consequence of the rapid growth of scholarly open access publishing funded by article processing charges is the emergence of publishers and journals with highly questionable marketing and peer review practices. These so-called predatory publishers are causing unfounded negative publicity for open access publishing in general. Reports about this branch of e-business have so far mainly concentrated on exposing lacking peer review and scandals involving publishers and journals. There is a lack of comprehensive studies about several aspects of this phenomenon, including extent and regional distribution. After an initial scan of all predatory publishers and journals included in the so-called Beall’s list, a sample of 613 journals was constructed using a stratified sampling method from the total of over 11,000 journals identified. Information about the subject field, country of publisher, article processing charge and article volumes published between 2010 and 2014 were manually collected from the journal websites. For a subset of journals, individual articles were sampled in order to study the country affiliation of authors and the publication delays. Over the studied period, predatory journals have rapidly increased their publication volumes from 53,000 in 2010 to an estimated 420,000 articles in 2014, published by around 8,000 active journals. Early on, publishers with more than 100 journals dominated the market, but since 2012 publishers in the 10–99 journal size category have captured the largest market share. The regional distribution of both the publisher’s country and authorship is highly skewed, in particular Asia and Africa contributed three quarters of authors. Authors paid an average article processing charge of 178 USD per article for articles typically published within 2 to 3 months of submission. Despite a total number of journals and publishing volumes comparable to respectable (indexed by the Directory of Open Access Journals) open access journals, the problem of predatory open access seems highly contained to just a few countries, where the academic evaluation practices strongly favor international publication, but without further quality checks.

AB  - Predatory journals pose a global threat to science. Young scientists and scholars are easy victims of the predatory publications. Predatory publications reduce the accuracy, reliability, and validity of the scientific works published. The predatory publications are worthless, just a waste of time, resources, money, and efforts. Predatory publications undermine the value of legitimate publications. In order to discourage predatory publications, educational and research institutions should set the rules for publication in the journals that must be indexed in web of science, Journal Citation Reports (JCR, Clarivate Analytics, formerly Thomson-Reuters) or other famous scientific databases such as Scopus, DOAJ, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Citation of articles from predatory journals should be discouraged. The students, academics, and researchers should be careful to avoid predatory publications to maintain their credentials.

AB  - Open access publishing enables scholarship to be openly accessible to everyone, which has countless benefits. However, the open access movement has opened the door for “predatory publishers” to take advantage of researchers surviving in this publish or perish academic landscape. Predatory journals are becoming increasingly common. Nursing researchers, instructors, and students need to be made aware of the dangers of predatory journals, and they need to know how to identify them. While there are blacklists and whitelists that can be used to aid in decision-making, it is critical to note that these lists can never be entirely up to date. This article incorporates a literature review which provides insights into newer trends in predatory and unethical publishing, including “journal hijacking” and “bogus impact factors”. Extensive criteria for assessing emerging or unknown journals is compiled to aid researchers, students, educators, and the public in evaluating open access publications.

AB  - Introduction The advent of open access publishing has allowed for unrestricted and rapid knowledge dissemination and can generate higher citation levels. However, the establishment of predatory journals exploits this model and may lead to publication of non-peer reviewed work. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the characteristics and trends of indexed publications in paediatric urology. The primary outcomes were to compare open access vs non-open access publishing. The secondary outcome was to assess whether any open access publications in this cohort could be classified as predatory based on journal data basing and external peer review policies. Methods PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase reviews were carried out for any publication using the terms ‘p(a)ediatric urology’ over a 5-year period (October 2012–2017). These publications were individually accessed, assessed for relevance and cross-checked using the ISI Web of Knowledge Journal Citation Report. Bibliometric data, journal type and access model were all individually assessed, ranked and compared using descriptive and non-parametric statistical methods. Results From an initial total of 4075 indexed publications, 2244 journal publications across 51 countries were included based on relevance, of which 611 were open access. Open access journals were significantly more likely to publish basic science/laboratory versus clinical publications (10.9% vs 3.3%). They were more likely have higher average citations/publication (17 vs. 8), but there was no difference between open and closed journal impact factors (3.1 vs. 2.7). The overall rate of open access, indexed publications that were not peer reviewed and/or included in open access databases was 6.5% Discussion The overall numbers of paediatric urological articles appearing on PubMed between 2012 and 2017 have increased by approximately 75%, while the number of open access articles has remained relatively static (25%). Researchers may prefer to publish in specific journals to disseminate results to a particular audience or fear in the current climate that an open access journal may not be considered legitimate, and possibly even predatory, thus having a negative impact on the data and the author's reputation. The impact factor status and route/method of publication may be less important.

AB  - Predatory publishing is currently a critical problem for researchers, particularly with the continuous rise of online journals and the increasing challenge of distinguishing between journals that can be trusted and those which should be avoided. This article begins by providing an overview of predatory publishing, focusing specifically on its definition and impacts and the prevailing predatory practices current in scientific publications. Next, the article discusses how researchers can avoid publishing with predatory publishers. We recommend that researchers do not rely solely on watchlists, rather that they develop their own skills to enable them to detect predatory practices. Finally, the article provides some practical recommendations and resources for researchers to use to assess journals as publishing venues.

AB  - Open-access is a model for publishing scholarly, peer-reviewed journals on the Internet that relies on sources of funding other than subscription fees. Some publishers and editors have exploited the author-pays model of open-access, publishing for their own profit. Submissions are encouraged through widely distributed e-mails on behalf of a growing number of journals that may accept many or all submissions and subject them to little, if any, peer review or editorial oversight. Bogus conference invitations are distributed in a similar fashion. The results of these less than ethical practices might include loss of faculty member time and money, inappropriate article inclusions in curriculum vitae, and costs to the college or funding source.

AB  - Introduction: Research data management (RDM) is being recognized as an increasingly important role for librarians. In this paper, the role of health science librarians in supporting research data management endeavors is examined.&#x0D; Methods: All job postings currently (as of April 5th, 2018) available on the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information (iSchool) job site were analyzed to identify positions related to health science librarianship. The job responsibilities and descriptions were then examined to identify instances where research data management was mentioned.&#x0D; Results: Thirty-two postings from the search results were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Of these thirty-two health science librarian postings which were included in the analysis, eight included supporting research data management services, in some capacity, as part of the position description.&#x0D; Discussion/ Conclusion: Through the job posting analysis, a picture emerges where RDM is not consistently seen as a role for health science librarians. However, the literature indicates that in many instances, research data management is already being done by health science librarians, and is a trend which is likely to continue in the future. As such, it is important that research data management services start being acknowledged and reflected in education and job description opportunities.

AB  - Preregistration and registered reports are two promising open science practices for increasing transparency in the scientific process. In particular, they create transparency around one of the most consequential distinctions in research design: the data analytics decisions made before data collection and post-hoc decisions made afterwards. Preregistration involves publishing a time-stamped record of a study design before data collection or analysis. Registered reports are a publishing approach that facilitates the evaluation of research without regard for the direction or magnitude of findings. In this article, I evaluate opportunities and challenges for these open science methods, offer initial guidelines for their use, explore relevant tensions around new practices, and illustrate examples from educational psychology and social science.

AB  - Open science is an ever-evolving phenomenon. Open science deals with the availability of data and publications, which includes an open approach with which publicly funded research is sought to be made available to all members of society and the public. It is an umbrella term that includes a multitude of assumptions about the future of knowledge creation and dissemination (Fecher &amp; Friesike, 2014). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) emphasizes libraries as a key player and fundamental drivers of open science because they have adapted their role to today’s age and are now active in preserving, publishing, and disseminating digital scientific material in the form of publications, data, and other research-relate content. During their studies, LIS (Library and information science(s)) students acquire knowledge and develop a set of skills that will prepare them for work in today’s information environment. In 2020. LIBER’s (Ligue des Bibliothèques Européennes de Recherche – Association of European Research Libraries) Digital Skills for Library Staff and Researchers Working Group published a visual presentation of the necessary competencies for librarians and researchers. Information science studies, including those in Croatia, are exposed to constant changes in the field, including the development of open science. For this reason, it is necessary to constantly think about the adaptation of study programs through which students will acquire basic knowledge related to the promotion and advocacy of open science. The term “open science”, and everything it encompasses, should be an integral part of study programs in the field of information sciences. The aim of this paper is to explore the representation of skills and competencies for open science in study programs at the LIS studies in Croatia: Department of Information and Communication Sciences (Zagreb), Department of information sciences (Osijek) and Department of information science (Zadar). This research indicated the need for greater inclusion of the concepts of scientific communication and open science in the learning outcomes at the level of programs in the study of information sciences in Zadar, Zagreb, and Osijek.

AB  - L ibrary publishing programs have the potential to be a critical component of the community-controlled infrastructure pushing the scholarly publishing landscape toward more open and equitable practices. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that long-term preservation is particularly problematic for open access publications, 1 and the products of library publishing programs are unfortunately not immune. While preservation is a significant challenge for small publishing programs generally, in many ways library publishers are in a better position to meet it than their non-library-affiliated peers. Libraries have long been centers for preservation and have invested in individuals, tools, and partnerships that are at the forefront of the preservation effort. Yet the expertise available in libraries often seems disconnected from the library publishing practitioners who could benefit from it.

AB  - In 2012, Harvard University said it could no longer afford the high cost of academic journal subscriptions. The aim of this paper is to discuss the pressures, opportunities and costs facing research library acquisitions budgets in Australia. It seeks to understand how libraries are coping with resource issues and what strategies they are deploying to overcome their fiscal challenges. The findings are presented of a study into the pressures, opportunities, and costs facing research library budgets in Australia. A qualitative research methodology was used to undertake the study. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with representatives involved at the highest level of library resource allocation from their respective universities. The study provides discussion on how libraries are coping with resource issues and what strategies they are deploying to overcome their fiscal challenges.

AB  - Relatively little has been said about the opportunities and challenges of digital, open access publishing as it pertains to postgraduate-led journals catering to postgraduate researchers.This paper draws on the authors’ experiences with Postgraduate English,&amp;nbsp;one of the longest-running, born-digital journals for postgraduate researchers in English studies. It makes the case for the benefit of such publications within the prestige economy and describes the ways in which quality can be assured, challenging those who might see postgraduate publications as further diluting the pool of high-quality research. At the same time, the paper raises critical questions about who really wins in postgraduate publishing. While those who publish and edit can benefit from the prestige indication of these activities, ultimately host institutions may gain more from the relationship via the hidden labour costs behind such activity.

AB  - ABSTRACT The article processing charge (APC) is currently the primary method of funding professionally published open access (OA) peer‐reviewed journals. The pricing principles of 77 OA publishers publishing over 1,000 journals using APCs were studied and classified. The most commonly used pricing method is a single fixed fee, which can either be the same for all of a publisher's journals or individually determined for each journal. Fees are usually only levied for publication of accepted papers, but there are some journals that also charge submission fees. Instead of fixed prices, many publishers charge by the page or have multi‐tiered fees depending on the length of articles. The country of origin of the author can also influence the pricing, in order to facilitate publishing for authors from developing countries.

AB  - Recent reports on Australia's research infrastructure have highlighted the decline in serial subscriptions in academic and research libraries during the 1990s. They have used the annual CAUL statistics in order to support these claims. This article examines the CAUL statistics for serial subscriptions, indicating their numerous flaws when used for longitudinal analysis. Alternative interpretations of the statistics are given, which provide some evidence that rates of subscriptions to print periodicals were sustained for a longer period than previous uses of the data have suggested.

C1  - Plant Ecology, Bayreuth Center of Ecology and Environmental Research (BayCEER), University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany
AB  - With this Forum contribution I wish to shed light on the problematic developments in scientific publishing resulting from the strong push of science funders towards gold open access (OA). This has given rise to numerous “predatory” journals, that maximise profit at the expense of scientific quality. With a bibliometric analysis in the field of ecology I demonstrate that over the period 2014–2022 the publication numbers in “predatory” OA journals have grown exponentially (+44% annually), while in all other journal types, article numbers were stagnating or even decreasing since a few years. Then I highlight how different OA publication models from society-owned journals to publisher-owned “predatory” journals, differ in the prices authors pay and how the income is split between effective costs, pure profit and money transferred back to science. To help with the recognition of the different journal types, I provide a list journals in the fields of ecology and organismal botany that are owned by academic societies, as well as a list of criteria to recognize “predatory” journals. Authors, reviewers and editors should consider carefully where they submit papers or provide volunteer service. My suggestion is to prioritize society-owned journals, while avoiding cooperation with “predatory” journals. Science funders and libraries have played a major role in the negative developments reviewed in this paper, but at the same time they have the capacity to change the course, mainly by two steps: In the short term they should link the payment of article processing charges (APCs) to strict quality criteria, while in the medium term, they should overcome the gold OA system towards a diamond OA system that would avoid the inflation of low-quality publications and remove barriers not only from readers, but also from authors, while at the same time likely reducing the overall costs.

AB  - Though online journals provide a convenient way to locate a desired article, they have not yet been firmly established in the scholarly communication system. The major reason is the uncertainty of pricing schemes. We must look beyond the phenomenon of flourishing online journals to recognize the crisis in scholarly communications which has been brought about mainly by highly priced journals and we must understand the entirety of this very complicated situation. “Aggregators” “Consortia” and “SPARC by ARL” are discussed as possible means for achieving a breakthrough in the problem.

AB  - Despite continued attention, finding adequate criteria for distinguishing "good" from "bad" scholarly journals remains an elusive goal. In this essay, I propose a solution informed by the work of Imre Lakatos and his methodology of scientific research programmes (MSRP). I begin by reviewing several notable attempts at appraising journal quality - focusing primarily on the impact factor and development of journal blacklists and whitelists. In doing so, I note their limitations and link their overarching goals to those found within the philosophy of science. I argue that Lakatos's MSRP and specifically his classifications of "progressive" and "degenerative" research programmes can be analogized and repurposed for the evaluation of scholarly journals. I argue that this alternative framework resolves some of the limitations discussed above and offers a more considered evaluation of journal quality - one that helps account for the historical evolution of journal-level publication practices and attendant contributions to the growth (or stunting) of scholarly knowledge. By doing so, the seeming problem of journal demarcation is diminished. In the process I utilize two novel tools (the mistake index and scite index) to further illustrate and operationalize aspects of the MSRP.

AB  - Essay writing has always been an important skill for students. However, this skill could be more comfortable for them. Therefore, an effective technique is needed to help students to cope with the problem. Project-based learning (PjBL)is one of the learning models which can make learners interested and motivated in writing. The study employs expose-facto with mixed data types. This research investigated 23 English students’ activities, results, and their responses in essay writing using a PjBL model. We employed three instruments; observation, questionnaire, and test. Qualitative descriptive techniques analyzed the data. The results showed that (1) the implementation of the project-based learning model was classified as good and successful. It can be seen from the student's learning outcomes and the successful implementation of the steps that have been determined. (2) The students’ responses to the project-based learning model have been classified as positive since the students explained effective ways of learning essay writing. The students’ learning outcomes show better achievements in learning essay writing. Thus, learning essay writing can be concluded. It implies that implementing the PjBL model in ELT students yields good vibes in students’ learning activities.

AB  - ABSTRACT In spring 1997, a questionnaire was mailed to 95 major academic libraries in the United States to explore how serials librarians are responding to the boom of electronic journals (e‐journals). Fifty librarians (52.6%) answered the survey with one follow‐up. The study found that over 70% of the libraries that returned the survey had participated in e‐journal‐related activities. Questions relating to ‘access’ were consistently ranked high in explaining why librarians in major academic libraries think e‐journals are valuable, yet ‘cost’ seems to be a critical factor in determining e‐journal adoption. For most of the libraries surveyed, the figure for e‐journals appears modest, although some institutions claimed to have more than 1,100 titles in their e‐journal collections.

AB  - Open access (OA) has become a critical issue in science policy and affects a wide range of activities in universities and research labs. Research-performing organizations (RPOs), defined as publicly funded universities and research institutions, face significant challenges in shaping the OA transformation. This article examines the spheres of activity available to RPOs for shaping the OA transformation, using a categorization of 22 spheres of activity related to OA. These spheres of activity include strategy and communication, services and infrastructures, business relationships with publishers, and collaborations. Current challenges and future action areas in promoting OA are also described, providing support for RPOs in handling OA and highlighting key issues. The categorization can serve as a tool for systematically assessing OA activities at RPOs and shows that OA is a cross-cutting issue in these organizations. Collaboration on OA activities, both within and beyond organizations, presents a challenge. To effectively promote OA, it is crucial to strengthen the interaction between funding agencies and RPOs. Libraries are critical stakeholders, playing a vital role in advancing OA at the local, national, and international levels in partnership with RPO management and other partners in faculty, administration, and information technology.

C1  - W.A.C. Bennett Library, Simon Fraser University
AB  - Scholarly data, such as academic articles, research reports and theses/dissertations, traditionally have limited dissemination in that they generally require journal subscription or affiliation with particular libraries. The notion of open access, made possible by rapidly advancing digital technologies, aims to break the limitations that hinder academic developments and information exchange. This paper presents the Electronic Thesis &amp; Dissertation (ETD) Project at the Simon Fraser University Library, British Columbia, Canada, and discusses various technological considerations associated with the Project including selection of software, capture of metadata, and long-term preservation of the digitized data. The paper concludes that a well-established project plan that takes into account not only technological issues but also issues relating to project policies, procedures, and copyright permissions that occur in the process of providing open access plays a vital role for the overall success of such projects.

AB  - Knowledge, as a prerequisite for development, is contingent on information. The main value of information is in its ability to be used, reused, and shared. Open access (OA) allows for the easy dissemination and preservation of information by providing all scholarly communication and knowledge at no cost to the end user. In the rapidly expanding, global knowledge-based economy, Africa’s steady progress from the peripheral to the epicenter of knowledge production is not to be ignored, not least because of its reliance on OA. Such access environments and institutional repositories throughout the continent are playing significant roles in maximizing the impact of research output. This paper reveals that OA content is more citable, not simply because of the quality of the output, but instead of the advantage that OA brings in maximizing accessibility and increased citation. It goes on to show that OA will enhance the research community’s existing system for evaluating and rewarding research productivity. Ultimately, OA has the ability to elevate (South) Africa, its universities and institutions, to the status of knowledge producers rather than mere knowledge consumers.

AB  - In this article, we provide a toolbox of recommendations and resources for those aspiring to promote the uptake of open scientific practices. Open Science encompasses a range of behaviours that aim to improve the transparency of scientific research. This paper is divided into seven sections, each devoted to different groups or institutions in the research ecosystem: colleagues, students, departments and faculties, universities, academic libraries, journals, and funders. We describe the behavioural influences and incentives for each of these stakeholders as well as changes they can make to foster Open Science. Our primary goal, however, is to suggest actions that researchers can take to promote these behaviours, inspired by simple principles of behaviour change: make it easy, social, and attractive. In isolation, a small shift in one person’s behaviour may appear to make little difference, but when combined, many shifts can radically alter shared norms and culture. We offer this toolbox to assist individuals and institutions in cultivating a more open research culture.

AB  - We are now in an age when the development and sustainability of our society depend critically on research and innovation. At the same time, we are facing the rapid growth of digital knowledge, ubiquitous internet, and open innovation in diverse fields. Open access to scientific knowledge can take the full advantages of the digital and internet revolution, and ensure effective implementation of strategies of innovation-driven development. AsPremierLiKeqiang emphasized at the 2014AnnualMeeting of the Global Research Council held in Beijing on 27 May 2014, ‘Science is the driving force for development, and scientific knowledge should be available to all. Amore open platform will enable everyone to share scientific knowledge, and this will contribute to the inclusive development that benefits all’. China’s R&D thrives on knowledge obtained around the world. As China is advancing towards a top-tier position in the world’s research output, open access will improve the verifiability, reproducibility, and impact of research itself. It will also create a stronger base for effective research collaboration, especially in projects that aim to meet interdisciplinary, translational, and strategic challenges. More importantly, open access provides a new public knowledge base that enables generation of new knowledge through data mining, supporting innovative research on all fronts. With open access, knowledge is no longer confined within the library collections or databases accessible to the privileged few, thus becomingpowerful innovative instruments for all.This is especially true for China. According to theChinese Statistics Yearbook for Science and Technology 2013, there are more than 3600 R&D institutions, 47 000 R&D-active enterprises, and 200 high-tech industrial development zones. Adding to this, there are 610million internet users by the end of 2013. Imagine the possibilities when all internet users have easy access to and can play with all scientific knowledge over the network! Open access helps us to liberate knowledge from labs, journals, and libraries into anopen knowledge laboratory for all, tomobilize innovation capabilities, to enable big data-driven research, and to stimulate user-driven and market-oriented innovation, thus ensuring the greatest return on investment for publicly funded research. Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has been promoting open access to knowledge all the time. In May of 2014, CAS issued its open access policy, requiring allCAS researchers todeposit their peer-reviewed research articles resulting fromall public funding into their respective institutional repositories (IRs), and to provide public access within 12 months of publication. More than 100 CAS institutes now have their IRs, with more than 440 thousand full-text research papers deposited and 6.9 million downloads registered in 2013 alone, making the CAS IR system one of the largest in the world. This is further facilitated by the CAS support to authors publishing in open access journals. And, there are more than 170 open access journals published by CAS, among 600 such journals in China, according to Chinese Science and Technology Association. Chinese scientific communities are working together for open access. TheMinistry of Science and Technology (MoST) has launched its Scientific Reports Public Sharing Systemwhere MoST-funded projects are required to deposit their final reports with open access. Through its National Science and TechnologyLibrary system,MoSTalso supportsChina’s participation in the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics, through which about half of the research papers in high energy physics are now open access immediately after publication. In May of 2014, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) also issued its open access policy requiring open access deposit of research articles resulting from its funding. This is just the beginning.More steps are required inChina to ensure effective, affordable, and sustainable open access. One is to develop operational means for enforceable implementation of the open access deposit requirements of CAS, NSFC, and the like. Another is to develop economical mechanisms for supporting open access publishingwhich is becoming amainstream in scholarly publishing. What is important here is to work with all stakeholders, to foster cooperation among government agencies, publishers, and scientific communities. Given the increasing pace of open access, we can envision an erawhenessentially all published research articles and a substantial portion of research data are open to all. We scientists need to prepare ourselves for this new era, and funding agencies and research institutions need to incorporate open access into their current management and future plan for knowledge infrastructure and research workflow. I trust that open access will lead to new approaches in research and innovation, and will open new horizons in science, technology, and social development.

AB  - Peer review is under pressure. Without fair, transparent and efficient peer review we cannot ensure the right proposals get funded and the correct manuscripts get published. In the era of Open Access, which is driving an exponential increase in the number of submitted publications, how we carry out peer review is becoming increasingly important and how we find reviewers is coming under scrutiny. The current methods are slow and produce bias pools of reviewers. As such we need an improved way. At Prophy we have developed a state-of-the-art referee finder that can find experts to review any manuscript from any scientific field in seconds. Then through post-processing filters we can find appropriate candidate referees who are most likely to review a paper, whilst highlighting important conflicts of interest through our complex citation networks. These methods can ensure fair and independent experts who can review interdisciplinary papers from any discipline. These methods are being delivered through APIs and the editorial workflow of editors ensure the right people get access to these tools. Finally, as large-language models improve, so does Prophy and as such we will be looking to drive real innovation in this area in years to come.

IS  - 1
VL  - 15
AU  - Popowich, Sam
C1  - University of Alberta
AB  - Academic libraries have recently seen a shift from self-management of user-authentication of licensed resources themselves, to cloud-based implementations of "federated identity" technologies. Such technologies aim to solve the problems of fragile access to licensed resources while also better protecting publishers' intellectual property. However, federated identity systems raise a host of issues regarding privacy, surveillance, machinic subjection, and algorithmic governance. This paper traces the development of federated identity systems out of earlier authentication processes, shows how such systems use artificial intelligence techniques to create a trackable "data body" for each student, and then analyzes this whole procedure through the critical theories of Maurizio Lazzarato and Bernard Stiegler. In conclusion, the article argues that the emergent nature of the "data body" creates ambiguity between the hyper-control of contemporary technologies and the possibility of resisting them.

AB  - It has been said that the work of publishers and librarians will merge over time until we are all publarians and lublishers. Do we still envision a shared future? As new publishing programs within libraries and experimental publisher-library collaborations continue to challenge us to move outside of our comfort zones, are we learning from each other? What are some practical, down-to-earth ways that we can take advantage of each other’s expertise? How can we produce and market scholarly content in a more integrated way to meet the needs of scholars in a digital-information ecosystem, without duplicating effort on separate tracks? How might we address sustainability through combined, hybrid business models? In this session, some experienced experimenters and role benders in the world of the humanities will share lessons learned and attempt to chart a way forward to a shared future.

AB  - The 2013 memorandum, ‘Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research’, issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), was a highly significant milestone in expanding public access to the peer-reviewed articles resulting from federally funded research and to the data on which those articles were based. While OSTP drew on a variety of inputs in developing their requirements, the report from the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable was particularly influential. Established in June 2009, at the request of the House Committee on Science and Technology, the Roundtable included a small group of librarians, publishers, university provosts and information science researchers representing a broad range of experiences and perspectives. The recommendations in the Roundtable's January 2010 report were incorporated into the Reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act, which provided legislative direction and support for the OSTP Memorandum. While much of the rhetoric and debate surrounding open access has been heated and hyperbolic, the Roundtable was a uniquely successful effort to bridge ideological divides and develop recommendations to inform federal policy. Imagine, then, the scene at the Capitol Lounge, a favourite watering hole for Congressional and White House staff. ‘We've got to do something! My boss is getting hammered by both sides and he's getting fed up’. There's that bill that the librarians are pushing. Sounds pretty noble. But the guy from AAP says it'll kill their business. Is he right? I don't know anything about publishing, and I have to take anything the lobbyists tell me with several grains of salt. I just want somebody with real expertise to give me some advice without me feeling like I'm being pitched all the time! She looks into her glass. ‘Our #2 says she knows one of the guys coming to the meeting this week. A physicist. Worked on big DOE projects for years, but runs a publishing outfit now. She thinks the boss'll be willing to sponsor a staff committee – a roundtable’. He looks at her quizzically. ‘Get a small group of outside experts to hash out a consensus. But you've got to get the right mix of people so that it doesn't turn into just more lobbying. And it's got to be a little under the radar so they can get something done. She thinks this guy might be the one to organize it. If he's willing’. ‘It's worth a shot. Let me know. I'll keep OSTP in the loop’. How did it come to such a pass, that stakeholders of the scholarly community who had worked hand in hand for decades were now attacking each other for undermining the very basis of scientific communication? The authors of this article had the opportunity to play a key role in the development of public access policies in the United States through their participation in the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable. Here we describe the Roundtable's genesis and impact. Supporters of open access had been building momentum since the mid-1990s. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), as the primary advocacy organization, developed a strategy that would force open access through legislation, fuelled by a rhetorical approach that cast publishers as enemies of science, corruptly locking up research in pursuit of profit. Librarians, already buffeted by increasing subscription prices in a time of tightening university budgets, saw this legislative campaign as an opportunity to weaken the publishers' market power in the course of expanding free access to taxpayer-funded research. In 2000, a petition by the Public Library of Science (PLoS) sought to pressure publishers into immediately adopting an open access model regardless of the financial consequences. By early 2004 OA advocates were working with the NIH (as well as with universities and other funding agencies) to develop policies requiring that articles from grant-funded research be made open. These early campaigns treated all science publishers as a monolithic adversary, despite wide variations in business models and practices. Certainly, the pricing policies of the larger commercial publishers seemed to reflect a captive market in which their journal prices increasingly exceeded their publication costs. The substantial profit margins of the largest made them acutely vulnerable to charges of unfair exploitation. Society publishers, whose margins and subscription rates were generally modest, had seen themselves as fierce defenders of science, but they also viewed an immediate shift to OA as an existential threat. They pushed back. The DC Principles Coalition, comprising 73 non-profit publishers with nearly 400 journals, was formed in 2004 to counter the lobbying by SPARC and its allies (Internet Archive, 2008). The perceived magnitude of the threat was shared by all publishers, and the societies were soon joined by the Association of American Publishers (AAP), principally through their Professional and Scholarly Publishing division, which brought the major commercial publishers with their substantial lobbying muscle to the table. If there had ever been a possibility for the OA advocates and the publishers to work together to develop new economic models, it was quickly lost amid the acrimony. The Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA), was introduced in 2006. FRPAA's backers hoped to legislate something similar to the NIH policy for all federally funded research. In response, the AAP arranged to have the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act introduced. This bill was intended to eviscerate the NIH policy and prevent any similar policies in the future. By 2008, the landscape had devolved to an aggressive, adversarial legislative battle between two warring factions: on one side were open access partisans, who framed their objectives in moral terms, dismissing the fundamental economic issues involved in the major industry shift they were demanding. Publishers, with a group of highly profitable commercial journal publishers now in the lead, believed OA represented a potentially lethal blow to their business model and sought to prevent any government-mandated free access. It was in this climate of inflammatory rhetoric and mutual condemnation that the plan for the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable emerged through a number of meetings and conversations in the spring of 2009. On 29 January, a public symposium entitled ‘Author Deposit Mandates for Federal Research Grantees’ was held under the auspices of the National Research Council's newly formed Board on Research Data and Information (BRDI). ‘The symposium was chaired by the BRDI Chair, Michael Lesk and the representatives of the following organizations made presentations and participated in the discussion: American Physiological Society, American Institute of Physics, American Psychological Association, Society for Science and the Public and publisher of Science News, Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) and National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC) (National Academies, n.d.).’ The intent of the symposium was to further discussion about the issues involved in extending something like the NIH Public Access Policy to other federal funding agencies, but the participants rolled out all the familiar arguments and no progress was made. This led at least some of the participants to begin to investigate alternatives for exploring the issues. These discussions led to a meeting on February 10 with Rep. Bart Gordon (D-TN), then Chair of the House Committee on Science and Technology. At this meeting, facilitated by Dr. Dahlia Sokolov, Staff Director for the Subcommittee on Research and Science Education, Gordon agreed to sponsor the Roundtable. Attending were lobbyist Tony Podesta (on behalf of Reed Elsevier), Eric Massant and Steve Manza from Reed Elsevier and Fred Dylla, Executive Director of the American Institute of Physics (AIP). Sokolov and Dylla knew each other from her time as an AIP Fellow several years earlier and had been in conversation about finding a productive way forward. At the conclusion of the meeting, Dylla was tasked with drafting a charge for the Roundtable and developing a list of potential participants. Dylla emphasized the importance of outreach to and buy-in from the research university community. At about this time, a joint statement calling for universities to ensure the broadest possible access to their work was issued by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), the Association of American Universities (AAU), the Coalition for Networked Information and NASULGC. This document, The University's Role in the Dissemination of Research and Scholarship—A Call to Action (ARL, 2009), outlined a set of principles and recommendations that were very much in keeping with the spirit of the Roundtable concept. Dylla was able to persuade John Vaughn, Executive Vice President of AAU and one of the authors of the document, to chair the Roundtable. When finally assembled, the group was a very carefully balanced mix: Three university provosts, three librarians (one of whom had been a provost), executives of four publishing companies—large, small, commercial, not-for-profit—and three scholarly communication researchers (see the end of the article for names and affiliations). On 19 June, the group met with members of the House Committee on Science and Technology and their staff. According to the official invitation from Sokolov, Committee Chair Gordon had ‘promised the scholarly publishers that he would host an off-the-record roundtable to try to get past the old arguments and facilitate a way forward in terms of federal policy for our funding agencies’. Sokolov went on to say ‘[t]he White House Office of Science and Technology Policy itself is in the early stages of thinking about an overarching federal policy, and they will be participating in this roundtable as well’ (Sokolov, personal communication, 2 June 2009). The evening before the meeting most of the group gathered for dinner in a private room at the Tabard Inn. Everyone in the group knew somebody, but no one knew everybody. Dylla and Vaughn believed that this dinner, and the ones that preceded each of the roundtable's subsequent meetings, were critical to the group's success. They deliberately sought people whose opinions and backgrounds covered a wide spectrum of views on the key issues. The members would come to the group with some perspectives that were very much at odds with each other. For consensus positions to be found, it would be necessary to establish a basis for candour and trust. The participants would need to express their disagreements freely, while listening openly, with a willingness to consider changing their minds. They were to represent their own views, not serve as mouthpieces of the organizations they worked for. Confidentiality was essential. They would follow the venerable Chatham House Rule, whereby no person's comments would be quoted by name outside of the meeting room. At that first meeting, Sokolov laid out the charge. The Roundtable would carry out a series of candid discussions aimed at defining a consensus vision for exploiting the capacity of the internet and digital communications to expand access to research results, while preserving the essential aspects of scholarly publishing. She was joined by Diane DiEuliis, Assistant Director for Life Sciences in the OSTP, who affirmed President Obama's commitment to the provision of public access to government-funded information and indicated that OSTP would be issuing a formal request for information (RFI) on the topic in the near future. The participants were each given time to briefly describe their backgrounds, areas of expertise and current views. Although the initial proposal indicated that the Roundtable would be ‘chaired by representatives of the House Science and Technology Committee with appropriate support and advice from staff in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’,11 Outline and Proposal for a House Science and Technology Committee/OSTP Roundtable Public Access to Federal Research and Data. 29 May 2009. [Note: In a 23 June email to the participants Sokolov says, ‘Attached are the list of participants and the proposal (unchanged) that was originally distributed a few weeks ago with “May29” in the filename. The only change I made was to remove the S&T Committee name from the heading (although we remain in the text of the proposal) since we removed ourselves from any kind of leadership or convening role following the conclusion of the 19 June kick-off meeting. As agreed on Friday, you should feel free to share these documents with colleagues, etc.’] the participants agreed at the conclusion of the meeting that the Roundtable would be more effective if it operated independently. John Vaughn, as chair, offered to host subsequent meetings at the AAU offices. Representatives of the Committee and OSTP attended these meetings (in person or by phone), but served primarily as resources, rather than full participants. No funding or other support was provided by the Committee or OSTP. (AAU and AAP each contributed $5 K for expenses along with administrative support). Structuring the Roundtable this way ensured that the final report truly represented the independent views of the participants. The Roundtable met in person three more times (10 July, 22 July and 7 August) for 4-h sessions, with dinner the evening before. As noted above, Vaughn and Dylla believed that these shared meals were beneficial for developing the relationships necessary to support candid discussions. These discussions were part fact-finding, part advocacy, part investigation of the effects of various proposals on the full range of constituencies. Although some of the initial disagreements were intense, the focus remained clear—could they establish consensus recommendations that would inform US government policy? At the outset there was certainly some scepticism among the participants about the likelihood of achieving that. Although the initial charge to the Roundtable was quite broad and could be construed to include such research outputs as datasets and the various progress reports required by granting agencies, the group quickly agreed to concentrate on peer-reviewed publications. This was the most contentious area for the affected constituencies, and if the Roundtable was going to develop concrete recommendations in only a few months, the scope needed to be tightly focused. The members were determined to base their recommendations in fact rather than ideology and advocacy. Still, they recognized that a major research project investigating all of the relevant aspects of scholarly publication would require time and resources far beyond what they had available. In addressing this challenge, the contributions from the researchers were invaluable. They were able to bring a wealth of material covering access issues, publishing economics, the behaviour of researchers, the decision-making processes of librarians and more. Nonetheless, large gaps in the knowledge base remained. Considerable time was spent discussing business models and the effects of embargoes (i.e., the length of time between the initial publication of a research article and a version of the article being made freely available to the public). PLoS provided a detailed example of one type of OA publisher, but in general, the lack of transparency by publishers of all types, along with their vast variability, made it impossible to make more than general observations and conclusions. The data available on the effects of embargoes was scant and anecdotal, eliminating the possibility of broad fact-based conclusions. There was a shared understanding that because of the likelihood of major technological impacts in just the next few years, any policies put in place needed to be flexible and subject to change. This led many in the group to argue that a legislative mandate would be unwise because it would be difficult to modify in response to changing conditions. A better approach would be flexible policies coordinated by OSTP and developed in close consultation with all of the stakeholders. All members agreed that the federal government needed to play a role, but there continued to be strong disagreements about how extensive and prescriptive that role should be. Although the guidelines from Sokolov indicated that the group was not expected to revisit the NIH Policy, which the Committee and the White House considered settled, the Roundtable spent time discussing the perceived pros and cons of the policy in order to identify features that might be promulgated across the other federal funding agencies. By the end of the second meeting, the group had identified five possible models (including the NIH policy). They developed a scoring system that each member could use to evaluate the different models. Using feedback from the scoring sheets, a drafting committee of Dylla, O'Donnell, Taylor and Vaughn developed a ‘green paper’ draft for discussion at the last of the in-person meetings. As summer moved to fall, a set of broad recommendations emerged that all of the members felt they could generally support. The drafting team used the green paper as the basis for the first draft of the full report, which was distributed to the members in early November. There followed a series of conference calls to develop and refine the report. With the written language in front of them, the remaining disagreements sharpened. Some of the calls were contentious, and there were moments when it looked as if the entire effort might fall apart. But the members had each put in a great deal of time and effort, and the meetings during the summer had established a basis of trust, enabling the group to work through their disagreements towards mutual understanding. What the dissents come down to is a matter of control and the role of government. I hope it is not a caricature of the dissents to say that, in the end, Patterson, coming from his experience with the most successful open access publisher to date, felt that the report did not call strongly enough for a firm government hand in moving expeditiously toward full open access. He believes that it is time. Chi, informed by his experience in leadership with the most successful commercial STM publisher in the world, ultimately felt that the report allowed for too much government interference in achieving the public access goal. The disagreement is not over the necessity of expanded access, but over how fast to move and how strong a role the government should be allowed to take. This is an important discussion to have. (Plutchak, 2010) Patterson and Chi both reviewed the draft of the editorial before it was published and gave it their blessing. Patterson: ‘As far as your comments about myself are concerned, I think you're very fair. Many thanks again’ (Patterson, personal communication, 20 May 2010). Chi: ‘I think this is a very thoughtful piece and I appreciate the personal perspective that you expresses [sic] here of the substance of the RT and not the PR [i.e., public relations]. I have absolutely no objection to the accuracy of what you describe where my name is attributed’ (Chi, personal communication, 24 May 2010). The Report, along with the two dissents, was published in January 2010 and delivered to Congress and the White House (Scholarly Publishing Roundtable, 2010). Reactions from the scholarly communication community were predictably mixed. Within hours of the report's release, Peter Suber (Director of the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication and a prolific OA advocate) commented, saying that ‘[t]here's a lot to like here’. However, he focused mostly on the report's failure to call for an OA mandate. He went on, ‘One more clue as to why the group may have decided not to endorse OA mandates: The only working scientists on the panel were either in library science or had become publishers. I respect all the participants, but the panel omitted a significant, probably the most significant, stakeholder group’ (Suber, 2010). In fact, the very extensive publication records of a number of Roundtable members attest to their significant contributions as working scientists in economics, physics, humanities, neurosciences and scholarly communication. The Association of American University Publishers (AAUP) was enthusiastic, saying ‘we think it vital that the Roundtable's further recommendations, with their emphasis on consultation, cooperation, interoperability, authority, preservation and long-term sustainability be followed’ (Association of American Universities Presses, n.d.). The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM), while applauding the Roundtable's efforts and expressing support for the general principles, took issue with some of the recommendations, saying ‘while STM supports US agencies in the development of public access policies to the results of research funded by those agencies, we do not agree that the scholarly articles arising from publisher investment and value add fall under this category’ (STM, 2010). Rick Anderson (then the Associate Dean for Collections & Scholarly Communication at the University of Utah) writing in Learned Publishing, said ‘the report leaves room for traditional publishing with its explicit support for the idea of limited embargoes. If that support leaves some in the open access and STM publishing communities equally dissatisfied, that is probably a mark of success. Given the intractable economic realities that govern knowledge creation, it seems clear to me that the Roundtable's vision of a future that includes ‘diverse and flexible market-driven approaches’ is spot on’ (Anderson, 2010). In the aftermath of the Report's release, members of the Roundtable worked to promote awareness and highlight the recommendations. Editorials were written (in Science and the Journal of the Medical Library Association) (Courant et al., 2010; Plutchak, 2010) and numerous conference presentations were made (e.g., the Council of Engineering and Scientific Society Executives [CESSE], the Charleston Conference, the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers [ALPSP], UKSG [formerly the United Kingdom Serials Group]). In the fall of 2010, a comprehensive bill titled The America COMPETES Act (ACA) was brought up for its 5-year renewal as the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act (ACRA) (U.S. House of Representatives, 2010). ACRA required the establishment of an Interagency Task Force, part of which was a Public Access Committee (U.S. House of Representatives, 2011). The language describing the charge to the Committee drew directly from the Roundtable report. The bill was passed by Congress in December of 2010 and signed into law by President Obama in January 2011. Three Roundtable members (Dylla, Plutchak and Taylor) testified on these issues before Congress in March 2012. The hearing before the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology was titled ‘Federally Funded Research: Examining Public Access and Scholarly Publication Interests’. While two of the five witnesses argued for the necessity of passing FRPAA, the Roundtable members emphasized the importance of the flexibility and cross-community coordination embodied in the Report's recommendations (Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council, 2012). Also in March 2012, the aforementioned Public Access Committee delivered its report to Congress, specifying that the recommendations were based on two public RFIs and the Report from the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable (U.S. House of Representatives, 2012). The Committee's report provided important validation for the Roundtable's recommendations and OSTP's guidelines, development of which was well under way. In the spring of 2012, Michael Stebbins, the person at OSTP who was primarily responsible for drafting those guidelines, was reaching out to a number of constituencies to inform OSTP's thinking. It wasn't easy work, but the general intent and outline of the guidelines were in place. The major remaining sticking point was the length of any embargo that would be specified. SPARC and its allies were continuing to push for a maximum 6 months for all publications, arguing that the lack of demonstrable negative impacts on publishers from the NIH 12-month embargo proved that a shorter embargo would not harm publishers. Meanwhile, the publisher lobby was continuing to argue that anything shorter than 12 months would be unsustainable. They claimed the additional 6-month window was critical, because for subscription journals the typical subscription period was 12 months and more than half of total downloads frequently occurred during that period. Besides, they said, not enough time had gone by since the imposition of the NIH policy to reveal evidence of a clear impact on the subscribing patterns of librarians. In early May, several members of the Roundtable met with Stebbins. They advised cautious experimentation and flexibility. The Report had not specified a specific embargo term, recommending that ‘[t]he length of an embargo period should be as short as possible to reflect an appropriate balance between a commitment to rapid public access and the need to allow orderly evolution of business practices among established journals’ (Scholarly Publishing Roundtable, 2010). The Report also argued that different disciplines might warrant different embargo periods, but that, in general, embargoes between 0 and 12 months seemed reasonable. Over time, individual agencies might lengthen or shorten the embargo period as they and the communities they worked with gained more experience. The meeting concluded as Stebbins thanked the Roundtable members and assured them that the Report's recommendations were definitely being taken into account. Several weeks later, SPARC and its allies launched a Change.org petition, urging ‘President Obama to act now to implement open access policies for all federal agencies that fund scientific research’. Impatience with the Obama administration's lack of a public stand on open access was rising. The OSTP guidelines were well underway, but there had been no public statement from the White House, despite years of intense lobbying. The petition's organizers hoped that the petition process would force OSTP's hand, while keeping the issue alive within the larger scholarly community. The rules for Change.org specified that if a petition crossed the 25,000 signature threshold within 30 days the administration was required to respond. That number was crossed within 2 weeks (eventually reaching 65,704) and in early June the organizers claimed victory (Higgins, 2012). Nonetheless, it would be another 8 months (not until after Obama's second inauguration) before the release of the OSTP memorandum ‘Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research’ (Holdren, 2013). Coincident with that release, Dr. John Holdren, OSTP's Director, finally posted the official Obama administration response to the petition, thanking the petitioners for their participation (We the People, 2012). OSTP had ‘been looking into this issue for some time and has reached out to the public on two occasions for input on the question of how best to achieve this goal of democratizing the results of federally funded research’. The petition, he wrote, ‘has been important to our discussions’. The petition's organizers may not have gotten all they wanted or expected, but the Holdren memo, as it came to be called, was a major milestone in the advancement of public access. The OSTP guidelines would become the critical directives for federal agencies that provided $100 million or more in research funding annually. They included most of the key elements from the Roundtable report. They emphasized the importance of maintaining archives and interoperability. They encouraged public–private collaboration and innovation. They specified a maximum 12-month embargo, while encouraging flexibility and requiring agencies to establish a process for petitions, based on evidence, to adjust the embargo timeframe. Over the next few years, 22 federal agencies developed public access plans for publications and data based on the directives in this memo. As the Roundtable members anticipated, the scholarly communication landscape has changed considerably over the decade plus since the release of the Report. As a result of the Holdren memo, virtually all new peer-reviewed publications based on federally funded research are freely available, in some form, no later than 12 months after publication and in many instances much sooner. Within months, spurred on by the Holdren memo, a group of publishers began to develop CHORUS (originally an acronym for Clearing House for the Open Research of the United States, but dropped as an acronym when the organization started working in other countries) as a vehicle for providing public access to articles from the publisher sites, exemplifying the kind of public-private collaboration envisioned by the Roundtable and OSTP (Dylla & Salmon, 2020). The ARL, in cooperation with AAU and the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU—formerly NASULGC), offered another proposed solution to the public access mandate in the form of the Shared Access Research Ecosystem (SHARE), ‘a system of cross institutional digital repositories’ (Association of Research Libraries, 2013). Although open data policies were outside the scope of the Roundtable's work, they were included in the Holdren directive. While data has proven to be a much more difficult challenge, significant progress is being made. Procedures and compliance are still much more rudimentary than for publications, but all of the federal agencies now have detailed data archiving requirements. Many publishers have also developed policies that encourage or require authors to make the data supporting their articles publicly available. Open access (broadly defined) has advanced considerably, whether via innovation among publishers or by the efforts of research funders. Most publishers provide opportunities for making articles open. Plan S, developed by a coalition of European funding agencies, hopes to incentivize more publishers to develop open access policies (Plan, n.d.). Across the globe, commercial and not-for-profit publishers, national organizations, libraries and library consortia are working together to develop transformative agreements that continue to open up the world's scholarly literature. Disagreements are (still) robust and discussions and negotiations can be contentious. But progress continues to be made, as long as all of the stakeholders are willing to remain engaged and committed to seeking balanced solutions to often conflicting goals. The early proponents of open access framed it as a moral crusade. Believing that the public interest and private interests could never be reconciled, the OA movement pursued a legislative goal that would mandate a particular one size for all type of open access, regardless of what the (intended or unintended) consequences might be. The understandably defensive publishing sector was split into two quite different groups: commercial journal publishers, some of which generated generous profits with seemingly unrestrained pricing policies and not-for-profit academic and scientific society publishers, whose generally lower cost journals nonetheless produced critical revenue for their societies, whose memberships comprised primarily the researchers whose work they published. One of the paralysing results of this pitched battle was that individuals who might have been allies in other circumstances found themselves on the opposite sides of a very public rhetorical war. Both sides dug in, and very little progress could be made. The Roundtable was successful in having a major impact because it took a very different approach. Collaboration and compromise are very difficult. Trust is hard to come by. The organizers of the Roundtable believed that by bringing together people with the full range of views in an atmosphere of trust, with a willingness to listen, key people could find enough agreement to influence public policy in ways that would make a significant difference. The legislative mandates desired by the OA partisans have not come to fruition, but thanks in significant measure to that small group of determined individuals who were committed to listening to each other in the pursuit of consensus, many of the outcomes those partisans desired have come to pass. The authors were members of the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable and have no other conflicts of interest relevant to this article. All authors participated in the conceptualization and writing. T.

AB  - A number of initiatives exist in European countries to support open scholarly communication in humanities and social sciences. This article looks at the work of Open Access in the European Research Area through Scholarly Communication (OPERAS), a consortium of 36 partners from all over Europe, including many university presses, that is working to build a future European infrastructure to address the challenges in open access publishing. Their initial study, OPERAS‐D, revealed a variety of models among the partners influenced by national cultures. Although the partners’ activities were found to be fragmented, they also reflect the ‘bibliodiversity’ that exists in European societies. To address the challenge of fragmentation, it is argued that, by following a cooperative model, European actors can benefit by sharing expertise, resources, and costs of development for the good of all. As a future infrastructure to support open scholarly communication across Europe, OPERAS aims to coordinate a range of publishers and service providers to offer researchers and societies a fully functional web of services to cover the entire research lifecycle.

AB  - Abstract Open access (OA) journals distribute their content at no charge and use other means of funding the publication process. Publication fees or article‐processing charges (APC)s have become the predominant means for funding professional OA publishing. We surveyed 1,038 authors who recently published articles in 74 OA journals that charge APCs stratified into seven discipline categories. Authors were asked about the source of funding for the APC, factors influencing their choice of a journal and past history publishing in OA and subscription journals. Additional information about the journal and the authors' country were obtained from the journal website. A total of 429 (41%) authors from 69 journals completed the survey. There were large differences in the source of funding among disciplines. Journals with impact factors charged higher APCs as did journals from disciplines where grant funding is plentiful. Fit, quality, and speed of publication were the most important factors in the authors' choice of a journal. OA was less important but a significant factor for many authors in their choice of a journal to publish. These findings are consistent with other research on OA publishing and suggest that OA publishing funded through APCs is likely to continue to grow.

AB  - Purpose A major problem in today’s scholarly publishing process is the long tails for the assignment of volume and issue numbers for approved articles. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which information science journals offer early view features and the effects of these features. Design/methodology/approach The study addresses three basic questions: Do the articles approved for publication in information science journals appear in the online platforms of these journals before the assignment of volume and issue numbers? How long do the articles wait in the online platforms before they get the volume and issue numbers? Is there a statistically significant relationship between the online accessing numbers of the articles before they are published and bibliometric indicators? Findings More than half of the information science journals complete the editorial process in reasonable durations and share new articles with their readers before publishing them. In some journals, there are articles that wait for more than a year to be assigned volume and issue numbers after the completion of the editorial process. There are statistically significant differences, in terms of both their impact factor and immediacy index values, between the journals that offer early view features and those that do not. Both the impact factor and the immediacy index values of the journals that provide early view are higher than the others. Practical implications Adopting the early view policy may significantly help increase the impact factor and immediacy index values of the journals, as well as the visibility of their contents Originality/value The answers to this study’s research questions offer a new perspective to overcome the challenges in the processes through which scientific products meet with their users.

AB  - The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and its Scholarly Works Application Profile (SWAP) are used to inspire the representation of complex real world situations in the publication part of the Common European Research Information Format (CERIF), the model for Current Research Information Systems (CRIS). CERIF is found to have room for different approaches to representing metadata of scholarly publications, which could hamper the interoperability of CRIS. To lessen that risk, we propose guidelines for representing scholarly publication metadata in CERIF; our design goal is to enhance the utility of CRIS in supporting the functions of scientific communication. The guidelines are formulated using the notions of Scholarly Work, Expression and Manifestation from FRBR/SWAP.

AB  - Establishing Publication Services in the library at the University of Graz did more than broaden the service portfolio of the library. A convergence of expertise at the library, needs of researchers at the university, and ongoing changes in scholarly communication also contributed to the evolution of the library's role and profile. The new services offer first-level support for matters pertaining to scholarly publishing and communications. Furthermore, Publication Services has developed into a knowledge sharing platform, extending beyond the library to other administrative departments and creating a community of practice.

AB  - Background Scholarly publishing system relies on external peer review. However, the duration of publication process is a major concern for authors and funding bodies. Objective To evaluate the duration of the publication process in pharmacy practice journals compared with other biomedical journals indexed in PubMed. Methods All the articles published from 2009 to 2018 by the 33 pharmacy practice journals identified in Mendes et al. study and indexed in PubMed were gathered as study group. A comparison group was created through a random selection of 3000 PubMed PMIDs for each year of study period. Articles with publication dates outside the study period were excluded. Metadata of both groups of articles were imported from PubMed. The duration of editorial process was calculated with three periods: acceptance lag (days between ‘submission date’ and ‘acceptance date’), lead lag (days between ‘acceptance date’ and ‘online publication date’), and indexing lag (days between ‘online publication date’ and ‘Entry date’). Null hypothesis significance tests and effect size measures were used to compare these periods between both groups. Results The 33 pharmacy practice journals published 26,256 articles between 2009 and 2018. Comparison group random selection process resulted in a pool of 23,803 articles published in 5,622 different journals. Acceptance lag was 105 days (IQR 57–173) for pharmacy practice journals and 97 days (IQR 56–155) for the comparison group with a null effect difference (Cohen’s d 0.081). Lead lag was 13 (IQR 6–35) and 23 days (IQR 9–45) for pharmacy practice and comparison journals, respectively, which resulted in a small effect. Indexing lag was 5 days (IQR 2–46) and 4 days (IQR 2–12) for pharmacy practice and control journals, which also resulted in a small effect. Slight positive time trend was found in pharmacy practice acceptance lag, while slight negative trends were found for lead and indexing lags for both groups. Conclusions Publication process duration of pharmacy practice journals is similar to a general random sample of articles from all disciplines.

AB  - The argument that publicly funded research should be publicly available is a valid one, but it cannot be the most important one in the discussion as to whether research should be freely accessible. The overriding argument is that freely accessible research optimises the scientific process as well as its 'translation' into societal benefits. Free access, or 'open access' as it is widely called, can be brought about by making full use of the technologies available to the world, particularly the internet, but it does need a change in traditional economic models of publishing.

AB  - In the five years since the launch of the Budapest Open Access Initiative in February 2002, one of the most striking developments in the scholarly communications landscape has been the increasing interest taken in open access at a policy level. Today, open access (in the form of both self-archiving and open access journals) is routinely discussed and debated at an institutional-level, within research-funding bodies, nationally, and internationally. The debate has moved out of the library and publisher communities to take a more central place in discussions on the ‘knowledge economy’, return on investment in research, and the nature of e-science. This paper looks at some of the public policy drivers that are impacting on scholarly communications and describes the major policy initiatives that are supporting a move to open access.

AB  - In August, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a new policy requiring that all federally funded scholarly research be accessible to the public immediately upon publication. While this open access policy will ultimately benefit society by increasing the availability of data and research outputs, it could place a heavy burden on researchers due to the relatively high cost of open access alongside an academic culture that tends to favor publishing in high impact subscription journals. We examine the complexities of the traditional publishing landscape and offer recommendations for agencies, universities, and publishers to mitigate the impacts on researchers. Specifically, we recommend a short-term increase in funding to cover higher publishing costs, but contributions from all stakeholders are needed to facilitate a long-term solution.

AB  - Scientific researchers around the world are increasingly publishing in English. In parallel, local or regional scientific journals are also perhaps increasingly becoming English periodicals. I congratulate the editors of Science Editing for their efforts to bring this journal to the international stage by publishing articles in English. Nowadays, researchers who are non-native English speakers often recognize that they need some kind of assistance with the English language to become successful communicators of their work. Similarly, non-native English speaking (NNES) journal editors who wish to start publishing their journals in English may also benefit from more awareness of the language aspect of publishing. This article is aimed at NNES journal editors who wish to improve the standard of English in their journals.

AB  - This study investigated the publishing patterns of information science academics in Kenya. Using a bibliometric approach, the author conducted an analysis of the quantity, quality and visibility of the publications indexed by Google Scholar. Data for the analysis was collected using Harzing’s “Publish or Perish” software from Google Scholar and presented using VOSviewer software. The findings of the study revealed low quantity, quality and visibility of research publications by information science academics in Kenya. Twenty (22.4%) serving academics are yet to publish any scholarly work. Similarly, 185 (42%) of the published papers have not been cited. This low publishing performance can be attributed to lack of scholarly communication skills; inadequate research funding and facilitation; limited access to scholarly communication channels; and heavy teaching workloads, among other factors. The quantity, quality and visibility of publications by information science academics in Kenya can be enhanced by training the lecturers on scholarly communication; accrediting journals and publishers; increasing research funding; strengthening research collaboration; increasing scholarly forums and platforms; and balancing lecturers’ teaching and research workloads.

AB  - ABSTRACT Sydney eScholarship is a framework and suite of services that enables integration of digital collections, open access repositories, and research data services with scholarly publishing. The primary platform for scholarly publishing at the University of Sydney – Sydney University Press – currently operates as part of the University Library's Sydney eScholarship program. Three sets of publishing initiatives demonstrate the integration of the digital library with scholarly publishing to deliver different forms to different audiences: (i) new publishing and the literary canons – rediscovery, customisation and critical interpretations; (ii) book and web – open access publishing; (iii) publishing in the mix – data and experimental scholarly publishing.

AB  - At a time of great dynamism among publishers of scientific publications, with the inevitability of Open Access and the ease of publishing online at low cost, it is possible to find publications with different levels of scientific respectability. In this context, the improvement of the quality of scholarly publications emerges as a critical element for publishers, authors and academic institutions, as well as for society in general. This opinion piece discusses Open Access journals with different levels of quality, focusing on the following quality-promoting measures: blacklists, author’s preparation, and institutional prevention. The analysis allows concluding that the open review will be one of the key elements in the process of clarification and promotion of the level of quality and consequent scientific respectability of each of the Journals, of the thousands currently existing, a number that is likely to increase.

C1  - Digital License Compliance, IEEE,
AB  - Sci-Hub has been referred to as the "Robin Hood" of science, but in reality, it is not. Sci-Hub is a disruption to the entire scholarly publishing research cycle. Over the last three years, the amount of licensed e-content that has been illegally obtained by Sci-Hub has grown significantly. This content has been acquired through stolen institutional staff and student credentials. Acquiring and misappropriating these credentials creates serious risks for an institution's systems and users as well as publishers. What can libraries and publishers do to minimize or eliminate these infractions? This discussion about the collective efforts of publishers, libraries, and other organizations will cover how to protect electronic resources, personal data, and adopting best practices in order to better defend from cyberattacks that compromise our organizations. We will discuss how these attacks can occur and steps you can take to protect your library. While, unfortunately, there is no one single solution for this problem, we will also look at a case study of a library that successfully implemented some of these practices to combat the cyberattacks. Through this we will demonstrate that together we can reduce the risks facing researchers, librarians, and publishers created by Sci-Hub.

AB  - In our previous editorial (Khandekar et al. 2021), we noted the blackboxing of scholarly publication infrastructure that we encountered when we assumed editorship of the journal. We outlined several aspects of infrastructuring that we have undertaken since, with an explicit goal of supporting transnational workflows and participation in ESTS. In this editorial, we continue describing our infrastructural work, highlighting especially the work of content production at ESTS. We also discuss the relevance of our infrastructural work for open access (OA) scholarly publishing.

AB  - Open access (OA) publishing rates have risen dramatically in the biomedical sciences in the past decade. However, few studies have focused on the publishing activities and attitudes of early career researchers. The aim of this study was to examine current publishing activities of clinical and research fellows and their perceptions of OA publishing and public access.This study employed a mixed methods approach. Data on publications authored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center fellows between 2013 and 2018 were collected via an in-house author profile system and citation indexes. Journals were categorized according to SHERPA/RoMEO classifications. In-person and telephone interviews were conducted with fifteen fellows to discern their perceptions of OA publishing.The total percentage of fellows' publications that were freely available OA was 28.6%, with a relatively flat rate between 2013 and 2018. Publications with fellows as first authors were significantly more likely to be OA. Fellows cited high article processing charges (APCs) and perceived lack of journal quality or prestige as barriers to OA publishing. Fellows generally expressed support for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) public access policy.While the fellows in this study acknowledged the potential of OA to aid in research dissemination, they also expressed hesitation to publish OA related to confusion surrounding legitimate OA and predatory publications and frustration with APCs. Fellows supported the NIH public access policy and accepted it as part of their research process. Health sciences information professionals could potentially leverage this acceptance of public access to advocate for OA publishing.

AB  - Open access publishing is now an accepted method of scholarly communication. However, the greatest traction for open access publishing thus far has been in the sciences. Penetration of open access publishing has been much slower among the social sciences. This study surveys 309 authors from recent issues of open access journals in education to determine why they choose to publish in open access journals and to gain insight into the ways publishing practices within the discipline itself impact the willingness of authors to engage in open access publishing.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to review the trend in academic libraries toward including scholarly communication, and by extension, electronic publishing, as part of their core mission, using the Cornell University Library as an example. Design/methodology/approach The paper describes several manifestations of publishing activity organized under the Library's Center for Innovative Publishing, including the arXiv ( http://arxiv.org/ ), Project Euclid ( http://projecteuclid.org ), and DPubS ( http://DPubS.org ). Findings Libraries bring many competencies to the scholarly communications process, including expertise in digital initiatives, close connections with authors and readers, and a commitment to preservation. To add publishing to their responsibilities, they need to develop expertise in content acquisition, editorial management, contract negotiation, marketing, and subscription management. Originality/value Academic libraries are making formal and informal publishing a part of their core activity. A variety of models exist. The Cornell University Library has created a framework for supporting publishing called the Center for Innovative Publishing, and through it supports a successful open access repository (arXiv), a sustainable webhosting service for journals in math and statistics (Project Euclid) and a content management tool (DPubS) to enable other institutions (libraries, scholarly societies, presses) to engage in similar ventures to increase the dissemination of scholarship and to lower the barriers to its access.

AB  - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) public access policy mandates that all articles containing NIH-funded research must be deposited into PubMed Central (PMC). The aim of this study was to assess publishing trends of journals that were not selected for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) collection but contain NIH-funded articles submitted to PMC in compliance with the public access policy. In addition, the authors investigated the degree to which NIH-funded research is published in journals that NLM does not collect due to concerns with the publishers.We analyzed bibliographic data from the NIH Manuscript Submission system for journals that were not selected for the NLM collection from August 2015 to August 2016. Publications (n=738) were analyzed by language, publishing country, publishing format, and subject, and the results were compared to a similar study of 2008-2009 data. In addition, publications were analyzed by whether their publishers are collected by NLM, as determined by transparency and adherence to publishing best practices.Only a few differences were found between the studies. Most notably, while both studies revealed that most journals were not selected for the NLM collection because they were out of scope (i.e., not biomedical), we noted an increase in 2015-2016 in biomedical journals containing NIH-funded articles that were not added to the collection due to concerns with the publishers.While the current number of NIH-funded manuscripts being published by publishers that are not collected by NLM remains quite small, we noted a substantial increase between 2008-2009 and 2015-2016.

AB  - Increasing the role of libraries in academic journal publishing activities and journal hosting has become an important subject in the library world in the past few years. The purpose of this study is to present the role of the libraries at University of Stavanger (UiS) in the context of library-as-publisher. Within this category, open access (OA) journal publishing has been a popular service offered by libraries, rapidly attracting researchers' attention. The University Libraries at University of Stavanger (UiS) have a long history of promoting and supporting open access initiatives. The Libraries have established and continue to build, host and maintain an operative open access institutional repository (UiS Brage) for scientific works in full text.&#x0D; From 2018, UiS libraries started using a journal management system to facilitate the open access scholarly publishing and therefore support transferring and updating of established the existing journals and the lunching of new ones. The Open Journal Systems (OJS) from Public Knowledge Project (PKP) is used which is the most common journal management system being discussed frequently in literature.&#x0D; Currently, the UiS Libraries repository host four active open access journals, with some others under development. All these journals reside within the same OJS implementation with the same design and layout on top, however, at the individual journal level there are also options for some customization.&#x0D; UiS libraries initially support all the steps of the journal creation and development process but train the editors and the subsequent users to engage in some part of the process. The library IT-Engineer and Information Technology Department (IT) manage OJS server, maintain the OJS database and software, and performs the layout and design customization and development and initial technical configuration for the new journals.&#x0D; From the viewpoint of IT, there is a need for several technical skills such as web design skills to customize the style sheets and web layout, graphic design skills to produce banners, logos and cover pages whereas the editorial workflow process may require skills on copy-editing and proofreading of articles. OJS is a template-based platform but when it comes to front-end design, it has its limitation. There are certain limitations which make it difficult to get to the details of the article. For instance, when an article comes with a long abstract or number of references, the web-page becomes unfriendly. Another challenge is when PKP launches a new OJS update. Some features cannot be migrated, and you may lose them. Furthermore, users may find it hard to adapt to the new version. The biggest challenge to the OJS is the learning curve. There are some faculty members who have had some frustrations with the software.&#x0D; While it is a free and open source platform, the time, technical skills and programming abilities are still associated with the costs. In this poster we provide you with the challenges and lessons learned so far by the libraries at Stavanger University.

AB  - The study based on an online survey covering 655 researchers from hard and soft sciences addresses the influence of different conditions on academic publishing. Results show that (1) hard sciences academics publish more than soft sciences; (2) there are resemblances in academic publishing; (3) there are differences in the sufficient conditions sets for the two groups of sciences which may be explained by differences in scientific conceptual frameworks and research methods applied in each group of disciplines; (4) conditions leading to the absence of publishing reveal similarities and differences among hard and soft sciences academics. The study contribute to: (1) the debate on the questionable generalization of scientific publications indexes and rankings due to the nature of research published coming from different scientific universes; (2) identify pathways for achieving higher performance in academic publishing; (3) allow research centers' managers to better manage the centers aiming to achieve upper output levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND Students pursuing advanced degrees are increasingly expected to contribute to their discipline’s scholarly discourse during their tenure in graduate school. However, they are often unsure of how or where to begin the publishing process, and do not always feel comfortable asking for help from their faculty advisors or fellow students. Scholars, including librarians, have attempted to address these concerns by developing tools and services to meet the needs of future faculty. In recent years, university presses and research libraries have recognized their shared mission in furthering scholarship, with libraries themselves offering publishing education and expertise. PROJECT OVERVIEW During the 2012-2013 academic year, subject librarians and publishing professionals at the University of Michigan Library crafted a program to address students’ questions and concerns about the publishing lifecycle. This ongoing initiative includes a multi-semester workshop series developed in concert with faculty from departments throughout campus, as well as a supplementary online toolkit that takes into account the rapidly evolving nature of scholarly communication. LESSONS LEARNED Major takeaways from this program include: the value of student assessment in shaping publishing workshops; awareness of the discrepancies of registration numbers and actual attendance, highlighting the potential for enhanced promotion techniques; the importance of university press and faculty insight; and the benefits of collaboration among librarians, publishing professionals, and faculty members. NEXT STEPS Future iterations of this program will incorporate in-depth assessment of each program, a more interactive learning environment, and better scheduling and promotion of the workshop series.

AB  - Publishing in peer-reviewed journals is an integral part of the conduct of modern science. The value of publishing for scientists employed in the public sector is obvious. The primary measure of research value, productivity, reputation, and credibility in the public sector is the published journal article; if you will, it is the main productivity metric of public research institutions. But we have different productivity metrics in the private sector; our primary measure of value are products and services that enter the marketplace that meet or exceed the expectations of paying customers. So, why should scientists employed by the private sector be concerned about publishing in refereed journals? After all, corporations, such as agricultural products companies, do not generate revenue from “scholarly” publishing. Publishing is not mentioned in our company’s mission, vision, or corevalues statements. Further, publishing may require considerable company resources that arguably could be directed to projects that seem to provide a real and tangible return. In this article, we build a case for the importance of publishing by private-sector scientists. We focus on the importance of publishing for business reasons but also discuss the importance of publishing for individual scientists to build their credibility and to enhance their professional development.

TI  - Publish or perish? Innovative models for scholarly publishing in Zimbabwe
AU  - Chirisa, Nomsa
AU  - Ngoepe, Mpho

AB  - Innovative publishing models have emerged to meet the demands of the ‘publish or perish’ philosophy prevalent in academic and scholarly circles. Publishing models serve as the operational blueprint underpinning the value and supply chains of products in the publishing industry, aligning operational plans, design strategies, and production methodologies with the overarching goal of scholarly publishing. The duty of scholarly publishers to advance knowledge and disseminate it widely necessitates their role in supporting researchers to meet the expectations of the ‘publish or perish’ culture. This philosophy becomes even more critical in the endangered landscape of scholarly publishing in Africa, where scholarly publishing is evidently perishing, as researchers in the region face additional challenges in accessing reputable publishing outlets for their work. Zimbabwe has a low research publishing output, and although it ranks second in southern Africa, it lags behind South Africa by an astounding 65%. This intensifies the pressure to publish to maintain visibility and credibility within the global academic community. This paper thus examines the publishing models implemented in the publishing of scholarly works by scholarly publishers in Zimbabwe. Qualitative data were collected through the Delphi Technique design, with publishing experts over three rounds of interviews, and triangulated with data from document analysis. The key findings indicate open access, self-publishing, and collaborative publishing as effective market models for university presses. However, Zimbabwean universities are still lagging behind, as few have established university presses.

AB  - This study evaluates e‐book publishing by professional life and physical science societies. In order to be good stewards of their resources, collection managers should always be aware of digital rights management (DRM) restrictions and access issues when contemplating an e‐book purchase. This can be difficult due to the wide variety of publishing models employed by society e‐book publishers. In this study the authors examine various life and physical science societies that publish e‐books, including factors such as DRM and access conditions, and purchasing options. The results provide information for collection managers to consider when purchasing e‐books from society publishers, as well as allows them to advise patrons when access to ebooks may be limited to society members.

AB  - Stakeholders might have diverging or conflicting expectations about the functions that peer review should fulfil. We aimed to explore how stakeholder groups perceive peer review and what they expect from it. We conducted qualitative focus group workshops with early‐, mid‐, and senior career scholars, editors, and publishers. We recruited participants following a purposive maximum variation sampling approach. To identify purposes of peer review, we conducted a thematic analysis. Stakeholders expected peer review (1) to assess the contributions of a manuscript, (2) to conduct quality control, (3) to improve manuscripts, (4) to assess the suitability of manuscripts for a journal, (5) to provide a decision‐making tool for editors, (6) to provide feedback by peers, (7) to curate a community, and (8) to provide a seal of accreditation for published articles. Stakeholders with different roles and tasks in the peer review process differed in the value they attached to the functions of peer review. Early‐ and mid‐career researchers valued social and feedback functions of peer review, while senior career researchers and editors expected it to instead perform a technical assessment of manuscripts and serve as a decision‐making tool. Publishers expected peer review to assess the suitability of manuscripts for their journals and to provide a seal of accreditation. This revealed a potential tension between functions of peer review. Stakeholder expectations are shaped by how stakeholders perceive their own roles both in relation to the peer review process and within their scientific community.

AU  - Regala, Jennifer
AB  - Social media is a powerful tool. No matter how many followers one has or how many likes any given post receives, every message has an audience. And a post never goes away. Even a deleted post can be captured for posterity via screenshot. Why are the power and longevity of social media so important to consider? It is imperative for each one of us to think about how we want to appear to our social media followers. At work, we are careful to portray ourselves politely and professionally in meetings and emails. During a job interview, we don our best business garb, sit up straight, and talk clearly. Social media should not be any different. As easy as it is to sit behind a keyboard or phone screen and impulsively type a hot take to share with the world, I implore you to consider your voice, tone, and style just like you would if you were sitting in your organization’s conference room to give an important presentation. We all have watched public figures fall quickly from favor after a tasteless post or photo. It only takes one misstep to lose years of hard-earned respect. This article is not intended to discourage you from using social media. By all means, use it, but use it well. Understand that you are not just sharing a private conversation with your best friend. You are sharing your thoughts with a much larger audience. It’s up to you how you use that power, whether you […]

AB  - The appeal of metric evaluation of research impact has attracted considerable interest in recent times. Although the public at large and administrative bodies are much interested in the idea, scientists and other researchers are much more cautious, insisting that metrics are but an auxiliary instrument to the qualitative peer-based judgement. The goal of this article is to propose availing of such a well positioned construct as domain taxonomy as a tool for directly assessing the scope and quality of research. We first show how taxonomies can be used to analyze the scope and perspectives of a set of research projects or papers. Then we proceed to define a research team or researcher's rank by those nodes in the hierarchy that have been created or significantly transformed by the results of the researcher. An experimental test of the approach in the data analysis domain is described. Although the concept of taxonomy seems rather simplistic to describe all the richness of a research domain, its changes and use can be made transparent and subject to open discussions.

AB  - This article discusses the future of quality control in an academic publication system that will be largely based on electronic publishing. Information and communication technologies both challenge traditional ways and open remedies for existent problems of present gate-keeping. New forms of ex-ante and of ex-post quality control may partly replace and partly amend peer review, citation indices and quality filters based on the reputation of the publisher. Open peer review, online commenting, rating, access counts and use tracking are evaluated and put in perspective. Refuting the common argument that e-publishing leads to less quality, this paper puts forward scenarios of the future quality control system. Most likely, we shall see mixed systems, combining old and new elements, of different shapes in the different research fields.

AB  - With the emergence of the National Science Foundation requirement for data management plans, academic librarians have increasingly aided researchers in developing these plans and disseminating research data. To determine the overall quality of data management plans at Wayne State University, the Library System’s Research Data Services team evaluated the content of 119 plans from National Science Foundation grant proposals submitted between 2012 and 2014. The results of our content analysis indicate that, while most researchers understand the need to share data, many data management plans fail to adequately describe the data generated by the project, how data will be managed during the project, or how data will be preserved and shared after the completion of the project. Our results also show that data management plan deficiencies vary across academic units, suggesting the need for differentiated outreach services to improve the strength of data management plans in future National Science Foundation grant proposals.

AB  - The purpose of this Theme Section (TS) is to discuss various aspects of quality, and quality assurance, in science publishing.While we will each have our own views about exactly what this means, the editorial policy statement of the Council of Science Editors uses the following adjectives in reference to the quality of a scientific journal's content: accurate, valid, reliable, credible, authoritative, relevant to the journal's scope and mission, readable, and comprehensible.A standard dictionary definition of quality control is: '…a method of establishing and maintaining a high level of quality in a product or process through careful organizing, constant checking and painstaking corrections.'In this context, most of us would probably agree that the publisher, the editorial board, the reviewers and (not least) the authors are all involved in creating, defining, measuring and maintaining quality.Thus, we asked a cross-section of people with experience of one or more aspects of science publishing to present their views on the theme.The main points of consensus that emerge from the essays follow.Most contributors identified the importance of good scientific writing.When a manuscript has not been well written by the author(s), thorough and professionally astute editing is a necessity.This requires great care to preserve the exactness of the text despite possibly significant revisions, restructuring, and/or deletion of what is unsuitable, superfluous and/or badly written.This task is shared by the reviewers of the manuscript's scientific content, and by copy editors.The former focus on what is, or is not, essential to the scientific story being told, and the latter on the clarity of the prose and the correctness of the grammar and syntax.This process takes time, but it is worth waiting for if the result is something that will be more easily read.This is the essence of production quality.The fundamental importance of good scientific judgement in deciding a manuscript's fate was mentioned by all contributors.This crucial decision must be taken by a hands-on Editor who is an acknowledged authority in the subject area of any particular article, and who is a respected scientist capable and courageous enough to arbitrate openly and fairly when confronted with divergent views among authors and reviewers.The sheer number of manuscripts received by our discipline's most successful scholarly journals (over 700 per year at MEPS alone), and the wondrous breadth of their subject matter, makes this an extremely challenging task.The views expressed here suggest that the 'Subject Editors plus Editor-in-Chief' model is probably the best way of assuring scientific quality, as well as being more transparent and accountable than alternative models of editorial decision making.Authors themselves are best positioned to decide upon the most appropriate Subject Editor to handle the evaluation process.There should be a sufficient number of Subject Editors to cover the journal's scope: no more, lest they become idle and their title meaningless, and no less, to ensure that the workload is reasonably distributed and that they are only responsible for papers that fall within their own field of expertise.Subject Editors must be actively engaged in the review process, able to dissect the arguments of authors and reviewers alike and to provide guidance and leadership, and thus arrive at decisions that are transparent and well founded.Their decisions should still be open to appeal to an Editor-in-Chief, a person of recognised eminence and broad experience, and that decision would be final.The Editor-in-Chief, presumably in consultation with the rest of the Editorial Board, and the Publisher, would set a common Editorial policy and ensure that it is consistently applied.This system is not yet widely applied in marine science publishing, but it is the most common decision-making framework

AB  - An increasing portion of biomedical research relies on the use of biobanks and databases. Sharing of such resources is essential for optimizing knowledge production. A major obstacle for sharing bioresources is the lack of recognition for the efforts involved in establishing, maintaining and sharing them, due to, in particular, the absence of adequate tools. Increasing demands on biobanks and databases to improve access should be complemented with efforts of end-users to recognize and acknowledge these resources. An appropriate set of tools must be developed and implemented to measure this impact. To address this issue we propose to measure the use in research of such bioresources as a value of their impact, leading to create an indicator: Bioresource Research Impact Factor (BRIF). Key elements to be assessed are: defining obstacles to sharing samples and data, choosing adequate identifier for bioresources, identifying and weighing parameters to be considered in the metrics, analyzing the role of journal guidelines and policies for resource citing and referencing, assessing policies for resource access and sharing and their influence on bioresource use. This work allows us to propose a framework and foundations for the operational development of BRIF that still requires input from stakeholders within the biomedical community.

AB  - Nowadays, Open Access Mega-Journals (OAMJs) represent a substantial part of the scholarly communication system. The current research is conducted with the aim of providing better insights into the increasingly important OAMJ phenomenon through investigation of eight reputable titles using established bibliometric methods. Results of the study showed that eight studied OAMJs were responsible for 1.87% of the total number of publication indexed in Web of Science during 2012-2016. Despite the decline in publication count of PLOS ONE over the past couple of years, it was the biggest journal in the world till 2017, when Scientific Reports overtook PLOS ONE as the most productive journal. Over 88% of the papers published in eight selected OAMJs were cited at-least once at the point in time of analysis. The highest proportions of cited and un-cited documents were seen in Scientific Reports and SpringerPlus, respectively. With regard to the three indicators, namely share of highly-cited papers, the category normalized citation impact as well as the JIF percentile, IEEE Access had by far the best performance among eight examined OAMJs. Results of the study revealed that Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology, Multidisciplinary Sciences, Neurosciences, Oncology and Immunology were the most commonly assigned subject categories to OAMJs’ content. The National Natural Science Foundation of China was the most important funding agency that supported the publication of around 26000 articles in eight studied OAMJs. Investigation of the geographic distribution of authors showed that the United States and China by far had the highest contribution in the content of eight studied OAMJs. There were, however, notable variations between different OAMJs.

TI  - Question all assumptions: <i>Learned Publishing</i> at 30
IS  - 2
VL  - 31
AU  - Smart, Pippa
AB  - Looking backward – Striding forward 2018 marks the 30th birthday of Learned Publishing and has made us consider what role the journal has played, continues to play, and should play in the evolving world of scholarly publishing. Our world has changed (almost) out of all recognition in the past three decades. This is largely due to developments in technology, which have shaped and influenced the changing expectations of what should be the norm for scholarly research publishing. We believe that the role of Learned Publishing within this environment is to provide evidence that helps everyone involved with scholarly publishing to make better decisions. Alongside facts and figures we have also published informed opinions from thought-leaders that discuss ‘hot topics’ and it is interesting to track the ebb and flow of themes over the past three decades. What is particularly striking is the move away from acceptance and defence of the traditional model that the journal published 30 years ago to more recent articles that (directly or indirectly) challenge the assumptions on which the current journal publishing environment is based. It is a terrible cliché to say that we have reached a crossroads, but perhaps it is correct to say that the watershed moment is imminent. Large and small influential changes seem to be introduced daily: from the launch of large funder publishing platforms (e.g. Wellcome Open), to evolving funder mandates (e.g. the UK Research and Innovation's OA monograph requirement in the Research Excellent Framework), to new quality metrics (e.g. Dimensions) and new journals offering innovative editorial and publishing methods (too many to mention). There are also an increasing number of advocacy events (e.g. OA week) to raise awareness of open science and challenge acceptance of the traditional publishing model. In such an uncertain environment, it becomes more important for society and other publishers to question the current models when deciding how to move forward – whilst also continuing to publish and remain financially secure. Although to some it may appear that publishers are going about business as usual with scant regard for the raging debates, our articles have demonstrated a wealth of developments and broad thinking about the issues at hand. This is a topic that receives regular attention in the journal (e.g. Morris, 2009) although mostly without resolution. Whilst some modifications to the journal model have been made (e.g. PLOS One, F1000Research, Frontiers journals), the basic model remains persistent. Perhaps the reason for this is that the model continues to fulfil the needs of academia (Nicholas et al., 2017). For tenure, promotion, and job security researchers are still required to publish, and to publish in ‘quality’ journals. The definition of quality is frequently restricted to ‘high impact factor’ (IF) and no matter how many debates there are about the limitations of the IF, and the alternative metrics on offer, it is to the IF that researchers around the world turn (Bodaghi, Sanni, & Zainab, 2015; O'Neill, 2000). This presents challenges for researchers and publishers alike – how can new models be developed and supported when researchers (especially early career researchers, and those in emerging economies) still need to publish in the established, traditional, journals? Allied with the question of the model is the question of how – and why – different journals add value to research, and how they, in their turn, can be valued. Pricing and value were hot topics in the 1990s and early 2000s (Cox, 2002; Singleton, 1994), and although there are few recent articles that directly talk about pricing, there are many articles that discuss the value-added services that publishers add (see, e.g. the January 2017 issue on discoverability, and Nicholas et al., 2017). One of the value-added services, managing the peer review services (which, of course, rely on the good will of researchers and academics), is a perennial topic, with over 50 articles published in the journal asking how we can improve the reviewing process and provide proper reward and recognition (e.g. Nicholson et al., 2015; Warne, 2016). Bibliometrics are frequently used to judge the value of a journal and we have seen a growth of bibliometric articles in the past few years. These range from evaluating specific indexes (e.g. the ESCI, Somoza-Fernández, Rodríguez-Gairín, & Urbano, 2018) to the effects of publishing a single high-impact article (Liu, Liu, Zuo, & Zhu, 2018) and present many other analyses used to determine impact. One question that has been discussed frequently in the past decade is what role societies, universities, and libraries should play in the publishing environment. As expected there are many articles asking what value journals bring to societies, both financial and reputational. There are frequently tensions between the mandate of a learned society to promote their discipline and the need for income to support its activities, and articles covering this topic appear throughout the journal's history (from Shelock, 1990, to Johnson & Fosci, 2015). Library publishing has emerged as a key topic more recently, although library-based initiatives (MUSE, Highwire, etc.) were discussed back in 1999 (Treloar, 1999). More recent articles have tracked new library and university-based presses (often closely allied with the institutional library, see Glahn, 2015), in particular the growth of these within the UK (see Lockett & Speicher, 2016, and the 2016 special issue on university presses, and the special Redux issue due for publication this year, 2018). One more recent topic that has emerged is the question of diversity and inclusion. This includes issues such as gender diversity (see Kane & Meadows, 2016), geographical inclusion, and accessibility for visually impaired. Publishers seem increasingly aware that we need to ensure that our practices are inclusive, not exclusive, and several recent articles reflect concerns and present experiences to suggest how discrepancies can be addressed. In common with many western publishers, we have seen an increase in the number of original research articles from outside the US/UK/western regions, and these have provided us with some unexpected perspectives – for example, why authors from some regions do not choose western journals for their work (Kurt, 2018). Regional diversity can be a challenge for editors and publishers alike when it comes to balancing perspectives, quality, and workload throughout the editorial processes (Gaston & Smart, 2018). Many journals have been experiencing a tremendous growth of articles from China (indeed, according to the recent National Science Foundation (NSF) statistics, China-based authors are now publishing more than US-based authors: NSF, 2018). Likewise, we have also received and published many more articles from this country in the past decade. Our articles reveal a wealth of research about Chinese research and publishing (e.g. Stanley & Shuai, 2007; Wang, Deng, You, Zhang, & Chen, 2017) and about international publishing partnerships (e.g. Lin & Zhan, 2016). Although regional diversity is often a challenge for publishers, it can also be an opportunity and our articles provide insights into the publishing and research environments in a wide range of countries. A more recent concern to add to these issues is the question of how well we make published content available to all, regardless of (dis)ability. To raise awareness of these challenges, the January 2018 issue was themed on accessibility, and the article from Bill Kasdorf (2018) neatly summarizes the problems and opportunities for publishers in ensuring fully compliant accessible material. When the journal first launched there was a regular column about copyright, and it remained a hot topic throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s (see the article from Sandy Thatcher in 1995 and compare to the more recent Dodds, 2018). However in the past 5 years, the conversation has changed. Although there are still discussions about fair use (or fair dealing) and changes to copyright exceptions, most articles now focus on unauthorized scholarly reuse of published articles (e.g. Tenopir et al., 2017) and fraudulent publishers (e.g. Martin & Martin, 2016). ResearchGate has come under some scrutiny in the journal – showing how ubiquitous it is to scholars’ lives (e.g. Borrego, 2017), and how misunderstood it is by the same scholars (e.g. Nicholas, Clark, & Herman, 2016). We have also published many articles on predatory publishing that range from accusing the gold OA model for encouraging fraudulent publishing (Beall, 2013), to criticizing the polarity of judging journals to be either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ (Eriksson & Helgesson, 2017; Smart, 2017), to asking why authors choose to publish in them (Kurt, 2018). One area of constant debate is, of course, open or closed access. We have published many, many articles on this topic (75 with ‘OA’ in their titles) including research and case studies reporting on different journal models (e.g. Wakeling et al., 2017), establishing or flipping OA journals (e.g. Laakso, Solomon, & Björk, 2016; Sondervan & Stigter, 2017), repositories (e.g. Borrego, 2017; Brand, 2012), financing (Lara, 2015), policies (e.g. Anderson, 2016; Armbruster, 2011), as well as articles presenting arguments for and against OA (e.g. Cooney-McQuat, Busch, & Kahn, 2010). Whilst the principle of OA publishing is now well established, the debate over financing continues – and provocative articles continue to raise debate and discussion (e.g. Green, 2017). Looking back over the content published in the past 30 years, it has been fascinating to track the progress of the journal from what was essentially a newsletter to becoming a combined research and opinion journal. It has also been illuminating to see the variety of opinions and research presented and has revealed some topics of transitory importance, and some that are fundamental to the development of scholarly communication and the role of publishers. Striding into the future, we aim to continue evolving – referring to the evidence that we publish to help inform our own decisions. With this in mind, we are expanding our editorial board by taking on more international editors, a student editor, and our first statistical editor. We have agreed to retain the thematic January issue as a way to capture ‘hot topics’, and hope to use the new journal platform to create thematic collections. We continue to receive articles with original research, and informed comment that discuss the future of publishing: and we hope to keep raising questions for further research. We encourage anyone in our industry to think beyond ‘White Papers’ and internal reports and consider publishing with the journal as a way of registering and recording their research for future analysis. We look forward to the next 30 years.

AB  - SUMMARY We question whether blacklists are the best answer to the serious problem of predatory journals. In conjunction with the worrying recent rise in the number of predatory journals, a remarkable number of blacklists have been compiled for specific scientific fields. However, predatory journals are continuously changing names and publishers; they are set up to make easy money and buried shortly after. Predatory journals have such a rapidly evolving nature that it is hard to keep track of them and keep blacklists up to date. We therefore propose a focus on ‘whitelists’ and directories of virtuous journals rather than on blacklists of pseudo-journals. We suggest that a set of criteria be determined that journals have to meet to be qualify as legitimate. In addition, the scientific community should come up with strategies to close the established biomedical databases to predatory journals, thus preventing them from achieving global exposure. DECLARATION OF INTEREST None.

AB  - Predatory journals are a well-known issue for scholarly publishing and they are repositories for bogus research. In recent years, the number of predatory journals has risen and it is necessary to present a solution for this challenge. In this paper, we will discuss about a possible ranking of predatory journals. Our ranking approach is based on Beall's criteria for detection of predatory journals and it can help editors to improve their journals or convert their questionable journals to non-predatory ones. Moreover, our approach could help young editors to protect their journals against predatory practice. Finally, we present a case study to clarify our approach.

AB  - The descriptive concepts of “semantic” taxonomies are assigned to content items of the publishing domain for supporting a plethora of operations, mostly regarding the organization and discoverability of the content, as well as for recommendation tasks. However, either not all publishers rely on such structures, or in many cases employ their own proprietary taxonomies, thus the content is either difficult to be retrieved by the end users or stored in publisher-specific fragmented “data-silos”, respectively. To address these issues, the modular and scalable “Dominance Metric” methodology is proposed for rating the dominance and importance of concepts in semantic taxonomies. Our proposed metric is applied both on the vast multidisciplinary Microsoft Academic Graph Fields of Study taxonomy and the MeSH controlled vocabulary in order for their enhanced and refined versions to be produced. Moreover, we describe the cleansing process of the resulting taxonomy from Microsoft’s structure by deduplicating concepts and refining the hierarchical relations towards the increase of its representation quality. Our evaluation procedure provided valuable insights by showcasing that high volume, namely the number of publications a concept is assigned to, does not necessarily imply high influence, but the latter is also affected by the structural and topological properties of the individual entities.

AB  - In 2013, Jeffrey Beall published an attack on the open-access scholarship movement in tripleC: “The Open-Access Movement Is Not Really About Open Access”. This article examines the claims and arguments of that contribution. Beall’s article makes broad generalizations about open-access advocates with very little supporting evidence, but his rhetoric provides good examples of what Albert O. Hirschman called the “rhetoric of reaction”. Specifically, it provides examples of the perversity thesis, the futility thesis, and the jeopardy thesis in action. While the main argument is both unsound and invalid, it does show a rare example of reactionary rhetoric from a librarian.

AB  - ABSTRACT For ten years CIBER has been studying the logs of scholarly publishers, and what was clear from the very beginning was that scholars conducted very brief visits to websites and spent very little time reading when there, yet publishers envisaged they would dwell; and if not dwell, then at least deep read the PDF later. Yet CIBER's research points to the fact that ‘lite’ reading is in fact endemic: younger people prefer it anyway and older people are getting used to it for the speed and convenience it brings. PDFs are largely a means of archiving and collecting and are not the gold standard reading metric people think. User satisfaction comes not from a PDF but from the ability to deep dive into a site and snatch what you are interested as quickly as possible. Publishers are still not comfortable with that and this article helps explain why they have to be.

AB  - To support migration from print to electronic resources, the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library at Yale University reorganized its Technical Services Department to focus on managing electronic resources.The library hired consultants to help plan the changes and to present recommendations for integrating electronic resource management into every position. The library task force decided to focus initial efforts on the periodical collection. To free staff time to devote to electronic journals, most of the print subscriptions were switched to online only and new workflows were developed for e-journals.Staff learned new responsibilities such as activating e-journals, maintaining accurate holdings information in the online public access catalog and e-journals database ("electronic shelf reading"), updating the link resolver knowledgebase, and troubleshooting. All of the serials team members now spend significant amounts of time managing e-journals.The serials staff now spends its time managing the materials most important to the library's clientele (e-journals and databases). The team's proactive approach to maintenance work and rapid response to reported problems should improve patrons' experiences using e-journals. The library is taking advantage of new technologies such as an electronic resource management system, and library workflows and procedures will continue to evolve as technology changes.

AB  - Scholarly publishing, and scholarly communication more generally, are based on patterns established over many decades and even centuries. Some of these patterns are clearly valuable and intimately related to core values of the academy, but others were based on the exigencies of the past, and new opportunities have brought into question whether it makes sense to persist in supporting old models. New technologies and new publishing models raise the question of how we should fund and operate scholarly publishing and scholarly communication in the future, moving away from a scarcity model based on the exchange of physical goods that restricts access to scholarly literature unless a market-based exchange takes place. This essay describes emerging models that attempt to shift scholarly communication to a more open-access and mission-based approach and that try to retain control of scholarship by academics and the institutions and scholarly societies that support them. It explores changing practices for funding scholarly journals and changing services provided by academic libraries, changes instituted with the end goal of providing more access to more readers, stimulating new scholarship, and removing inefficiencies from a system ready for change.

AB  - Business models surrounding scholarly communications have been much debated over the past two decades. However, interest in the discussion has been sharpened in the UK by the funding issues facing the higher education sector, the reality of budget cuts and the need to focus on affordability. There is a growing realization that notions of ‘moderate’ price increases associated with ‘big deals’ over the past ten years will need to be radically reassessed.This paper discusses the financial realities facing UK libraries and the attempt by Research Libraries UK (RLUK) to look for solutions that maintain access to the maximum amount of material possible.

AB  - Abstract By analyzing 25,671 journals largely absent from common journal counts, as well as Web of Science and Scopus, this study demonstrates that scholarly communication is more of a global endeavor than is commonly credited. These journals, employing the open-source publishing platform Open Journal Systems (OJS), have published 5.8 million items; they are in 136 countries, with 79.9% in the Global South and 84.2% following the OA diamond model (charging neither reader nor author). A substantial proportion of journals operate in more than one language (48.3%), with research published in 60 languages (led by English, Indonesian, Spanish, and Portuguese). The journals are distributed across the social sciences (45.9%), STEM (40.3%), and the humanities (13.8%). For all their geographic, linguistic, and disciplinary diversity, 1.2% are indexed in the Web of Science and 5.7% in Scopus. On the other hand, 1.0% are found in Cabell’s Predatory Reports, and 1.4% show up in Beall’s (2021) questionable list. This paper seeks to both contribute to and historically situate the expanded scale and diversity of scholarly publishing in the hope that this recognition may assist humankind in taking full advantage of what is increasingly a global research enterprise.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the purpose, methods, and selected results of a study of faculty work practices, especially as they bear on the creation, location, and use of grey literature and the design and use of institutional repositories. Design/methodology/approach Based on a work‐practice study of faculty members and researchers at the University of Rochester. The methodology used videotaped interviews to record and analyze how participants accomplish such tasks as using web‐based research and writing tools, organizing books and papers, and staying current. Findings Reviews six key research findings related to the understandings and attitudes faculty members hold regarding institutional repositories and the role of librarians in developing institutional repository collections. Explains why librarians have found it difficult to attract faculty participation from the perspective of user needs and work practices. Research limitations/implications The study is based on field research with a small number of participants in six departments across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Access to faculty participants was limited. Practical implications Recommends new strategies for institutional repository design, recruitment of content, and outreach by librarians based on the six key research findings. Proposes an expanded role for librarians as liaisons to faculty who wish to share their work using the library's repository system. Originality/value The paper presents original research that addresses a current problem in the area of institutional repositories: why faculty members have not taken full advantage of new technologies that help them share their work. It lists the practical steps that librarians can take to improve faculty participation in repository projects and to increase access to grey literature for all scholars.

VL  - 48
AU  - Atkinson, Ross
C1  - Collections, Cornell University
AB  - Over the years since Library Resources and Technical Services began publication in 1957, many fine papers have appeared in the journal. From time to time, we will republish an important paper that contributed in a significant way to the theory of the field or that identified and addressed a unique problem. These papers will be published with a new introduction that revisits the themes of the original paper Acquisitions Librarian as Change Agent in the Transition to the Electronic Library, by Ross Atkinson, first appeared in 1992 (36, no. 1 [January 1992]: 7-20). This essay received the Best of LRTS Award for papers published in 1992. In it, Atkinson investigated the role of the librarian in handling new technology and proposed new functions and relationships for within the library. We have asked Atkinson to reconsider the ideas he explored in his original paper His new introduction proceeds the award-winning essay. --Editor The premise of this paper on the acquisitions librarian as change agent, originally presented in 1991, was that acquisitions, of all the major library functions, was arguably the least prepared for the transition to a primarily digital information environment. At the same time, however--so the argument went--acquisitions was uniquely positioned, because of its specialized business skills and experience, to lead the way in what we would later call reappropriation, that is, the academy's resumption of the responsibility for the publication or distribution of some or all of the scholarly information it produces. (Today, in the era of SPARC [Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition], High Wire Press, Project Muse, Project Euclid, E-Scholarship--just to name a few--the view that information services has a responsibility for the entire process of information exchange from the writer to the reader is self-evident; twelve years ago, however, it was still a relatively vague abstraction.) The paper suggested, therefore, that should make preparations to abandon its traditional operation and to assume a new role in the library and the academy as publication facilitator. I feel that someone else wrote this paper--because I was someone else in 1991--and I infer now that the person who wrote it was making three implicit assumptions: * Most scholarly publications would shift online relatively soon (the floodgates will open)--certainly well before the end of the 1990s. * In such a primarily online environment, the traditional function of would become increasingly superfluous. Only an accountant would really be needed, to pay the bills. * The whole process of scholarly communication, especially those areas that were dominated by commercial science publishers, was defective--and would likely collapse, sooner or later, of its own weight. It was important that the library be prepared, therefore, with alternative methods that scholars would be able to use to exchange information effectively. All three of these assumptions have obviously turned out to be entirely mistaken. While the writer of the paper acknowledged the conservative nature of the academy, he totally overestimated the speed with which the academic community would move to electronic publishing. I am sure he would have been shocked in 1991 to learn that over 80 percent of Cornell's materials budget in 2003 was still being spent on traditional materials. He would probably have been somewhat less surprised, although certainly disappointed, to learn that the real leadership in the transition to electronic scholarly publishing has been provided (admittedly with some notable exceptions) by commercial journal publishers--and that they have brilliantly contrived new methods (licensing, bundling) to increase their revenues in the online environment beyond even what they had managed to achieve in the era of print publishing. One (admittedly obvious) expectation in the paper that certainly has turned out to be true is that books would move much more slowly online than journals. …

AB  - Abstract After the closure of Jeffrey Beall’s open access “predatory” publishing blacklists in mid-January of 2017, a new “predatory publishing” blacklist emerged in 2018, Dolos list. This blacklist, curated by “Professor Alexandre Georges”, became defunct sometime in late 2020 or early 2021 based on publicly available clues. In this paper, several aspects of this blacklist, as retrieved from the Internet Archive and ResearchGate, were examined, including the profile of “Alexandre Georges”. The veracity of this individual’s identity is questioned. Discussion is provided about the citation, use and promotion of Dolos list in the literature and on websites as a solution and/or resource pertaining to “predatory” publishing. Given the questionable nature of the now-defunct Dolos blacklist website, and the uncertainty regarding the veracity of its curator’s identity, the author holds the opinion that sites that continue to promote the Dolos list may also be spreading inaccurate information (i.e., misinformation) to academics.

AB  - The lack of consistent training for scholarly authors, peer reviewers, and editors is a problem across disciplines, but it is one that affects academic librarians in a unique variety of ways. Like instructional faculty, academic librarians are generally required to engage in scholarly activity, but they are also increasingly in the position of providing guidance on and advocating for emerging trends in scholarly communication. This presentation will describe how the creation of a student-run journal and an associated scholarly communication course in Western University’s Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS) are helping to meet this need. L'absence d'une formation cohérente pour les auteurs, les évaluateurs et les éditeurs des communications savantes, est un problème dans toutes les disciplines de recherche, mais aussi un problème qui affecte les bibliothécaires universitaires de différentes manières. À l'instar des professeurs, les bibliothécaires universitaires sont généralement tenus de s'engager dans des activités savantes, mais ils se retrouvent aussi de plus en plus dans une position où ils doivent guider les chercheurs et leur fournir des conseils sur les tendances émergentes de la communication savante. Cette présentation décrira comment la création d'une revue dirigée par des étudiants et qu'un cours sur la communication savante dans la faculté d'information et des études des médias de la Western University peuvent contribuer à répondre à ces besoins.

AB  - More details on the financial model can be found in Section 3.6. Mission-Driven AlliancesUnderpinning our proposal is the belief that societies, colleges, universities, libraries, presses, and other scholarly institutions and organizations share a common mission to support the creation and distribution of research and scholarship to improve the lives of people and to help solve the world's most challenging problems.John Willinksy makes a particularly convincing case for OA along these lines in his book The Access Principle. 12Few question the societal benefit of providing wider access to research that could help citizens make informed decisions about their health care or enable a small business to innovate and help fuel the economy, but an equally compelling case can be made for providing access to political or policy research that improves the effectiveness of an NGO working in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or literary criticism on the works of Alice Munro or Edwidge Danticat that inspires students at an under-resourced high school.Restricting access to research benefits no one and runs counter to the stated mission of educational and not-forprofit institutions.While our proposed model admittedly challenges the traditional focus, work processes, and financial operations of our institutions, it also enables them to more fully achieve their mission.

AB  - Web-based platforms play an increasingly important role in managing and sharing research data of all types and sizes. This article presents a case study of the data storage, sharing, and management platform Figshare. We argue that such platforms are displacing and reconfiguring the infrastructure of norms, technologies, and institutions that underlies traditional scholarly communication. Using a theoretical framework that combines infrastructure studies with platform studies, we show that Figshare leverages the platform logic of core and complementary components to re-integrate a presently splintered scholarly infrastructure. By means of this logic, platforms may provide the path to bring data inside a scholarly communication system still optimized mainly for text publications. Yet the platform strategy also risks turning over critical scientific functions to private firms whose longevity, openness, and corporate goals remain uncertain. It may amplify the existing trend of splintering infrastructures, with attendant effects on equity of service.

AB  - The rise of digital repositories is helping libraries reinvent themselves. The benefits to libraries and universities creating institutional repositories (IRs) are great as libraries restructure, pursue collaborations, and re-position themselves to become major digital publishers and broadcasters in the scholarly world. They will no longer be passive receivers of information but active disseminators of intellectual output for entire universities. This article explores the IR's role in overall library transformation and examines the organizational changes and internal partnerships necessary to strengthen IR programs. Specifically, the creation of digital library initiatives units as well as changes to other library units are discussed.

AB  - Background Optimizing access to high-quality scientific journals has become an important priority for academic departments, including the ability to read the scientific literature and the ability to afford to publish papers in those journals. In this contribution, we assess the question of whether institutional investment in scientific journals aligns with the journals where researchers send their papers for publication, and where they serve as unpaid reviewers and editors. Methods We assembled a unique suite of information about the publishing habits of our Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, including summaries of 3,540 journal publications by 35 faculty members. These data include economic costs of journals to institutions and to authors, benefits to authors in terms of journal prestige and citation rates, and considerations of ease of reading access for individuals both inside and outside the university. This dataset included data on institutional costs, including subscription pricing (rarely visible to scholars), and “investment” by scholars in supporting journals, such as time spent as editors and reviewers. Results Our results highlighted the complex set of relationships between these factors, and showed that institutional costs often do not match well with payoffs in terms of benefits to researchers ( e.g. , citation rate, prestige of journal, ease of access). Overall, we advocate for greater cost-benefit transparency to help compare different journals and different journal business models; such transparency would help both researchers and their institutions in investing wisely the limited resources available to academics.

AB  - Although a case can be made for rewarding scientists for risky, novel science rather than for incremental, reliable science, novelty without reliability ceases to be science. The currently available evidence suggests that the most prestigious journals are no better at detecting unreliable science than other journals. In fact, some of the most convincing studies show a negative correlation, with the most prestigious journals publishing the least reliable science. With the credibility of science increasingly under siege, how much longer can we afford to reward novelty at the expense of reliability? Here, I argue for replacing the legacy journals with a modern information infrastructure that is governed by scholars. This infrastructure would allow renewed focus on scientific reliability, with improved sort, filter, and discovery functionalities, at massive cost savings. If these savings were invested in additional infrastructure for research data and scientific code and/or software, scientific reliability would receive additional support, and funding woes—for, e.g., biological databases—would be a concern of the past.

AB  - The scholarly community’s current definition of “open” captures only some of the attributes of openness that exist across different publishing models and content types. Open is not an end in itself, but a means for achieving the most effective dissemination of scholarship and research. We suggest that the different attributes of open exist along a broad spectrum and propose an alternative way of describing and evaluating openness based on four attributes: discoverable, accessible, reusable, and transparent. These four attributes of openness, taken together, form the draft “DART Framework for Open Access.” This framework can be applied to both research artifacts as well as research processes. We welcome input from the broader scholarly community about this framework.OSI2016 workgroup questionThere is a broad difference of opinion among the many stakeholders in scholarly publishing about how to precisely define open access publishing. Are “open access” and “open data” what we mean by open? Does “open” mean anything else? Does it mean “to make available,” or “to make freely available in a particular format?” Is a clearer definition needed (or maybe just better education on the current definition)? Why or why not? At present, some stakeholders see public access as being an acceptable stopping point in the move toward open access. Others see “open” as requiring free and immediate access with articles being available in CC-BY format. The range of opinions between these extremes is vast. How should these differences be decided? Who should decide? Is it possible to make binding recommendations (and how)? Is consensus necessary? What are the consequences of the lack of consensus?

AB  - The mechanisms used for scholarly publishing have remained largely unchanged over time, even as we’ve moved from a print-based world to a digital world. The scholarly communication ecosystem, however, is now undergoing a period of rapid transformation, including the introduction of new actors, new services, and increased pressure to improve the means of scholarly communication in order to meet the growing expectations of an information-rich world. Where to begin? The first question is to ask how scholarly publishing can provide the greatest benefit to global society in a sustainable way. Our two-day conversation about this question led us to the conclusion that the “black box,” monolithic model of scholarly publishing no longer serves most researchers. The most sustainable approach that best responds to the needs of authors and researchers today, and that may also pose the least amount of risk in completely disrupting the system, is disaggregated services—unbundling the products and services that publishers currently provide and letting market forces drive the development of, and demand for, a new and improved à la carte world of knowledge artifacts and knowledge management tools.OSI2016 Workshop QuestionWhat do we mean by publishing in today’s world? What should be the goals of scholarly publishing? What are the ideals to which scholarly publishing should aspire? What roles might scholarly publishers have in the future? What scenarios exist where publishers continue to play a vital role but information moves more freely? What impact might these reforms have on the health of publishers? Scholarly societies? Science research? Why?

AU  - Lowry, Charles
AB  - I consider it a "given" that the contribution of academic and research libraries was a central element in the success of the mission of higher education in the twentieth century. That premise leads to a difficult question—does it matter if libraries continue to be central in the century just beginning? Here I will make a second assumption—that it really does matter a great deal. At the risk of sounding pessimistic, it helps to understand the obstacles to re-positioning libraries successfully so that they may continue their vital contribution of providing access to scholarly information. These are largely beyond our immediate ability to remedy. That does not mean we should not try to understand them and to find the allies who can help us do the work of shaping the future of libraries—and there are many such allies. During the last two years, I have written closely allied pieces that have appeared in these pages exploring several topics that in my view are critical to the question of the future of libraries—on change, on the so-called "paradigm shift" and on intellectual property. In large measure, this essay is a capstone for all of them. 1

AB  - &lt;p class="3"&gt;This article provides an overview of the current state of repositories of open educational resources (ROER) in higher education at international level. It analyses a series of educational indicators to determine whether ROER can meet the specific needs of the education context, and to clarify understanding of the reuse of open educational resources (OER) provided by ROER. The aim of the study is to assess ROER by combining these two perspectives, and to form a basis for discussion among the universities that are responsible for these repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="3"&gt;The method was based on content analysis and consisted of two phases: an exploration of international sources, and an analysis of 110 ROER using the proposed set of indicators. The results focus on data from the analysis of ROER websites and some models of good practices. They are presented according to three core dimensions for evaluating ROER: general factors to establish types of ROER, a focus on drivers for OER reuse, and a focus on educational aspects. It was found that most of the ROER that included one or more of the proposed reuse indicators were created exclusively for educational resources. Educational aspects are not yet firmly embedded into ROER. The few repositories that seem to have successfully included them are those that provide other educational metadata and use educational standards.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Given the rapidly changing economics of scholarly communication in the digital age, the importance of accurate, specific data on the resource flows within this realm has become increasingly important.Both the producers and the collectors of scholarly information require accurate information in order to nimbly navigate their changing roles in advancing the progress of knowledge.Two key actors in this area are university presses and academic libraries, which both hold keystone roles in scholarly communications, as disseminators and conservators of scholarship, respectively.This paper describes an exploratory study examining one contentious aspect of the relationship between these two actors: trends in purchases of university press books by academic libraries.It does so in order to provide an empirical basis for evaluating frequent claims by publishers that declines in libraries' monographic purchasing over the past three decades can be held primarily responsible for the declining economic fortunes of university presses over the same period.The results of this analysis indicate that this relationship is not clear-cut, for at least two reasons: first, to the extent that purchasing reductions have occurred, they have occurred much more recently than prior accounts have suggested, and second, purchasing trends vary significantly between different libraries and between different sizes of university press.

AB  - This study analyzes research articles about open access (OA) indexed by the Scopus database, published from 2001 to 2015, in order to: (a) propose a categorization scheme about OA; (b) categorize the scientific production about OA; and (c) identify research trends on OA through disciplines at international level over time. The authors used descriptive statistical methods and deductive content analysis using an unconstrained matrix in 347 selected research articles. The most explored themes were found to be “overview, current state, and growth of OA” counting for 98 articles (28.2%), and “awareness, perceptions, and attitudes toward OA” for 75 articles (21.6%). As a conclusion, this study reveals a continuous and growing research interest by the OA community in studies focused on case studies regarding the development or evolution of OA in relation to certain groups, institutions, regions, periods, and how different actors perceive and address the OA movement.

AB  - Abstract In order to be able to provide thorough and timely coverage on the most recent scientific research, science journalists frequently rely on embargoed information sent to them by publishers of scientific journals. In such embargo e-mails, publishers purposefully bring selected upcoming releases to the journalists’ attention a few days in advance of their publication. Little is known on how this early highlighting of certain research articles affects their later citations or altmetrics. We present an exploratory case study with the aim of assessing the effects of such promotion activities on scientific articles’ bibliometric and altmetric indicators. In a treatment–control design, we analyze citation counts and eight types of altmetrics of 715 articles published between 2016 and 2017 whose DOIs have been mentioned in embargo e-mails and compare these to articles from the same journal issues that have not been highlighted in embargo e-mails. Descriptive statistics and Mann–Whitney-U tests reveal significant advantages for promoted articles across all regarded metrics three to four years after their publication. Particularly large differences can be seen regarding numbers of mentions in mainstream media, in blogs, on Twitter, and on Facebook. Our findings suggest that scholarly publishers exert significant influence over which research articles will receive attention and visibility in various (social) media. Also, regarding utilizations of metrics for evaluative purposes, the observed effects of promotional activities on indicators might constitute a factor of undesirable influence that currently does not receive the amount of consideration in scientometric assessments that it should receive.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to give a macro-picture of collaboration in research groups and networks across all academic fields in Norwegian research universities, and to examine the relative importance of membership in groups and networks for individual publication output. To our knowledge, this is a new approach, which may provide valuable information on collaborative patterns in a particular national system, but of clear relevance to other national university systems. At the system level, conducting research in groups and networks are equally important, but there are large differences between academic fields. The research group is clearly most important in the field of medicine and health, while undertaking research in an international network is most important in the natural sciences. Membership in a research group and active participation in international networks are likely to enhance publication productivity and the quality of research.

AB  - Abstract The IUPAC centenary in 2019 is fast approaching, and this will naturally lead people to look back at the significant achievements of the organisation and its dedicated volunteers over the past one hundred years. Equally important, however, will be the need to look forward to the roles for IUPAC in its second century. This special issue of Chemistry International (CI) could well feature in that assessment, as technology in the digital age, and particularly the data that technology produces, will clearly be an essential tool for the future of chemistry as a discipline.

AB  - Purpose/Thesis: This paper attempts to present the trends in management and opening of research data in Poland and the European Union, based on the analysis of the recently published Polish and European acts and documents as well as of other international initiatives which might influence scholarly publishing and scholarly communication.Approach/Methods: An in-depth review of the latest documents was applied. Results and conclusions: I focused on highlighting the key elements of the reviewed documents and initiatives, highlighting the directions for managing and opening of research data they set and the implications they might have for Polish and European science. I also sketched the possible inconsisten­cies between the European and Polish policies related to research data and scholarly communication.Research limitations: The documents investigated for the purpose of this paper were either Polish or provided by the European Union (EU). I have not analyzed the national documents issued by the individual member states of the EU other than Poland. Hence, it is probable that some solutions on research data management and opening already taken on the level of individual member states have not been included in this paper.Practical implications: This paper may encourage a reflection on the relationship between the regulations issued at the European (EU) or at the national (in this case, Polish), and the practices and requirements of scholarly communication which often contradict those regulations.Originality/Value: This is the first analysis of the latest Polish and European documents and initiatives as related to data management and open data (open science).

AB  - &#x0D; This case study critically examines ongoing developments in contemporary scholarship through the lens of research data management support at KU Leuven, and KU Leuven Libraries in particular. By means of case-based examples, current initiatives for fostering sound scientific work and scholarship are considered in three associated domains: support for policy-making, the development of research infrastructures, and digital literacy training for students, scientists and scholars. It is outlined how KU Leuven Libraries collaborates with partner services in order to contribute to KU Leuven’s research data management support network. Particular attention is devoted to the innovations that facilitate such collaborations. These accounts of initial experiences form the basis for a reflection on best practices and pitfalls, and foreground a number of pertinent challenges facing the domain of research data management, including matters of scalability, technology acceptance and adoption, and methods for effectively gauging and communicating the manifold transformations of science and scholarship.&#x0D;

AB  - Watch the VIDEO.The Swedish government has expressed an intention to move towards open access (OA) to publications based on publicly funded research in Sweden. As part of fulfilling this intention, the Bibsam Consortium, working on behalf of a number of Swedish universities, government agencies, and research institutes, has started to include OA in their negotiations with publishers. One consequence is that Bibsam has followed other international actors and entered into a number of offset agreements. The first of these agreements was Springer Compact, which runs from July 2016 to December 2018. The implementation and consequences of this agreement are being investigated at the request of Bibsam, and this presentation builds on findings from this investigation.Offset agreements are presented as one possible road ahead, a temporary one, in the transition towards OA to scholarly publications. A number of factors, including costs and the speed of flipping hybrid journals to full OA, will determine the success of such agreements. The attitudes of the researchers – the authors of the publications – are also key in determining the outcome. This presentation reports on findings from a questionnaire submitted by 375 first authors of articles covered by the Swedish Springer Compact agreement. It will present the authors’ attitudes to OA, to the Springer Compact agreement, and to future similar agreements.The study shows that only about one quarter of respondents knew about the agreement before submitting their work. A majority would not have paid article processing charges (APC) for their article had APCs not been covered by the agreement. Many are generally positive to OA publishing, however. When asked what they think about agreements such as Springer Compact, three quarters wrote in free-text answers that it is “good”, “very good” or “excellent”. Respondents express both appreciation of the easy process and a relief over not having to find funding for OA.Some respondents were more tentative, saying that they appreciate OA, but that their opinion about the agreement depends on the cost. Non-profit solutions to academic publishing or alternative methods to achieving OA were also mentioned as desirable. A small number of respondents would prefer the traditional subscription model. Yet, the vast majority of respondents say they would like to see similar agreements with other publishers.The answers to the questionnaire show that these researchers are very positive to having their work published OA if it is not associated with costs, limitations, or other hassles for the researcher. That is, if publishing remains no more problematic than in the subscription system, researchers see many benefits with OA. However, there is a minority which expresses ideological hesitation. From this, universities and funders can learn the value of facilitating OA publishing for the individual researcher, but also that many researchers will expect agreements to be economically feasible and that there is a potential to engaging researchers even more in the discussion of future solutions.

AB  - This article analyzes researchers’ adoption of an institutional central fund (or faculty publication fund) for open-access (OA) article-processing charges (APCs) to contribute to a wider understanding of take-up of OA journal publishing (“Gold” OA). Quantitative data, recording central fund usage at the University of Nottingham from 2006 to 2014, are analyzed alongside qualitative data from institutional documentation. The importance of the settings of U.K. national policy developments and international OA adoption trends are considered. Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) is used as an explanatory framework. It is shown that use of the central fund grew during the period from covering less than 1% of the University’s outputs to more than 12%. Health and Life Sciences disciplines made greatest use of the fund. Although highly variable, average APC prices rose during the period, with fully OA publishers setting lower average APCs. APCs were paid largely from internal funds, but external funding became increasingly important. Key factors in adoption are identified to be increasing awareness and changing perceptions of OA, communication, disciplinary differences, and adoption mandates. The study provides a detailed longitudinal analysis of one of the earliest central funds to be established globally with a theoretically informed explanatory model to inform future work on managing central funds and developing institutional and national OA policies.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to report on the findings of the second phase of the Behavioural strand of the EC‐funded PEER project ( http://www.peerproject.eu/ ). The paper seeks to explore authors' and readers' behaviours in relation to authors' peer‐reviewed accepted manuscripts in open access repositories. Design/methodology/approach The research was undertaken using a mixed‐method approach, involving the distribution of a survey by the 12 participating publishers to their authors in selected journal titles and a participatory workshop with European researchers from selected disciplinary areas. Findings Researchers' attitudes towards versions of published journal articles made open access via open access repositories may vary depending on whether researchers report behaviours from the perspective of an author or a reader. The research found that disciplinary cultures, norms and traditions shape authors' self‐archiving behaviour and readers' use of those versions of journal articles held in repositories. Research limitations/implications One of the limitations of the research is that it was impossible for the research team to gauge the representativeness of the survey compared to the actual disciplinary distribution of the population of EU researchers, as such population information is not available in an aggregated and consistent format. Originality/value The PEER Observatory is an unprecedented large‐scale collaboration between publishers, researchers and repositories to investigate the effects of self‐archiving at European level. The paper provides a disciplinary reading of the findings and augments the understanding of how disciplinary culture and norms shape authors' and readers' behaviours in relation to self‐archiving.

AB  - Objective – This study investigated researchers’ perceptions of open access publishing and the ways in which the university’s open access subvention fund could evolve to meet the campus community’s needs. Methods – In spring 2021, two librarians conducted an anonymous survey using a convenience sample to recruit participants. The survey was directly distributed to 113 University of Idaho (U of I) affiliates who had received funding from, or expressed interest in, the open access subvention fund during the previous three years (FY 2019 to FY 2021). Other U of I affiliates were also offered the opportunity to participate in the survey via a link shared in the U of I’s daily email newsletter as well across the U of I’s graduate student email list. The researchers received 42 usable survey responses. The survey included 26 closed and open-ended questions and analysis included cross-tabulations based on fund applicant status as well as respondent role. Of the 26 questions, 4 were modified from a colleague’s previous study with U of I faculty members (Gaines, 2015). Results – Survey responses showed that interest in and support for open access were common among respondents. Although a majority of respondents had published an open access journal article and would like to continue to publish open access in the future, only 17% agreed that they had departmental support to do so. Results also demonstrated that researchers were less willing to pay article processing charges (APCs) out-of-pocket and preferred for funding to come from grant budgets first, followed by Office of Research Budgets, department or college budgets, and library budgets. Respondents expressed support for many of the open access subvention fund’s current criteria and processes, but they also indicated an interest in establishing a more equitable fund distribution cycle and allowing researchers to seek pre-approval once their article was accepted for peer-review. Findings related to open access publishing perspectives built upon previous research conducted at the U of I (Gaines, 2015) and across other institutions. Conclusion – This study confirmed the importance of evaluating and assessing library programs and services to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of campus communities. Through the study results, the researchers demonstrated that respondents were interested in open access publishing and the continuation of the open access subvention fund, as well as offering the U of I an opportunity to adjust the open access subvention fund’s processes to better serve researchers. These results also highlighted the need for those involved in open access publishing support to investigate new open access advocacy and education efforts to ensure that researchers receive the philosophical and financial support they need to pursue different models of scholarly publishing.

AB  - This research explored the awareness, usage and perspectives of Tanzanian researchers on open access as a mode of scholarly communication. A survey questionnaire targeted 544 respondents selected through stratified random sampling from a population of 1088 university researchers of the six public universities in Tanzania. With a response rate of 73%, the data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. The study reveals that the majority of the researchers were aware of and were positive towards open access. Findings further indicate that the majority of researchers in Tanzanian public universities used open access outlets more to access scholarly content than to disseminate their own research findings. It seems that most of these researchers would support open access publishing more if issues of recognition, quality and ownership were resolved. Thus many of them supported the idea of establishing institutional repositories at their respective universities as a way of improving the dissemination of local content. The study recommends that public universities and other research institutions in the country should consider establishing institutional repositories, with appropriate quality assurance measures, to improve the dissemination of research output emanating from these institutions.

AB  - Social networking sites can seem frivolous and pointless to academics, but specialized academic social networking sites are gaining popularity in certain disciplines and with certain faculty.These academic social networks were briefly discussed in a previous column, as was the new intersection between social media and scholarly publishing, but academic social networks are an interesting online space that merit their own discussion (Ovadia 2013).This column looks at ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net) and Academia.edu,two of the more popular academic social networks.Social networking functionality is increasingly common in all kinds of tools, though.Citation management products, like Mendeley, Zotero, and CiteU-Like, in addition to managing citations for users, also have social media features, allowing users to find and follow each other.However, those three tools are primarily citation managers that also have social networking functionality.ResearchGate and Academia.eduare primarily social networking sites.Online social networks exist along a continuum.Something like Facebook, while used for a multitude of purposes, is probably most frequently used for informal communication between friends of some degree.Something like LinkedIn is used for professional communication and career networking.Academic social networks are even more specific, catering to those associated with academic institutions and specializing in academic activities like sharing papers and data sets.They also provide publication analytics and facilitate the exchange of information.Both ResearchGate and Academia.eduallow users to post public questions to the community, much like Quora, another online question-and-answer site.Both networks group users by

AB  - Abstract The panel will discuss the importance of understanding the research environment for providing effective information and technology support to researchers, and the implications for curricula in professional education. Our specific context is growing involvement of academic libraries and information services in managing research data, but the issues raised have wider implications for educating and developing other information specialists (e.g., in research institutes, government agencies, public libraries). Studies in the past five years have identified technical and discipline‐related skills and knowledge gaps as potential constraints on developing library research data services. Our recent research in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Ireland confirmed the need for data curation and technology skills, but also found practitioners engaging in other forms of research support, and expressing needs for a multilayered introduction to the research environment, extending beyond the research skills typically gained in masters programs, including subjects such as academic culture and practice, and research policy and evaluation. The panelists represent a mix of academic and practitioner viewpoints from different countries. They will each offer their views on what is missing and should be added to graduate curricula, and how programs can make space, asking the audience to respond with their own suggestions, counter‐arguments, and alternative visions, using an interactive style from the start.

AB  - This article focuses on the construction of open mobile knowledge base (OMKB) in higher vocational colleges (HVCs), and adopts the methodologies of documental analysis, questionnaires, surveys and case studies to analyze OMKB in HVCs in China. Then, through the analysis of domestic and foreign data, it can be seen that the current storage volume of knowledge base of scientific research results in Chinese universities is far below the level of western developed countries. Conducting the construction of OMKB in HVCs can better comply with the trend of social development, meet the knowledge needs of the public, and form the complementarity between different institutions. However, in reality, there are still some problems and deficiencies in the OMKB service mode of HVCs, which emphasize information collection rather than knowledge application, paper literature rather than electronic data, on-campus service rather than social service, and existing knowledge rather than creative consciousness. Therefore, on the basis of full investigation and analysis, this paper proposes that the optimization path of the OMKB service mode in China›s HVCs is: exploring the joint mode of cooperation between universities and society, and operation and management, improving the system platform and funding sources, and making good storage and sharing of resources. The innovation of the OMKB service mode of HVCs in China can achieve the following: carrying out innovation and improvement, laying social foundation, promoting innovation of resource evaluation system, protecting the innovation of intellectual property mode, co-construction of the HVCs’ alliance knowledge base system innovation, technological innovation, - applying the advanced technology of CRIS, helping China’s HVCs’ knowledge base construction transformation and upgrading.

AB  - Abstract The Academy of Finland (AKA), Finland’s major public research funding agency, uses a Web of Science (WoS) based bibliometric indicator to assess the performance of research it has funded. We use an alternative methodology to compare (1) the research performance and (2) the scholarly communication profile of AKA-funded research to the Finnish universities’ entire output across the major fields of arts and sciences. Our data consists of 142,742 publications (years 2015–2018) registered in the national information service, which integrates Current Research Information System (CRIS) data of 13 Finnish universities. Research performance is analyzed using the Finnish community-curated expert-based rating of publication channels (so-called JUFO). Our results show that compared to the Finnish universities’ entire output a larger share of AKA-funded research is published in leading JUFO rated journals and book publishers. JUFO and WoS-based indicators produced consonant results regarding the performance of AKA-funded research. Analysis of publication profiles shows that AKA-funded research is more focused than the universities’ output on using peer-reviewed publications, articles published in journals, English language, foreign publishers and open access publishing. We conclude that the CRIS-based publication data can support multidimensional assessments of research performance and scholarly communication profiles, potentially also in other countries and institutions. CRIS development and maintenance require multi-stakeholder commitment, resources and incentives to ensure data quality and coverage. To fully recognize diverse open science practices and to enable international comparisons, CRISs need further development and integration as data sources.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper examines changing research practices in the digital environment. A review of the literature and our own field research in Australia suggest that there is a new mode of knowledge production emerging, changing research practices and bringing new information access and dissemination needs. Adjustments will be required to accommodate these changes, but new opportunities are emerging for more cost‐effective and sustainable information access and dissemination. It will be necessary, however, to take an holistic approach and treat the creation, production and distribution of scholarly information, the management of information rights and access, systems of review and evaluation and the underlying infrastructure as parts of a single research information and scholarly communication system.

AB  - This article investigates the potential role for research students in an institutional repository (IR). Face-to-face interviews with 34 research students at Loughborough University were carried out. Using a mixture of closed and open questions, the interviews explored the students’ experiences and opinions of publishing, open access and the proposed Loughborough repository. As both authors and readers, students were most interested in access to complete theses, postprints and conference papers. The ability to disseminate their work and to receive feedback and commentary were the most important motivators to students depositing work in the IR, closely followed by the principle of open access. The greatest deterrents were the risk of being unable to publish elsewhere later, the ownership of copyright and plagiarism. Appropriate recommendations are made for the implementation of an institutional repository.

AB  - Researcher-facing librarians in New Zealand are providing guidance across more of the research lifecycle than ever before in response to an increasingly complex scholarly ecosystem. This research explored the development of research support through survey responses from all eight New Zealand University Libraries. From the responses it was possible to ascertain the level of services offered or planned in the four key areas of research impact, Research Data Management, scholarly communication and Kaupapa Māori research. Skills gaps and barriers to service development were also identified. Comparison with an earlier study revealed that research impact and Research Data Management services have developed well over the last 6 years. A good level of maturity was identified in scholarly communication services but support for Kaupapa Māori research was identified as an area for development. Barriers to service development included lack of resourcing and low recognition of library value from the wider institution.

AB  - Several studies have highlighted the critical role of academic digital libraries in providing research support services and improving research performance. Although several studies have discussed the value of realizing this role, a business model that can serve as a reference in carrying out this role is not yet available. This research aimed to propose a business model and a prototype design for Indonesia’s academic digital library for research support services. A focus group discussion was conducted involving nine experts to identify the key factors. They were then mapped onto a Business Model Canvas. The key activities in the business model guided the requirements gathering for developing a prototype. The requirements were obtained from the literature reviews with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The requirements were validated by interviewing library managers, research unit managers, and information technology managers. This research resulted in the academic digital library Business Model Canvas and the proposed prototype design, which consisted of a mobile application for member users and a back-office application to manage services by librarians. Further research on prototype implementation testing and the development of a successful implementation model is needed to strengthen this research.

This paper analyzes the present serials acquisitions crisis as the latest manifestation of the instability of the economic system supporting scholarly communication, which places an increasingly intolerable burden on the research library. It reviews various solutions that have been proposed to solve this crisis, arguing that none is achievable as long as the present economic system continues. It proposes a resolution to this dilemma, drawing upon the capabilities of new electronic technology, through which the economic burden on the research library will be reduced or even eliminated, and the system of scholarly communication improved.

AB  - Predatory publishing represents a major challenge to scholarly communication. This paper maps the infiltration of journals suspected of predatory practices into the citation database Scopus and examines cross-country differences in the propensity of scholars to publish in such journals. Using the names of "potential, possible, or probable" predatory journals and publishers on Beall's lists, we derived the ISSNs of 3,293 journals from Ulrichsweb and searched Scopus with them. 324 of journals that appear both in Beall's lists and Scopus with 164 thousand articles published over 2015-2017 were identified. Analysis of data for 172 countries in 4 fields of research indicates that there is a remarkable heterogeneity. In the most affected countries, including Kazakhstan and Indonesia, around 17% of articles fall into the predatory category, while some other countries have no predatory articles whatsoever. Countries with large research sectors at the medium level of economic development, especially in Asia and North Africa, tend to be most susceptible to predatory publishing. Arab, oil-rich and/or eastern countries also appear to be particularly vulnerable. Policymakers and stakeholders in these and other developing countries need to pay more attention to the quality of research evaluation.The online version contains supplementary material available at (10.1007/s11192-020-03852-4).

AB  - Academic institutions around the United States are facing pressure to reduce tuition and fees in order to keep higher education accessible. Open Education Resource (OER) is one attempt by academic institutions to provide high quality education resources at a lower cost to students, by replacing traditional textbooks with freely available or low cost materials. Libraries as information experts play an active role in the implementation of OER. This article looks at the current state of OER and what potential impacts OER will have on libraries.

AB  - Understanding Knowledge as a Commons: From Theory to Practice edited by Charlotte Hess and Elinor Ostrom. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2007. 320 pp. ISBN 0-262-08357-4. In Binta y la Gran Idea (Manso, 2004), a warmhearted short film nominated at the 79th Academy Awards, the main character, Agnile, a local fisherman from a small village in Senegal, learns from a friend that most modern fishing equipment used in Europe allows you to catch in one day, more fish than you could eat in your whole life. Puzzled by this finding, Agnile humbly writes to the local government: “if we follow the path shown to us by the First World, we risk that the children of our children will have no fish, no trees, no air...” The preoccupation of Agnile - the dissipation of a common good due to its over- exploitation by groups and individuals pursuing their best interest - is the tragedy of the commons. This theory, memorably depicted by Garrett Hardin (Hardin, 1968), is the thread that conceptually ties together the chapters of Understanding knowledge as a commons: From theory to practice, a collection of essays edited by Charlotte Hess and Elinor Ostrom. Contributors to this book include leading scholars in domains such as intellectual property, open source software, electronic publishing, digital preservation and civic engagement. Their essays present an analysis of the knowledge commons from their particular perspectives and in relation to Hardin's tragedy. The book is divided into three sections: the study of the knowledge commons, their protection, and their production. What are knowledge commons? In the first section of the book, Hess and Ostrom provide a very thorough introduction and analysis of the concept of knowledge as a commons, appropriate for readers of all levels of familiarity with this field. Remarkably, they collocate the notion of knowledge in the context of more tangible realms, such as oceans and forests, which have traditionally been regarded as common-pool resources. Their analysis, however, tends to capture communities and their knowledge generation mechanisms in too great detail - something that risks undermining the very open-ended nature of the knowledge commons. For example, their diagnostic study tool (the Institutional Analysis and Development framework) primarily takes into account traditional scholarly communication channels, not leaving enough space for novel forms of collaborative knowledge generation and dissemination. However, with David Bollier's contribution (The Growth of the Commons Paradigm), the concept of knowledge commons is reformulated, in particular with respect to its most recent evolution. Bollier does a thorough job of presenting a new cultural form of

ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack CitationsPermissions ShareFacebookTwitterLinked InMendeleyWechatReddit Figures & Info The driving force behind most scientists' careers is to achieve the maximum visibility for their research. Since the creation of the first scientific journals in the mid-seventeenth century, scientists have condensed their data and conclusions into a manuscript and happily handed this over to a publisher, who in return has printed it and distributed it to those willing—or whose institutes are willing—to pay a subscription fee. But the triple whammy of rising journal prices, an exploding number of journals and imploding library budgets means that the bulk of this work can now only be accessed by a small fraction of its intended audience. The arrival of the World Wide Web has the potential to change this reality: now that the vast majority of printed articles are also available in an electronic form, which is theoretically accessible by anyone with an interest and an internet connection, shouldn't all articles become free for everyone to read? …publishing is still operating largely on an economic model that evolved when there were fewer journals, available only in print This reasoning has spawned the ‘open-access’ model of publishing, which has been proclaimed as a revolution in science and was the main focus of an EMBL/EMBO-organized meeting entitled ‘Science Publishing at the Crossroads’, held on 7 June 2003 at the Print Media Academy in Heidelberg, Germany. Technological advances now enable wider access to scientific literature with no associated distribution costs, but publishing is still operating largely on an economic model that evolved when there were fewer journals, available only in print. Jean-Claude Guédon, a science historian from the University of Montreal, Canada, concluded his overview of science publishing by saying, “The beauty of science is that it has been the first operational example of how humanity can create a system of distributed intelligence. Right now it's not working in the best possible way with regard to communication. We haven't scaled up so well.” Around 28,000 scientific periodicals exist at present, and the market for these is incredibly inelastic; most journals and the articles published in them are monopolies, and there is no market correction of prices as a result of competition. If you need an article published in journal X, a subscription to journal Y is of no use. In the 1960s, commercial publishers realized the potential profit to be made in disseminating information, and through their launch of new journals and their control of the core, traditional titles, they have since held a firm grip on scientific communication and the evaluation of scientists. Journal prices have risen dramatically—an institutional subscription to a bundle of seven titles including Brain Research, for example, is US $20,000 a year—and publishers are being accused of reaping extortionate profits. Guédon asked, “Is this optimal? Is this the best way to do things for the scientific community?” His answer: no. “Only the wealthiest institutions from the wealthiest countries can afford these things. Brains are being wasted.” In response to this, a number of new initiatives aim to provide everyone in the scientific community and interested members of the public with access to what are, after all, the results of publicly funded research. These include the commercial venture BioMedCentral, which at present publishes 90 open-access journals, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), the Joint Information Systems Committee and the Open Society Institute, whose meeting in December 2001 gave rise to the Budapest Open Access Initiative that brought the open-access movement to the forefront. One of the most high-profile organizations, however, is the not-for-profit Public Library of Science (PLoS), co-founded by Harold Varmus, then director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), Pat Brown from the Stanford University of Medicine (CA, USA) and Michael Eisen from the University of California at Berkeley, USA. At the meeting Eisen explained, “It's easy to envisage a day when there will be ‘Public Libraries of Science’ where anybody can go and browse the scientific literature. What we're trying to address is why this obvious common good has not become a reality.” “We are not just another Nature, Science or Cell. We are morally superior and what we are doing is better for the future of science.” The current generation of scientists is much more familiar with PubMed and Google than the contents of their library shelves, so it is common for them to stumble across abstracts of articles relevant to their research in journals that would otherwise be outside their core reading. And if their library does not have a subscription to this journal, this not only causes frustration but also inhibits research. The life sciences are now extremely data-driven and a great deal of information needs to be integrated from studies at many different levels: molecular, cellular, organismal and environmental. For progress to be made, this information needs to be freely accessible. Eisen compared the current restrictions on the literature with that of DNA databases such as GenBank. “It is insane that the data itself is made available but the methods that I used and the conclusions that I drew from it are not.” Furthermore, he feels that the greatest opportunity that is being wasted is that of enabling scientists to find new and creative ways to use and integrate the literature, which we cannot yet envisage. Eisen said, “We are not just another Nature, Science or Cell. We are morally superior and what we are doing is better for the future of science.” In this current backlash against what are portrayed as greedy, money-grabbing commercial publishers, Elsevier is bearing the brunt of the mudslinging—with more than 1,700 titles and pre-tax profits for 2002 of around €1.5 billion, they are an obvious target. Varmus recently gave an interview to the German newspaper Die Zeit, and at the mention of Elsevier exclaimed, “That's the devil!” However, at the meeting, Elsevier's then chief executive, Derk Haank, strongly defended his company's position and outlined the benefits that will come from their transition to electronic publishing. Elsevier have so far digitized 4.4 million scientific articles and aim to have all 8 million articles on the web by the end of next year for all their subscribers to access. “Our end goal is that we want the whole world to have access to our material 24 hours a day with no additional charges to the end user. That is also open access, but it's paid for by the librarian.” Haank also outlined their differential pricing scheme, which should make this information accessible to most institutions—those in developing countries have free access, those in intermediate countries and small institutions in the developed world are charged a reduced fee, and only the wealthy, large institutions pay the full subscription. “The important thing to remember is that even in electronic publishing, the costs don't go away. Somebody has to pay,” he said. Indeed, the costs of publishing can be significant. A professional editorial office to oversee the reviewing process, editing, and conversion of material to an electronic format are arguably dispensable, but do add to the quality and readability of the final article. Furthermore, Haank noted, “In our experience with electronic publishing, the costs don't go down, they go up. We have to invest in search machines, databases and archiving.” Unrestricted access to the literature appears to be a common end-goal, but given the inescapable costs and the proposed lack of subscription revenue, the question is: who pays? In the open-access model, journals will recoup costs by charging for the service they provide to authors, rather than for content. The original tactic of the PLoS was to convert existing publishers to an open-access model by calling for a boycott of those that operated under a closed-access policy, but this had little effect. “We've spent far too long hammering on the publishers' doors and telling them that they need to change, but the publishers will only change when we make them change,” said Eisen. It was this realization that prompted PLoS to launch two new journals, PLoS Biology and PLoS Medicine, in December 2002, with a US $9 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The journals' contents will be freely available on the web and the first edition of PLoS Biology is planned for October 2003. Their business model is to charge authors to publish—US $1,500 per paper is the current estimate—or to charge institutions a subscription fee, which allows any of their researchers to subsequently publish free of charge. The NIH, Cancer Research UK and all the UK's universities are among the 250 institutions that have signed up so far. “The important thing to remember is that even in electronic publishing, the costs don't go away. Somebody has to pay” The original ‘author pays’ concept is already being refined to a ‘system pays’ model, which works on the principle that the money for subscriptions comes from scientists' grants when their institution takes its percentage to fund its library. This money simply needs to be rechannelled, Eisen said. “The question isn't really who pays, it is how we pay. We should view the costs of publication as fundamental costs of doing the research in the first place. They are the last small but critical piece of money we spend as part of the research process. What could be more fundamental than communicating your results to the rest of the community and the public?” In response to this, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute has allocated part of their grants specifically for publication fees, and other funding bodies, such as the NIH, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust, have endorsed this model. Eisen commented “We have given the scientific community this opportunity and now the real question is will the scientific community respond in the way that it should?” But even though these competing open-access journals have been created, the scientists' shift to publishing in them is likely to be slow, most crucially because of the career structures that are in place at present. As long as scientists rely on publishing in high-impact journals to secure funding, there is no incentive to switch to new, open-access models. There needs, therefore, to be changes in the way grant-awarding bodies assess performance and in the attitudes of scientists who reinforce the system by aiming to publish only in prestigious journals. In the meantime, however, Frank Gannon, executive director of the EMBO and a senior group leader at the EMBL, warned that “PhD students have their career to make and should not be sacrificed on some altar of idealism.” Furthermore, moving from a subscription-based model may not necessarily suit all journals. There is a high demand for secondary information in the form of reviews and analyses that distill primary data into time-efficient summaries, but journals that feature such articles are particularly labour-intensive and would find it difficult to recoup their costs under the proposed system. Indeed, the only way that journals may be able to protect their subscriptions is by providing content that readers are willing to purchase, possibly in the form of on-line ‘knowledge environments’ on specific topics of research. Society journals may also find it difficult to move to an open-access model because they rely on the profit from subscriptions to fund other activities. Once the costs of publishing become more transparent, societies will need to find other ways of fundraising to support, for example, their fellowship schemes and conferences. Conversely, open access is more in line with the mission of societies, in that it maximizes the visibility of research in their field. Sally Morris, secretary general of the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers, said: “There is a lot of interest in the model […] Society journals are realising that maybe it would be better for their communities.” Some journals, including those published by the Company of Biologists and the Society of Endocrinology, are seriously considering moving to the hybrid economic model proposed by David Prosser from SPARC. In what will be an interesting experiment, articles will be available only to subscribers unless the author chooses to pay, in which case they will be freely available on the web. This should demonstrate in the short term whether there is a willingness to pay, and in the longer term whether open access does indeed create increased visibility, and thus citations. “This way there's no risk [for the journals],” said Morris. …even though these competing open-access journals have been created, the scientists' shift to publishing in them is likely to be slow, most crucially because of the career structures that are in place at present Many journals will await the outcome of these trials before committing themselves to open access, particularly given that there are still many question marks over the economics of the model. The true costs will not be apparent for some time as PLoS is at present subsidized by grants, so their eventual author charge is not certain. Also, should journals with high rejection rates pass on all their editorial costs to the authors of accepted papers, or also charge an initial submission fee? The latter is likely to be strongly resisted, as authors already invest significant amounts of time and emotion in each submission without also paying for the experience. If space is unrestricted and economics rule, what is the disincentive for the lower-impact journals to increase their returns by lowering the rejection rate? The result could be an increase in the quantity of scientific articles at the expense of quality. Guédon also speculated that a new market could develop, such that journals are not only competing on impact factors, but also on price. “Will you pay $1,500 to PLoS or will you pay $7,000 to another publisher given that the money will buy you this branding or that branding? At that point, the battle really starts.” And if the institutions that suffer the most under the current subscription model are the poorer ones, nothing will change for them under the open-access model. PLoS will waive the fee for researchers from developing countries, but those from institutions that do not quite qualify may be excluded from publishing for financial reasons. Gannon said, “We'll be back with another moral dilemma. We have to make countries recognize that it is a tremendously positive investment for them to make the money available such that articles can be published freely.” …an overhaul of the system is perhaps a more complex task than it first appeared when PLoS emerged with their battle cries of revolution The concept of open-access publishing and the clear benefits that it holds for science are not in debate, but an overhaul of the system is perhaps a more complex task than it first appeared when PLoS emerged with their battle cries of revolution. Many parties have a role to play in the transition, including publishers, funding bodies, societies and of course scientists. At the same time, changes are taking place in the publishing world to improve accessibility without a full-scale break with the systems that are already in place. Journals are being made free to those in the developing world, and many journals are making their content free on the web after a delay of 6–12 months. For some journals, authors now retain the copyright of their work and grant the publishers a ‘license to publish’. Differential pricing, as highlighted by Haank, is also important for disseminating information in a more fair and democratic manner. Even if the revolution does not materialize, it will no doubt speed up the evolution of the current pay-per-access model; it is therefore worth taking the time now to work out a system that is optimal. “These new initiatives do have an impact on established parties. I hope that we will indeed move towards [open access] through evolution,” Haank concluded. “The only thing that I object to is people destroying what is good about the old system for the sake of destroying it. Let's all move [forward] together.” Previous ArticleNext Article Volume 4Issue 81 August 2003In this issue RelatedDetailsLoading ...

AB  - A discussion on SPARC Europe's report Opening Knowledge: Retaining Rights and Open Licensing in Europe (made public via Zenodo, 28 June 2023). Three of the authors of the report share their thoughts on why the landscape differs so much between countries. Questions include why so many institutions in the United Kingdom and Norway stand out as early adopters, whereas other countries have yet to start implementing Rights Retention Policies, be it a national or institutional level. Various outreach and dissemination activities are on-going, and there appears to be promising developments in several European countries that might radically change the landscape for open licensing and self-archiving across Europe, thereby speeding up the transformation towards full open access to the scholarly record. The recording was made in conjunction with the 18th Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing in Tromsø, November 2023. First published online: January 23, 2024.

TI  - Rise of the predators: Business is booming in the murky global market of suspect and sham publishers and journals
IS  - 4
VL  - 124
AU  - Nelson, Bryn
AB  - This is Part 1 of a 3-part series on the origins, impacts, and opponents of predatory journals. One Russian-owned journal that may or may not be based in Warsaw, Poland, appears to have a fake editorial board and a bogus impact factor. Another publisher and prolifi c spammer with a posted address in Wilmington, Delaware, but a more likely base in Hyderabad, India, has closely copied the scope and aims of legitimate medical journals published by Amsterdam-based Elsevier. A third publishing company based in Delhi, India, recently launched with 61 journal titles. The only journal with articles published as of mid-February falsely claimed to be a member of the respected Committee on Publication Ethics and included 4 articles and a review, all coauthored by its editor-in-chief. The Scholarly Open Access blog, fueled by tips from readers around the world, reads like a curio cabinet of questionable publication practices. As recounted by blogger Jeffrey Beall, associate professor and scholarly communications librarian at the University of Colorado in Denver, some e-mail requests to submit manuscripts have the awkward wording of a document run through Google Translate. Others suggest a more sophisticated attempt to deceive, and a few publishers and journals have even copied the names and logos of reputable counterparts to fool unwary researchers. Beyond his blog, Mr. Beall compiles lengthy annual lists of shady publishers and stand-alone journals. In a broad sense, he says, they all share 3 traits: they lack transparency, use deception, and do not adhere to industry standards for scholarly publishing. More specifi - cally, “Beall's List of Predatory Open- Access Publishers” is based on roughly 2 dozen criteria (with another 2 dozen practices refl ecting poor journal standards). Among them, Mr. Beall cites the absence of an editorial or review board, the excessive use of spam e-mails to solicit manuscripts, insufficient or hidden information regarding author fees, and false impact factors to feign international standing. Why the subterfuge? “It's all about money,” he says. And business, by most accounts, is booming. Based on Mr. Beall's criteria, Finnish researchers Cenyu Shen and Bo-Christer Björk recently estimated that predatory journals poured more than 420,000 articles into the scientifi c market in 2014, compared with only 53,000 in 2010.1 Mr. Beall's efforts have put him on a fi rst-name basis with a university lawyer due to the legal threats he receives, and a detractor in Serbia once sent him a menacing picture of a knife. Other critics have raised more measured concerns with his methods, his outspoken skepticism of open-source publications, and the feasibility of his blacklists. However, interviews with researchers, editors, and transparency advocates in multiple countries have suggested that more awareness is desperately needed to counter a mushrooming trend in unethical publishing that is only likely to get worse. At an October 2015 meeting of the World Association of Medical Editors in New Delhi, India, Jocalyn Clark, PhD, gave a talk describing predatory journals and their potential impact on authors, institutions, and the scientifi c culture. Attendees were so concerned that they repeatedly raised the issue thereafter, says Dr. Clark, who was then the executive editor at icddr,b, a global health research organization in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and was recently named executive editor of The Lancet. “It felt like it was almost like a cry for help,” she recalls. A symposium on aligning publishing incentives with research transparency and integrity, held during the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference in Washington, DC, in February 2016, offered a far different view of predatory publishing. In response to a question about how to combat the problem, Science editorin- chief Marcia McNutt, PhD, expressed surprise that anyone would confuse a predatory journal with a legitimate one. “I'm not sure where the rocket science is here,” she said. However, as sham and suspect journals continue their upward trajectory, Dr. Clark, Ms. Shen, Mr. Beall, and other observers say many vulnerable researchers in developing countries lack suffi cient resources to distinguish real from predatory. Rather than a mere nuisance, Dr. Clark says, the rapidly growing “Wild West” of deceptive journals is threatening to become a full-blown crisis. According to Ms. Shen and Mr. Björk's analysis, India alone accounts for 27% of predatory publishers, with another 12% located in the rest of Asia, 18% in North America, and 9% in Europe. Researchers could not determine the location of more than a quarter of these publishers. The distribution of corresponding authors was more highly concentrated: approximately 35% were from India, 26% from the rest of Asia, and 16% from Africa, together accounting for more than 3 in 4 journal authors. Ms. Shen, a doctoral student at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki, Finland, says she believes the geographic concentration of authors partially refl ects how researchers are evaluated for their academic positions. In some countries, “international” publishing is required or highly rewarded, but without consideration of the journal's quality. “At the same time, academics from those countries have problems getting their articles accepted in traditional journals from big Anglo-American-Dutch-German publishers,”she says. Dr. Clark puts more of the onus on a research culture that has exported an intense publish-or-perish mindset to India, Bangladesh, and other emerging countries and created a huge new pool of scientists desperate to be authors. “But we're not necessarily providing the level of training and mentorship and support that a lot of scientists get in more developed settings,” she says. The result is fertile ground for exploitation. In 2015, David Moher, PhD, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Ontario, Canada, analyzed the 311 e-mail solicitations he received over a single year. Nearly 80% were from journals on Mr. Beall's list.2 The remainder shared many of the same traits, he writes, but the journals were likely too small or too new to be discovered. Dr. Clark conducted her own weeklong trial and counted twice as many predatory journal spam e-mails sent to her Bangladesh account as were sent to her account at the University of Toronto, where she is an adjunct assistant professor of medicine. The 2:1 ratio is no aberration, she says. Another recent study suggests that most authors published in predatory journals are young, inexperienced, and from developing countries.3 As part of their sales pitch, Mr. Beall says, predatory publishers are essentially hijacking the gold open-access business model, in which a journal fi nances all or part of its publishing costs by assessing article processing charges upon acceptance of authors' manuscripts (Cancer Cytopathology, which is published by Wiley on behalf of the American Cancer Society, uses a hybrid OnlineOpen model in which authors can choose to make their articles open access for a fee). In abusing the model, Mr. Beall says, predatory publishers often promise rapid publication and conduct little or no peer review after collecting the fees. Mr. Beall has attracted controversy himself through his criticism of the openaccess movement and what he views as weaknesses contributing to the exploitation of vulnerable researchers. Dr. Clark, a former senior editor at open-access journal PLOS Medicine, cautions that Mr. Beall's bias and lack of independent review could lead to the erroneous tarring of legitimate journals as predatory. Mr. Beall responds that few other transparency advocates have volunteered to help monitor suspicious publications (although the Directory of Open Access Journals maintains its own “white list” of high-quality journals). “I get e-mails almost every day from people who have been victimized by one or another publisher,” he says. If some naive researchers are being hoodwinked (and based on blog accounts, more than a few researchers in the United States and Europe are among them), others are knowingly using the shortcut to gain an “imprimatur of science,” as one South African researcher told Mr. Beall. At a recent conference on academic misconduct, University of California at Davis law professor Mario Biagioli suggested that rather than preying on authors, predatory journals may be co-conspirators peddling “counterfeit goods.” Either way, the shadowy entrepreneurs face a low startup barrier: after creating a Web site, they can use a template to create a fleet of journals with unique titles and send out spam solicitations to scientists. “It's a really easy and fast way to make a lot of money with almost no investment, and everybody's copying it right now,” Mr. Beall says. Despite their differences, he and Dr. Clark agree that it is a fl ourishing business model the global scientifi c community can no longer afford to ignore.

AB  - The 2022 CSE Annual Meeting will take place May 1–3 in Phoenix, AZ, and we have the honor of serving as this year’s Program Committee Co-Chairs. Along with our dedicated Committee members, we are working diligently to carry on CSE’s tradition of outstanding educational content and networking opportunities. We’re thrilled to announce that the theme for this year’s meeting is “Phoenix Rising: Adapting, Collaborating, and Learning in Scholarly Publishing.” As the first in-person CSE Annual Meeting since 2019, this year’s conference will offer attendees the opportunity to meet new industry colleagues on site. As we have all learned during the past few years, both professionally and personally we must be willing to adapt to changing circumstances, imagine new ways to collaborate, and consider each other as vital sources for new learning. Breakout sessions presented by expert speakers at this year’s annual meeting will be a mix of tried-and-true topics with universal interest to editorial offices, journals, authors, and reviewers, and will include lessons learned during the pandemic. We are looking forward to 2 keynotes this year. First, undoubtedly, you’ve noticed a lot of activity in the mergers and acquisitions space, with publishers buying services companies and long-time service providers buying platforms and technology startups. The Program Committee was curious about how all of these developments would affect publishers, especially society publishers. Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe, Professor and Coordinator for Information Literacy Services at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Roger Schonfeld, Director, Libraries, Scholarly Communication and Museums at Ithaka, have […]

AB  - Since internationally visible scientific productivity is a criterion for state evaluation of Croatian academic and scientific institutions and their scientists, Croatian academic libraries have a key role in quantitative evaluation of scientific productivity using methods such as bibliometrics, scientometrics and the like. The aim of this case study is to identify and illustrate the current situation of library services for evaluating scientific production at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, and to make recommendations for the further development of such services, which could serve as a framework for the systematic implementation of this type of service in all libraries at the University of Zagreb and beyond. More specifically, the purpose of this paper was to identify the existence of the bibliometric services in the libraries of the University of Zagreb (UNIZG), examine the status and involvement of university librarians in the academic advancement procedures and to identify the required competences for bibliometric experts in Croatia. The research was conducted using the content analysis method, the survey method, and the focus group method. The research results show that although UNIZG libraries are integrated into the system of academic promotion and the role of UNIZG libraries is enshrined in Croatian regulations, the bibliometric service is not standardised at the University level. The results also indicate that the service needs to be strengthened in terms of training of professional staff and greater investment in staff capacity and infrastructure. The fact that the study was conducted at a single Croatian university is a possible limitation that could relate to the application of guidelines for further actions and the development of bibliometric services at national level. It would therefore be desirable to conduct future research to identify the situation at other Croatian universities as well. It would also be necessary to determine the open science and open access policies at UNIZG through further research and, in this context, to establish guidelines for possible improvements in the processes of evaluating scientific productivity. The results of this study make an important contribution to the possible future positioning of university libraries and UNIZG librarians in the process of evaluating scientific productivity. In addition, some practical advice is given so that this case study may be a good introductory overview for the wider academic community in relation to this topic.

IS  - 2

AU  - Walton, Kerry
AB  - Campus partnerships are an increasingly common and dynamic entity on college campuses. To successfully achieve institutional goals, campus partners must collaborate and create communities of practice. Open educational resources (OER) is a rapidly growing area in higher education due to the increasing costs of attending college and increased student debt. By providing access to OER, colleges are supporting student success, increasing retention of students, and, most importantly, contributing to reducing students’ higher education debt. OER initiatives often fall under the purview of the academic library. While the library is an excellent place to start an affordable learning initiative, identifying pertinent campus partners and forming communities of practice will improve awareness of OER and increase OER adoption. This study utilized a survey to identify levels of current awareness and adoption of OER among faculty at a master’s comprehensive four-year public university in Pennsylvania. The goal was to provide a benchmark for assessing future progress. It also provided structure and a programming plan for a newly developed collaboration between the library, distance education, and Information Services & Technology. Survey results assisted the partnership in identifying ways to collaborate and implement strategies to increase awareness and adoption of OER on campus.

AB  - The abrupt closure of universities in 2020 because of COVID-19 forced many of them to adopt online learning through various technological platforms. Institutional repositories (IRs), digital archives of intellectual outputs of universities, could be important in online education. However, there is a dearth of empirical data on their ability to support teaching, learning and research in universities. This study aimed to investigate the role of IRs in supporting teaching, learning and research in Kenyan universities during the Covid-19 and to identify challenges faced by the universities in the usage of IRs. The study was informed by the technology acceptance model and adopted a mixed method approach and a multiple-case (embedded) research design. The study was conducted in four universities using a sample of 370 students, 322 academic staff and 12 key informants, selected by a mix of stratified, random, and purposive sampling technique respectively. The study found that IRs played crucial roles in supporting teaching, learning and research during the pandemic, with three out of every four respondents (n=424, 73%) using it for teaching, learning and research. Alarmingly, IR usage was lowest, χ2 (4) = 73.462, p&lt;0.0001, among the senior-most academic staff (professors, associate professors, and senior lecturers) relative to junior staff and students. Perceived lack of usefulness and difficulty of use of IRs constituted the major challenges. This study recommends the improvement of IRs perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to enable them better support teaching, learning and research.

AB  - This is the first of a series of studies emanating from the UK JISC‐funded RoMEO Project (Rights Metadata for Open‐archiving) which investigated the IPR issues relating to academic author self‐archiving of research papers. It considers the claims for copyright ownership in research papers by universities, academics, and publishers by drawing on the literature, a survey of 542 academic authors and an analysis of 80 journal publisher copyright transfer agreements. The paper concludes that self‐archiving is not best supported by copyright transfer to publishers. It recommends that universities assert their interest in copyright ownership in the long term, that academics retain rights in the short term, and that publishers consider new ways of protecting the value they add through journal publishing.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article is the fourth in a series of six emanating from the UK JISC‐funded RoMEO Project (Rights Metadata for Open archiving). It describes an analysis of 80 scholarly journal publishers' copyright agreements with a particular view to their effect on author self‐archiving: 90% of agreements asked for copyright transfer and 69% asked for it prior to refereeing the paper; 75% asked authors to warrant that their work had not been previously published although only two explicitly stated that they viewed self‐archiving as prior publication; 28.5% of agreements provided authors with no usage rights over their own paper. Although 42.5% allowed self‐archiving in some format, there was no consensus on the conditions under which self‐archiving could take place. The article concludes that author–publisher copyright agreements should be reconsidered by a working party representing the needs of both parties.

AB  - In early 2016 a new database was launched on the Web of Science platform—Russian Science Citation Index. The database is free to all Web of Science subscribers except those from the post-Soviet states. This database includes papers from 652 selected Russian journals and is based on the data from national citation index—Russian Index of Science Citation (RISC). RISC was launched in 2005 but it is scarcely known to the English-language audience. The paper describes the history, current structure and user possibilities of RISC. We focus on the novel features of RISC which are crucial to bibliometrics and are unavailable in the international citation indexes.

AB  - Many Earth science disciplines are currently experiencing the emergence of new ways of data publication and the establishment of an information technology infrastructure for data archiving and exchange. Building on efforts to standardize data and metadata publication in geochemistry [ Staudigel et al. , 2002], here we discuss options for data publication, archiving and exchange. All of these options have to be structured to meet some minimum requirements of scholarly publication, in particular reliability of archival, reproducibility and falsifiability. All data publication and archival methods should strive to produce databases that are fully interoperable and this requires an appropriate data and metadata interchange protocol. To accomplish the latter we propose a new Metadata Interchange Format (.mif) that can be used for more effective sharing of data and metadata across digital libraries, data archives, and research projects. This is not a proposal for a particular set of metadata parameters but rather of a methodology that will enable metadata parameter sets to be easily developed and interchanged between research organizations. Examples are provided for geochemical data as well as map images to illustrate the flexibility of the approach.

AB  - This perspective highlights the potential of enhancing data systems to improve our understanding of the world and scale up the production of knowledge. It shows that despite an increase in data from various publications over time, we still experience limitations in scaling our systems. Shifts toward a more person-centric view of the world and enhanced open access to data can help address this challenge. The democratization of data is key in providing high-quality data about authors, their interests, and their work's impact, aiding relationships with authors and libraries and easing the burden of scaling. However, this requires collaboration and investment across the ecosystem.

AB  - ABSTRACT In summer 2009 ALPSP undertook the first industry‐wide survey into scholarly book publishing practice. This article covers the key findings and attempts to describe the current scholarly book and e‐book publishing landscape. Publishers' development of e‐books varies considerably from early experimentation to being a standard component of their publishing programme. However, publishers of all shapes and sizes have developed some common policies and practices despite the rapid evolution of an emerging element of scholarly publishing. E‐books currently make up a small, if growing, proportion of total book sales, although they are currently one of the most talked about developments in the entire publishing industry.

AB  - Existing systems, which are based on peer review, formal publication and surrender of copyright and characterised by increases in volume and costs, and lack of competition, are an obstacle to scholarly communication. Through a joint approach by all participants in the communication process, it may be possible to find a solution to the problems. Such a solution will probably require a blend of co-operation and competition in order to remove the current monopoly power.

AB  - This article reports on scholarly communication and open access ( OA ) in Korea. Drawing on a range of databases, articles, and reference sources, it provides unique insights. In contrast to the UK / US model of scholarly communication, in Korea, most scholarly journals are published by discipline‐based scholarly societies and research institutes affiliated to universities. Payment for publication is the norm, and typically features article processing charges and scholarly society membership fees for both OA and toll access ( TA ) journals. Online access to journals in Korea is provided by commercial vendors who enter into contracts with the scholarly societies for exclusive use. Three online access models apply – TA , gold OA , and dual access – with the use of these models varying between disciplines. In parallel with this access provided by commercial vendors, there are a number of government‐funded open access repositories (OARs) to which university researchers are requested to deposit their research outputs, as well as OARs run by universities and other research institutes.

These opportunities have also destabilized norms about the character of legitimate scholarly publishing in some fields. Unfortunately, much of the literature about scholarly e-publishing homogenizes the character of publishing. This article provides an analytical approach for evaluating disciplinary conventions and for proposing policies about scholarly e-publishing. We characterize three dimensions of scholarly publishing as a communicative practice—publicity, access, and trustworthiness—and examine several forms of paper and electronic publications in this framework. This analysis shows how the common claim that e-publishing "substantially expands access" is oversimplified. It also indicates how peer reviewing (whether in paper or electronically) provides valuable functions for scholarly communication that are not effectively replaced by self-posting articles in electronic media.

AB  - It is important to put scholarly communication in context by addressing the very broad idea of why scholarly communication is important.One of the main missions of universities is to create new knowledge and innovations-i.e., research.This new knowledge needs to be disseminated-to be exchanged such that the scholars creating the new knowledge are in touch with others, all contributing to the original ideas and new insights of each other.But scholarly communication is not just about people working at the same time on problems that are somehow connected; it is also about archiving research results for investigators of the future.In addition, it is critical that higher education is very much about educating students to be creative and innovative and, in this sense, access to research results and processes is critical for effective education.In short, scholarly communication is critical for both the research and educational missions of universities.

Readers hear from nearly 80 scholarly communications (scholcomm) practitioners, offering a range of perspectives on everything from coordinating an OER program to supporting reproducible research through the curation of open data. The book, intended for MLIS students and those new to scholcomm, addresses several well-known curricular gaps in the profession's training—namely, in the areas of copyright, open data, open education, and scholarly publishing. Scholarly Communication Librarianship provides both the contextual information, and the practical skills and resources necessary for a deep, multi-faceted understanding of scholcomm and all it entails.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines issues relating to the perceptions and adoption of open access (OA) and institutional repositories. Using a survey research design, we collected data from academics and other researchers in the humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS) at a university in Australia. We looked at factors influencing choice of publishers and journal outlets, as well as the use of social media and nontraditional channels for scholarly communication. We used an online questionnaire to collect data and used descriptive statistics to analyse the data. Our findings suggest that researchers are highly influenced by traditional measures of quality, such as journal impact factor, and are less concerned with making their work more findable and promoting it through social media. This highlights a disconnect between researchers’ desired outcomes and the efforts that they put in toward the same. Our findings also suggest that institutional policies have the potential to increase OA awareness and adoption. This study contributes to the growing literature on scholarly communication by offering evidence from the HASS field, where limited studies have been conducted. Based on the findings, we recommend that academic librarians engage with faculty through outreach and workshops to change perceptions of OA and the institutional repository.

AB  - ABSTRACT ‘Communities’ has become a buzzword in the strategy departments of publishing companies. It is clear – and becoming clearer – that the Internet is not merely a potential information delivery route but a vehicle for bringing together communities. One of the problems, however, is that much of the scholarly activity on the Web is driven by people with a traditional information delivery role – writers, publishers, booksellers and subscription agents and librarians. Nobody questions the importance of these roles but community creation is different and requires skills which are frequently closer to caterers or advertising agencies or hoteliers. Time will tell how communities will develop. Whatever happens it is clear that the world of scholarly publishing is going to change beyond recognition in the next decade – and most of that change is for the better.

AB  - If we were to start from scratch today to design a quality-controlled archive and distribution system for scientific and technical information, it could take a very different form from what has evolved in the past decade from pre-existing print infrastructure. Ultimately, we might expect some form of global knowledge network for research communications. Over the next decade, there are many technical and non-technical issues to address along the way, everything from identifying optimal formats and protocols for rendering, indexing, linking, querying, accessing, mining, and transmitting the information, to identifying sociological, legal, financial, and political obstacles to realization of ideal systems. What near-term advances can we expect in automated classification systems, authoring tools, and next-generation document formats to facilitate efficient data mining and long-term archival stability? How will the information be authenticated and quality controlled? What differences should be expected in the realization of these systems for different scientific research fields? Can recent technological advances provide not only more efficient means of accessing and navigating the information, but also more cost-effective means of authentication and quality control? Relevant experiences from open electronic distribution of research materials in physics and related disciplines during the past decade are used to illuminate these questions, and some of their implications for proposals to improve the implementation of peer review are then discussed.

AB  - While the business models used in most segments of the media industry have been profoundly changed by the Internet, surprisingly little has changed in the publishing of scholarly peer reviewed journals. Electronic delivery has become the norm, but the same publishers as before are still dominating the market, selling content to subscribers. This article asks the question why Open Access (OA) to the output of mainly publicly funded research hasn't yet become the mainstream business model. OA implies a reversal of the revenue logic from readers paying for content to authors paying for dissemination in form of universal free access. The current situation is analyzed using Porter's five forces model. The analysis demonstrates a lack of competitive pressure in this industry, leading to so high profit levels of the leading publishers that they have not yet felt a strong need to change the way they operate. OA funded by article publishing charges (APCs) might nevertheless start rapidly becoming more common. The driving forces of change currently consist of the public research funders and administrations in Europe, which are pushing for OA by starting dedicated funds for paying the APCs of authors from the respective countries. This has in turn lead to a situation in which publishers have introduced "big deals" involving the bundling of (a) subscription to all their journals, (b) APCs for their hybrid journals and (c) in the future also APCs to their full OA journals. This appears to be a relatively risk free strategy for the leading publishers to retain both their dominance of the market and high profit levels.

AB  - The digitization of journal content and its availability online has revolutionized journal publishing in recent years, resulting in both opportunities and challenges for traditional journal publishers. The explosion of data and the emergence of new players such as Google, new business models like Open Access, and new content consumers and producers, for example, China are significantly changing the face of journal publishing. It is not yet clear what the impact of these changes will be but by continuing to collaborate with our existing stakeholders and building partnerships with these newcomers, as well as by maintaining and promoting the quality of our content, we can ensure our future growth and success.

AB  - This study used all-journal data and systematic random sampling data to primarily determine the average number of issues per year and the average number of articles per issue among the Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD) (China), and Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index (CSSCI) (China) journals. The random sampling data were based on 5% SCI and SSCI samples and 10% CSCD and CSSCI samples. The objectives were to have a 2018–2019 record of the journal publication frequency detailing the number of articles per issue and the number of issues per year for the journals on the lists, as well as to compare Chinese journals’ data with those of international journals, in the perspective of scholarly publishing transformations in the world as well as in China during the past two decades. The study found that the average number of issues per year for SCI, SSCI, CSCD, and CSSCI journals was 10.95, 5.18, 9.17, and 7.87, respectively, and that CSCD/CSSCI journals publish more articles than SCI/SSCI, with CSSCI journals publishing significantly more articles per year than SSCI journals. The author fees for non-OA journals in China could play a role in the higher number of articles. The “mega journal” phenomenon does not seem to be a common practice among all the journal lists studied.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report the outcomes of a Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)‐sponsored study to determine the current state and trends in different forms of scholarly output used in teaching and research; and the nature and extent of problems associated with their use. Design/methodology/approach A total of 60 UK HE institutions were chosen at random and a selection of departments within these was contacted. An online questionnaire was distributed to the selected departments; resulting in responses from 304 academics across a broad range of subjects and institution types. Findings The study showed that printed output was still the preferred option in both teaching and research, although electronic journals now have a well‐established presence. Web‐based material is increasingly provided in teaching and used in research but this includes primarily traditional tools such as reading lists and links to scholarly resources. Some content creation was evident. Use of web 2.0 was not extensive, although respondents were making use of Institutional Learning Environments. Academics were aware of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues but not always clear about their responsibilities in this area. Research limitations/implications The study revealed an essentially conservative approach to the developments in digital information. This may have been due to the sample size which was relatively small, and the age profile which clustered around the 45‐65 years range. In the case of research the influence of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) was clear. Originality/value No equivalent study has been reported on the transition between traditional and new forms of scholarly output used in teaching and research. In this fast developing area this research provides a benchmark for future studies.

AB  - “Publication is the hard currency of science. It is the primary yardstick for establishing priority of discovery, making the status of a publication a critical factor in resolving priority disputes or intellectual property claims.” (International Working Group, 2000) Nurse authors, especially those just starting out with publishing their work, may be unsure about which type of publication it is best to aim for. The purpose of this article is to assist in making this choice. The objective is to show what makes a publication scholarly, what an editor looks for when deciding to publish an article, and lastly the peer review process. This will help nurse authors to decide whether a peer-reviewed publication is the appropriate place for their articles, and the process used by editors when deciding whether to accept articles. ‘Scholarly publishing is a communicative practice within a community’ and ‘an activity engaged in by scholars who primarily want their reports to be widely read and credited by their target audience’ (Kling and McKim 1999 p.890). Scholarly publication is a social process, not an activity undertaken in isolation, as often other scholars review, test and critique the information presented. As Borgman (2000 p. 412) explained, ‘research in all fields is incomplete until it is validated through review processes and shared with others‘. Scholarly publication is most often divided into three stages: first, informal communication, which now occurs largely through the use of electronic media (Gabbay, 2000); second, the initial public dissemination of research through conferences and proceedings, and finally, formal publication i.e. in journals or books, chapters in books, articles, on-line formal and public proceedings, most of which are peer-reviewed (Graham, 2000). These formal publications are often the result of extensive review of literature (meta-analysis), personal clinical experiences (case studies) or rigorous research. As they seek opportunities to publish their work, scholars may find it difficult to determine which source is the best especially in terms of what is scholarly and what is not (Rozenzweiz, 1999). There are three key ways to identify a scholarly publication. The first question to ask is: Who does the writing? In a scholarly publication the writing of the manuscript is done by a scholar/researcher in the field. They have the education and credentials that assure the reader that they have the knowledge to write on the topic. The scholar/researcher is reporting on the results of work for which they are responsible. In more popular publications some of the writing may be done by a staff writer, who is most often a professional reporter or a journalist. They interview others and report information learned. They have not done the research or the review or experienced the clinical case study, but instead report on work done by someone other than themselves. Some of the writing may also be done by nurses, but in a more reader-friendly and less academic style that will appeal to busy practitioners who do not have the time or confidence to read scholarly journals. However, these popular publications often publish information that is based on research or other types of evidence and can be used to develop or improve practice. Examples of such popular nursing publications are Nursing Times in the UK, Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners in the USA and Australian Electronic Journal of Nursing Education (AEJNE) in Australia. The second question to ask is: Who are the readers? Scholarly publications are intended to be read by other scholars interested in the same field or discipline. Nurse educators also draw on these kinds of publications for their teaching, and recommend them on reading lists for their students. More popular publications are intended to be read by general readers. The articles often omit features that a researcher would want to know, such as statistics or probability information, and focus more on the ‘take home message’ or practical implications of the topic. The third question to ask is: Is the publication peer reviewed? Manuscripts submitted to scholarly publications are sent for review to other scholars or researchers who have expertise in the topic discussed. These reviewers critique the manuscript and make recommendations on whether or not it should be published. This process is called peer review and is extremely important in determining whether the manuscript is noteworthy. It will determine if the manuscript is appropriate for their publication and if it meets the rigor expected of articles published. As mentioned above, peer review is the key to determining whether a manuscript is scholarly or not. Before a manuscript can be published in most scientific journals, it must be reviewed by colleagues (“peers”) who are experts in the topic written about in the manuscript. Peer review is a method of providing a system of determining quality of material to be published and assuring readers that the information they read is reliable and valid – worth their attention and time. Why is peer review so important? In this process, each article undergoes “blind” or anonymous review by a group of “peers” (scholars with similar expertise and education). These “peers” are the experts, scholars and colleagues of those who themselves write articles and books, and are often university professors. Most peer reviewers have extensive publishing experience on the research or topic on which the article or book focuses. “Blind” peer review is the most reliable and valid form of peer review process because the reviewers do not know the authors' names or university affiliations. This protects the reviewers' ability to give constructive criticism without fear of reprisal from an offended author (Scarry 1991). Authors benefit from the blind review in that, if a manuscript is poorly written, their careers are not jeopardized because the reviewers would have no means of identifying who the authors are. After the peer reviewers have completed their reviews, they are forwarded to the author with recommendations that the manuscript is ready for publication as it stands (very rarely); the manuscript is suitable for publication if certain modifications can be made, questions answered and any errors corrected; or the manuscript is not suitable for publication and has been rejected. The manuscript may be suitable for publication but does not fit the particular focus of the journal, and the reviewers or editor may suggest submitting it to a different journal. Only in the first two cases will the manuscript reach print, and in the second it will probably be returned to the reviewers for another round of scrutiny before actual acceptance for publication. This is what makes peer-reviewed scholarly publications so valuable. Choosing the most appropriate scholarly publication is vital to an author's publishing success. As well as the points discussed in this article, an early step is to check out possible journals by looking at hard copies in an academic library or by going to journals' websites. These websites will also take you to each journal's author guidelines, which need to be applied as closely as possible to improve the articles chances of success.

AB  - Scholarly publishing serves the formal communication needs of scholars or researchers and derives from, and is constructed to reflect, their aspirations and behaviour. Specifically, journal publishing was invented by Oldenburg in 1665 to solve some of the competitive jealousies that existed between the experimentalist founding fathers of the Royal Society. The solutions he came up with have endured to the present day and have even survived the transition to electronic delivery. This article surveys the reasons why this should be so and examines the modern world of electronic journal publishing with particular reference to the players in the publishing cycle, the digital transition, economics and the advent of open access.

AB  - The World Wide Web is opening up access to documents and data for scholars. However it has not yet impacted on one of the primary activities in research: assessing new findings in the light of current knowledge and debating it with colleagues. The ClaiMaker system uses a directed graph model with similarities to hypertext, in which new ideas are published as nodes, which other contributors can build on or challenge in a variety of ways by linking to them. Nodes and links have semantic structure to facilitate the provision of specialist services for interrogating and visualizing the emerging network. By way of example, this paper is grounded in a ClaiMaker model to illustrate how new claims can be described in this structured way.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study examines aspects of scholarly journal publishing in the Nordic countries. On average half of Nordic journals publish online. In most Nordic countries, commercial publishers predominate; however, in Finland the majority are society publishers. The number of open access journals is low, in line with international figures. There is concern to maintain local languages in journal publishing. A majority of the journals publishing in local languages are within social science, humanities, and arts; the STM sector publishes in English. English‐language publications are favoured in research assessments, international recognition, and impact, while the visibility of local‐language scholarly journals in international databases is low. The Nordbib program supports Nordic scholarly journals and fosters co‐operation with publishing companies and learned societies over migration to e‐publishing; it also supports open access. The article discusses future challenges for journal publishing, pointing out the problems of small journal publishers and the need for co‐operation between stakeholders.

AB  - The cost of access to scholarly research creates inequity for readers with varying resources. Open access publishing is an avenue to address this inequity. This research employed a survey of scholars to discover what they know and think about open access. The survey elicited both faculty and doctoral student perspectives. Data were analyzed according to rank and discipline. Although the majority of scholars across disciplines agreed that their work should be freely available to all readers, there were significant differences between disciplines regarding whether scholars had distributed their publications through open access. The survey instrument was examined through Exploratory Factor Analysis.

AB  - The system of scholarly publishing was established four centuries ago to serve scholars and researchers in disseminating, registering, and archiving their works and maintaining quality control. In many ways, the twenty-first-century journals are not so different from their early predecessors, and they continue to serve these multiple functions in an effective way. As in the past, journal editors manage peer review and referee databases, and authors write in linear text and build on previous knowledge through citations and reference links. Publishers bundle articles into issues and disseminate these physical objects. Librarians continue to manage physical storage on library shelves while publishers have created vast digital PDF warehouses. However, some fundamental changes are also taking place in scholarly publishing, presenting opportunities and challenges for researchers, publishers, and librarians. One such trend is the relentless growth in the size of the research base itself. Data from the Journal Citation Report (Thomson Reuters) illustrate this growth. In 2008 there were 960 journals, publishing a total of 220 000 articles in physics and related areas. In 1998, the corresponding figures were 720 and 140 000, representing 35% and 56% growth rates, respectively. The emergence of new research areas, such as nanoscience and nanotechnology, fuels part of this growth. The largest single growth factor, however, is the volume of published research from China, the result of China becoming a world power in science. The growth in the volume of published research puts pressure on established editorial processes and peer review systems, and affects referees’ willingness to engage in peer review—one of the essential pillars of the current system. The growing number of journals (look at the number of Nature progeny compared to ten years ago!) means that it has never been a better time to be an author—There are journals of all shapes and sizes to accommodate every author's needs. For editors and publishers, it means that the competition to attract authors of best research to a journal is more intense. In contrast, library budgets have not tracked this growth in published research. The pressure has been alleviated to some extent by the creation of new pricing models, and library purchasing consortia that have effectively reduced the unit cost of information and had the added benefit of providing greater online access to more journals than ever before. (In some cases, it is not individual subscribers who are customers but whole countries, via their Ministry of Education or Research using a national funding mechanism and pricing formula.) Most obviously, the internet has had a major impact on scholarly publishing. Systems required to publish a journal are now web based. For example, the American Institute of Physics (AIP) conducts web peer review using its Peer X-Press system, and accomplishes online distribution via its journal hosting system Scitation. These systems have proven very popular with authors and readers; in 2009, Scitation delivered more than full-text downloads. While most publishers have digitized back issues of journals (back to volume one in many cases), creating huge PDF warehouses, they have done little so far to address one of the persistent desires researchers express: How do I find the information I need to do my teaching and research and keep up to date? With the growing information overabundance, it is paramount that publishers begin to address this need and deliver better value by using informatics and semantic technologies to extract meaning from the large body of research now being held in the PDF warehouses. AIP is addressing this challenge by becoming an informatics-based publisher, not just a document-centric PDF publisher. Another emerging trend around the world is that governments and other funding bodies are taking a greater interest in the outputs of research that they fund as one way to promote public access. Some funding agencies have mandated that authors must deposit articles resulting from the research they fund in an institutional or subject repository at some point after the version of record has been published in a journal. In most cases, these repositories provide access to their content with no access restrictions. The embargoes between publication in a journal and open access in a repository typically range from 6 to 12 months. Within the above context, open access continues to attract a lot of attention as a business model. Publishers such as Public Library of Science and BioMed Central are open access publishers, where the author is required to pay a fee to publish and readers can access the content of these so-called OA journals at no charge. Authors’ interests in this type of arrangement vary depending on their subject fields and willingness to pay an author fee, which ranges from $1000 to $3000 per article. While there is traction for this model in some biomedical areas, there seems to be little interest, so far, in fields such as physics and chemistry. In contrast, the more familiar business model involves libraries paying a license fee or subscription to provide access to its patrons. Thus, scholarly publishing seems to be caught between two worlds that complement each other in certain ways and contrast in others. There is a world of mass linear information overabundance, and a world of relevant knowledge discoverability, business models that focus on author side or reader side payment models; multiple versions of content sit in repositories and on journal websites, all combined with a general eastward (Asia Pacific) shift in the “center of gravity” of research. There is considerable tension between these worlds. One way forward is to enhance value starting with the understanding of the true needs of scholars and researchers and responding to those needs more effectively in the online world. This will involve more than just incremental steps or using tried and tested models that have been in place for many years. Scholarly publishing will not only involve some form of validation and quality control mechanisms but also be more closely connected to researchers’ work flows, providing information they need when and where they need it in the research process. “Flat” PDFs that publishers so efficiently produce today will not be enough. While the old world of scholarly publishing is waning, the new world is emerging slowly through innovation and collaboration and by ensuring sustainable business models.

AB  - The peer-review crisis is posing a risk to the scholarly peer-reviewed journal system. Journals have to ask many potential peer reviewers to obtain a minimum acceptable number of peers accepting reviewing a manuscript. Several solutions have been suggested to overcome this shortage. From reimbursing for the job, to eliminating pre-publication reviews, one cannot predict which is more dangerous for the future of scholarly publishing. And, why not acknowledging their contribution to the final version of the article published? PubMed created two categories of contributors: authors [AU] and collaborators [IR]. Why not a third category for the peer-reviewer?

AB  - The increasing momentum towards opening up various dimensions of society is discussed in this article, and the authors consider whether ‘open’ is now an unstoppable force for change in the world. Various topics within research communication, such as open access (OA) and post-publication peer review (PPPR), are considered from the perspective of the authors as participants in the scholarly communication community of more than 20 years’ standing, with both for- and non-profit credentials.The authors explore how harnessing the wisdom of the crowd in rating everyday services manifests itself by improving our ability to make choices in our daily lives. They explain how this network effect can be applied to scholarly communication and how it provided some of the inspiration behind the launch of ScienceOpen, the research and OA publishing network, in May 2014. This publishing platform is then described as an example of democratizing publishing. The increasing importance of software development in publishing and the need for stand-alone expertise in this space (as opposed to a publisher-centric approach) is also discussed.Finally, the authors consider the role that the impact factor and the promotion/tenure system play in holding back progress in scholarly communication and they highlight the efforts of early career researchers to break the stalemate by taking ‘open’ pledges.

AB  - Scientists at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines, generate a large volume of research results emanating from donor-funded projects. The main objective is to disseminate, as widely as possible, the results of IRRI's research. There is also a strong push to provide free open access to these information resources through modes convenient to researchers in both developing and developed countries.&#x0D; &#x0D; Certain instruments for open access (OA) are already in place at IRRI, including links to full-text publications posted on the Institute's Web site (http://www.irri.org/), especially via the Library branch site (http://ricelib.irri.cgiar.org/), the Rice Knowledge Bank (http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/), and Rice Publications Archive (http://rice-publications.irri.org/). The joint initiatives of the Library and the Institute's main science publishing units, particularly Communication and Publications Services and the Training Center, typify a convergence of practices to overcome hurdles to OA implementation. &#x0D; &#x0D; This paper explores how the links in IRRI's scholarly publishing chain, bridging information management and publishing, can effectively deliver public goods (knowledge about rice, in this case) to the intended primary users -- researchers and extensionists in the national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES) in developing countries.&#x0D; &#x0D; It also discusses publishing models for delivering public goods generated by an international research organization. To meet its mission, IRRI must employ various demand-supply models to disseminate information. Open access publishing is one model to adopt but first, the onus is on the Institute to overcome issues such as intellectual property rights, funding, and connectivity.&#x0D; &#x0D; IRRI's donors, NARES partners, governments, and rice farmers and consumers expect it to create and share information for the common good, and it strives to convert its resources into electronic format for delivery over the Internet. However, not all its stakeholders are connected.&#x0D; &#x0D; To create impact, IRRI must deliver information through whatever appropriate form, be it cutting-edge digital versions or traditional hard-copy books. This paper discusses this dilemma and hopes to encourage further research and thought on open access publishing.

AB  - The Web is revolutionizing the entire scholarly communication process and changing the way that researchers exchange information. In this paper, we analyze two views of information production and use in computer-related research based on citation analysis of PDF and Postcript formatted publications on the Web using autonomous citation indexing (ACI), and a parallel citation analysis of the journal literature indexed by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in SCISEARCH. Our goal is to establish a baseline profile of computer science "literature" as it appears in the published journals and as it appears on the publicly available Web. From this starting point, we hope to identify additional research areas dealing with information dissemination and citation practices in computer science and the utility of autonomous citation indexing on the Web as an adjunct to commercial indexing

AB  - INTRODUCTION Successful open access (OA) publishing in libraries requires careful guidance and organization. Support and services offered vary depending on available resources as well as the robustness of a library’s publishing program. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM This article describes the connection between publishing services and scholarly publishing literacy through examples from the University of South Florida (USF) Libraries. The USF Libraries’ OA publishing program includes journals, textbooks, conference proceedings, and more. Our program balances advocating for open access with advising for actions that serve our partners’ goals. This invites trust, sustainable relationships, and opportunities for new work. NEXT STEPS At the USF Libraries, more work must be done to formally assess our efforts. Our program will also explore new ways to support the ethical standards expected of libraries by pursuing stronger policies on diversity and inclusion. Using everyday work to demonstrate best practices is a manageable way to strengthen scholarly publishing efforts. We hope to continue growing our services, empowering our partners, and exploring our roles as advisors and advocates.

AB  - How many invitations did you receive last week to publish your latest research data in a journal with a name very similar to those of our classic scientific journals? The reason for this generosity must be the high chance of cheating researchers so that they pay article processing charges. These journals have been denominated ‘predatory journals’ and have interested a Canadian librarian, Charles Beall, to a very high extent. The so-called ‘Beall’s list of predatory journals’ has become widely recognized (1), and today it contains more than 1000 titles. Since the number of ‘invitations’ seems to increase constantly there must be some authors that are accepting these offers. This might also be one reason for why traditional scientific journals have been facing decreasing numbers of submissions for a while. So when such offers appear in your inbox, do consult this Beall’s list. If indeed, which most often is the case, you find the journal on that list, you should forget about submitting anything to them. There is a great risk that besides losing some money you will also lose control of your manuscript. It might just disappear in cyber space or be blocked/lost in a production process that goes on forever.

AB  - Since the founding of the Royal Society in the 1660s and with the development of disciplinary fields in the later nineteenth century, scholarly societies have established themselves as mediators of the professional lives of faculty and as vital components of the ecology of scholarly communication. In their interactions with libraries, societies may appear primarily as publishers of newsletters, books, reports, journals, indexes, and databases, but they also promote the creation and diffusion of knowledge by serving as hubs for professional activity, contributors to the making of public policy and opinion, providers of education, representatives of the interests of their members, and, more generally, shapers of the institutions and purposes of higher education.

AB  - Last spring a faculty member asked me to find theirh-index, collect the Impact Factor (IF) for all the journalsin which they were published, and compile the numberof citations each of their articles had received. WhenI presented the results, they insisted their work was moreinfluential than what the metrics suggested. I explainedwhy IFs for specialized journals were lower than moregeneralized publications such as Science or Nature, andwhy citation counts for recent articles need time to grow.I introduced the topic of altmetrics, or alternative metrics,and how they could help this faculty member build a morecomplete picture of their research impact.Altmetrics measure research impact by includingreferences outside of traditional scholarly publishing [1].These social web metrics were first proposed in 2010as a response to scholars moving their work online [2].Altmetrics analyze tweets, blogs, presentations, newsarticles, comments, or any social commentary about adiverse group of scholarly activities that are captured onthe web [2].As librarians have been explaining for years, there arelimits to what IF and h-index figures can tell us. A juniorfaculty member may have created and shared hundreds ofcaptivating lectures online but only published a fewarticles. That teaching is not reflected in their h-index.They may author a widely followed blog in which theyengage with an audience of academic peers, but there is noIF for the blog. As numbers of Twitter followers orFacebook friends quantify social media activity, altmetricsmeasure and rank researcher output, impact, and influencefrom the social web.Before continuing, I should declare any possible con-flicts of interest. I have been a tester for Altmetric.comsince September 2013, and I have enjoyed free access to theAltmetric.com Explorer. Aside from that association, I ama health librarian working in an academic research centrewithout any financial interest in altmetric products. I amwriting from the perspective of an information specialistwho uses altmetrics to track research publications, toassess the impact of my centre’s social media communica-tion strategy, and to plan future knowledge disseminationprojects.I first heard about altmetrics at the Medical LibraryAssociation conference in 2013. The topic of this intriguingnew cross-section of social media and article metricswas heard at numerous sessions. Altmetric start-ups werepushing products that measured research in a differentway, and librarians were excited to learn more.The obvious caveat about altmetrics is that they are onlyvalid and valuable for the most recent publications [3, 4].A 2013 publication in Annals of Internal Medicine on lifestyleinterventions for diabetes [5] received a score of 148 by theAltmetric.com Explorer. The score was calculated basedon 128 Twitter users sharing the publication, two bloggersciting the article, and seven Facebook users mentioning it.In context, the article was amongst the highest ever scoredin Annals of Internal Medicine, (ranked 37 out of 2470). Incontrast, a 2005 publication from the same journal oncoronary artery disease [6] received no score. Social mediamentions are rare for articles published prior to 2011 [4, 7],and altmetric products often exclude older datasets in theiranalysis [8].Some altmetric tools, such as Altmetric.com in theaforementioned example, tell us about individual articlesand others tell us about researchers. Researcher-focusedproducts, such as ImpactStory and ResearchGate, resem-ble familiar social networking sites in that they rely oncontributors creating and maintaining personal profiles.The evolution from Facebook to LinkedIn to ImpactStorymakes logical sense. User-contributed profiles becameonline re´sume´s and then dynamic curricula vitae withembedded metrics for research products. For researcher-focused altmetric tools, older publications, presentations,and products can be manually added. These products thattell us about researchers are more likely to includecontributions prior to 2011, and for that reason they arebetter for analyzing research output over time than article-focused altmetric tools.Because different altmetric tools tell different stories, thelandscape is full of start-ups positioning themselves as

AB  - Abstract From a fledgling technology with no proven business models, electronic books (e-books) have grown in importance usurping traditional formats as an acquisitions budget line in many academic library contexts. Business models include purchase, subscription, and pay per use. In academic and research libraries, web based e-book delivery is the dominant platform involving desktop, Netbook and iPad user agents. E-books are the hot property of today’s academic library, forming the new wave in information services along with web scale discovery and institutional repositories. This paper reports the results of a preliminary analysis of transactional e-log data describing academic and student use of Ebook Library (EBL) titles at Edith Cowan University (ECU) Library, Perth, Western Australia. The data mined and analysed encompassing Semesters One and Two of the 2010 academic year. Analysis includes descriptive statistics and other metrics describing e-book usage patterns and user behaviour. The paper compares usage patterns observed with earlier studies and reports on the phenomenon of the ‘power user’.

Based on a literature review and a structured analysis of 8 carefully selected web sites, this study explores: (i) the evolving business models of scientific journals; (ii) the new competitive dynamics triggered by open access and article-level metrics; (iii) the traditional and emerging forms of peer review; and (iv) the emerging ICT-enabled changes in research workflows. The findings depict a highly complex and dynamic scenario, in which different scholarly communities, with their respective institutional and organizational environments, are experimenting different ICT-based arrangements and solutions, which are dramatically widening the range of possible activity systems through which scientific knowledge is created, exchanged, evaluated and leveraged.

AB  - The internet is rapidly becoming the first place for researchers to publish documents, but at present they receive little support in searching, tracking, analysing or debating concepts in a literature from scholarly perspectives. This paper describes the design rationale and implementation of ScholOnto, an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse. It enables researchers to describe and debate via a semantic network the contributions a document makes, and its relationship to the literature. The paper discusses the computational services that an ontology-based server supports, alternative user interfaces to support interaction with a large semantic network, usability issues associated with knowledge formalisation, new work practices that could emerge, and related work.

AB  - &lt;img src=” https://s3.amazonaws.com/production.scholastica/article/34241/large/res_articles.jpeg?1649278121”&gt; Science publishing has many problems today. Some of them are caused by external factors, such as the computer and internet revolution. Others are because of the publication explosion and the resulting imbalance between the interests of science, authors, institutions, and the publishing business. However, these pains are part of the overall growth, nothing more. Society needs science more than ever, but progress cannot be made without reliable communication in publications. Publications are not science; they are yesterday’s information and knowledge, which are organized, stored, and shared on various media. It is important to understand actual problems with publications and consider what you can do.

AB  - Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) of a document is a challenging problem that requires discourse-level understanding. Information extraction from scholarly articles nowadays is a critical use case for researchers to understand the underlying research quickly and move forward, especially in this age of infodemic. MRC on research articles can also provide helpful information to the reviewers and editors. However, the main bottleneck in building such models is the availability of human-annotated data. In this paper, firstly, we introduce a dataset to facilitate question answering (QA) on scientific articles. We prepare the dataset in a semi-automated fashion having more than 100k human-annotated context-question-answer triples. Secondly, we implement one baseline QA model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Additionally, we implement two models: the first one is based on Science BERT (SciBERT), and the second is the combination of SciBERT and Bi-Directional Attention Flow (Bi-DAF). The best model (i.e., SciBERT) obtains an F1 score of 75.46%. Our dataset is novel, and our work opens up a new avenue for scholarly document processing research by providing a benchmark QA dataset and standard baseline. We make our dataset and codes available here at https://github.com/TanikSaikh/Scientific-Question-Answering.

AB  - The appearance of the Philosophical Transactions in 1665 marked the emergence of scientific journals as the dominant mode for dissemination of research and discoveries. The journal system served numerous fundamental needs within the scientific community and encouraged a climate of increased sharing of knowledge. As the rhetoric of scientific discourse evolved over time, a highly stable format emerged to govern the research article as a genre. In the contemporary era of networked science, however, informal scientific communication is also growing in importance as researchers turn to online collaborative tools for even more rapid sharing of results and work in progress.

AB  - Neural network models enjoy success on language tasks related to Web documents, including news and Wikipedia articles. However, the characteristics of scientific publications pose specific challenges that have yet to be satisfactorily addressed: the discourse structure of scientific documents crucial in scholarly document processing (SDP) tasks, the interconnected nature of scientific documents, and their multimodal nature. We survey modern neural network learning methods that tackle these challenges: those that can model discourse structure and their interconnectivity and use their multimodal nature. We also highlight efforts to collect large-scale datasets and tools developed to enable effective deep learning deployment for SDP. We conclude with a discussion on upcoming trends and recommend future directions for pursuing neural natural language processing approaches for SDP.

AB  - was edited by Miriam Balaban, who served as both general chairman and program chairman for th^ Conference.Containing transcriptions of all Conference speeches and formal discussions, the book presents a brief his tory jof scientific editing-and scientific editors' associations; a wide ly.et fairly detailed view of the problems, practices, and at titudes of scientific editors today; and glimpses of the ideas of scientific editors about their roles in years to come.Moreover, this view of the past, present, and future of scientific editor ship includes much consideration-of editors' interaction with authors, referees, and publishers.Mrs. Balaban's preface points out that Faraday, in 1821, identified "three necessary stages of useful -research": to begin, to end, and to publish.The first conference on scien tific publication, however, was not held until 127 years later in 1948, when the Royal Society Information Conference in London dealt with publication, format, editorial policy, ab stracting, indexing, classification of subjects, and training of "information officers."In 1958, the National Academy of Sciences held an Interna tional Conference on Scientific Information in Washington! it dealt with the storage and retrieval of documents.At that time, the "cycle of information" was said to be in the hands of the maker, the storer/supplier, and the user.Soon, however, six rather than three parties, links, estates, or stations, as they are alternatively called, came to be generally distinguished: author, editor, publisher, librarian, documentalist (or archivist, or information scientist), and user.And since 1958, also, associations of editors have been formed in various scientific disciplines and geographic regions.Around that year, CBF, the Council of Biology Fditors, was founded in the United States, and in 1964 appeared its European counterpart, ELSE.Eight years later, in 1972, under the auspices of UNESCO, editors and their proliferating associations formed the world information system, UNISIST.Participating in this consortium now are North and South American, European, and Far Eastern societies of earthscience editors; international organizations of the editoVs of chemical, biochemical, physics, mathematics, psychology, and philosophy journals; and,such regional and national groups as those of Nordic, Japanese, French, and German editors, the National and European Science Foundations, and several pri vate companies.A significant aspect of the movement forjeditorial unity was the formation in 1968 of STM, the International Group of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers.At present, STM is composed of about 120 commercial and institutional pub lishing houses in 20 countries.It issues a newsletter and holds semiannual seminars.Since 1972, these editorial and publishing organizations have cooperated and collaborated increasingly, seeking common grounds in matters of style, standards, practices, and philos ophy; trying to loosen clogs in the flow of information and to reduce the cost and waste which result from confusion, redun dant effort, and fragmentation (p.ix).A short-lived but important group in this movement was the informal Association for Scientific Journals which grew from the work of James Lufkin of the Professional Communication

AB  - As biological disciplines extend into the 'big data' world, they will need a names-based infrastructure to index and interconnect distributed data. The infrastructure must have access to all names of all organisms if it is to manage all information. Those who compile lists of species hold different views as to the intellectual property rights that apply to the lists. This creates uncertainty that impedes the development of a much-needed infrastructure for sharing biological data in the digital world. The laws in the United States of America and European Union are consistent with the position that scientific names of organisms and their compilation in checklists, classifications or taxonomic revisions are not subject to copyright. Compilations of names, such as classifications or checklists, are not creative in the sense of copyright law. Many content providers desire credit for their efforts. A 'blue list' identifies elements of checklists, classifications and monographs to which intellectual property rights do not apply. To promote sharing, authors of taxonomic content, compilers, intermediaries, and aggregators should receive citable recognition for their contributions, with the greatest recognition being given to the originating authors. Mechanisms for achieving this are discussed.

AB  - Scholarly communications have been rapidly integrated into digitised and networked open ecosystems, where preprint servers have played a pivotal role in accelerating the knowledge transfer processes. However, quantitative evidence is scarce regarding how this paradigm shift beyond the traditional journal publication system has affected the dynamics of collective attention on science. To address this issue, we investigate the citation data of more than 1.5 million eprints on arXiv (https://arxiv.org/) and analyse the long-term citation trend for each discipline involved. We find that the typical growth and obsolescence patterns vary across disciplines, reflecting different publication and communication practices. The results provide unique evidence on the attention dynamics shaped by the research community today, including the dramatic growth and fast obsolescence of Computer Science eprints, which has not been captured in previous studies relying on the citation data of journal papers. Subsequently, we develop a quantitatively-and-temporally normalised citation index with an approximately normal distribution, which is useful for comparing citational attention across disciplines and time periods. Further, we derive a stochastic model consistent with the observed quantitative and temporal characteristics of citation growth and obsolescence. The findings and the developed framework open a new avenue for understanding the nature of citation dynamics.

Sci-Hub has grown rapidly since its creation in 2011, but the extent of its coverage has been unclear. Here we report that, as of March 2017, Sci-Hub’s database contains 68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and 85.1% of articles published in toll access journals. We find that coverage varies by discipline and publisher, and that Sci-Hub preferentially covers popular, paywalled content. For toll access articles, we find that Sci-Hub provides greater coverage than the University of Pennsylvania, a major research university in the United States. Green open access to toll access articles via licit services, on the other hand, remains quite limited. Our interactive browser at https://greenelab.github.io/scihub allows users to explore these findings in more detail. For the first time, nearly all scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone with an Internet connection, suggesting the toll access business model may become unsustainable.

AB  - We introduce SciWING, an open-source soft-ware toolkit which provides access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models for scientific document processing (SDP) tasks, such as citation string parsing, logical structure recovery and citation intent classification. Compared to other toolkits, SciWING follows a full neural pipeline and provides a Python inter-face for SDP. When needed, SciWING provides fine-grained control for rapid experimentation with different models by swapping and stacking different modules. Transfer learning from general and scientific documents specific pre-trained transformers (i.e., BERT, SciBERT, etc.) can be performed. SciWING incorporates ready-to-use web and terminal-based applications and demonstrations to aid adoption and development. The toolkit is available from http://sciwing.io and the demos are available at http://rebrand.ly/sciwing-demo.

AB  - Semantic tags can enrich citation graphs by inter-connecting papers with citation reasons. One of the best sources of knowledge to tell the reason for citation is the author himself. Integrating these reasons in an authoring system can help authors to choose a reason while citing. We examined various Human and Automatic authoring systems for integration of citation reasons. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such system exists that facilities authors to integrate the reasons while citing. Same is the case with Cite Packages. This research proposes integration of <i>CCRO</i>:Citations&#x2019; Context and Reasons Ontology&#x2019;s (Ihsan and Qadir, 2019) taxonomic hierarchy of reasons within document. We have developed a <i>CCRO</i> Package to semantically tag citations with reasons and to create an intra-discourse relation between research articles. Furthermore, embedding these structures within <i>RDF</i> Data Store enables the creation of knowledge graphs that become a foundation artifact for the Semantic &#x0026; Scientific Discourse.

AB  - Late last year, the news of Elsevier’s acquisition of bepress, the provider of the popular Digital Commons repository platform, sent a shockwave throughout the library community. Hundreds of institutions that use Digital Commons to support their open access repositories quite literally woke up to the news that their repository services are now owned and managed by a company that is well known for its obstruction of open access in the repository space.

AB  - Sedimentologika is a community-driven Diamond Open Access scientific journal for the publication of work in the broad area of sedimentology and stratigraphy. The journal aims to provide a platform to the academic community and broader society, offering and guaranteeing permanent free publication and free access to peer-reviewed scientific studies focusing on all types of sedimentary processes, deposits, and environments across all spatial and temporal scales, on Earth or any other planetary body. It will publish high-quality research that will advance the field of sedimentary science (through multidisciplinarity, new teaching practices, tools and methods, and progress in accessibility to science). Sedimentologika is part of an ongoing broader Diamond Open Access movement in geosciences aspiring freedom from the financial barriers and pressures of private publishing houses, to provide direct and equal access to science for all citizens, scientists, and institutions worldwide. The published material will include research, review, methodology and opinion articles, which will be free to share, as the authors will retain the copyright on all the submitted material. Manuscripts will be published in English. Authors can attach a second abstract in the language of their choice, further allowing local communities, students, or decisional bodies to access, at least, a summary of the latest research, thus reducing potential language barriers. Sedimentologika follows Open Science principles to promote ethical dissemination and accessibility of science and knowledge, following high equity, diversity and inclusion standards. Sedimentologika emerged as a solution for the scientific community to sidestep structural inequality of the academic publishing system that is becoming financially unsustainable to its payers (authors, funding agencies), and to commit to bibliodiversity. The objective is to ensure that scientific findings remain accessible to all in order to keep advancing research and informing society on how we understand sedimentology and stratigraphy in the world around us. Sedimentologika is driven by the academic and scientific community for the community and society, promoting self-governance and adapting to the needs expressed by the community.

AB  - Research data sharing has become an expected component of scientific research and scholarly publishing practice over the last few decades, due in part to requirements for federally funded research. As part of a larger effort to better understand the workflows and costs of public access to research data, this project conducted a high-level analysis of where academic research data is most frequently shared. To do this, we leveraged the DataCite and Crossref application programming interfaces (APIs) in search of Publisher field elements demonstrating which data repositories were utilized by researchers from six academic research institutions between 2012–2022. In addition, we also ran a preliminary analysis of the quality of the metadata associated with these published datasets, comparing the extent to which information was missing from metadata fields deemed important for public access to research data. Results show that the top 10 publishers accounted for 89.0% to 99.8% of the datasets connected with the institutions in our study. Known data repositories, including institutional data repositories hosted by those institutions, were initially lacking from our sample due to varying metadata standards and practices. We conclude that the metadata quality landscape for published research datasets is uneven; key information, such as author affiliation, is often incomplete or missing from source data repositories and aggregators. To enhance the findability, interoperability, accessibility, and reusability (FAIRness) of research data, we provide a set of concrete recommendations that repositories and data authors can take to improve scholarly metadata associated with shared datasets.

AB  - For open access (OA) to become a reality, all stakeholders will need to engage positively with each other to rise to the substantial practical challenges it brings. This means moving beyond advocacy and resistance towards a more mature, evidence-based dialogue that seeks to understand all perspectives and find workable solutions. For research funders, scholarly publication delivers crucial public benefits; funders' OA mandates should be seen as tools for maximizing these benefits. The Higher Education Funding Council for England's (HEFCE) policy for open access in the next Research Excellence Framework (REF) has been put together by listening to all sides of the debate, and its success depends on continuing positive, sensitive and engaged discussions between everyone involved.

AB  - Abstract A study of Thomson‐Scientific ISI ranked Library and Information Science (LIS) journals ( n = 52) is reported. The study examined the stances of publishers as expressed in the Copyright Transfer Agreements (CTAs) of the journals toward self‐archiving, the practice of depositing digital copies of one's works in an Open Archives Initiative (OAI)‐compliant open access repository. Sixty‐two percent (32) do not make their CTAs available on the open Web; 38% (20) do. Of the 38% that do make CTAs available, two are open access journals. Of the 62% that do not have a publicly available CTA, 40% are silent about self‐archiving. Even among the 20 journal CTAs publicly available there is a high level of ambiguity. Closer examination augmented by publisher policy documents on copyright, self‐archiving, and instructions to authors reveals that only five, 10% of the ISI‐ranked LIS journals in the study, actually prohibit self‐archiving by publisher rule. Copyright is a moving target, but publishers appear to be acknowledging that copyright and open access can co‐exist in scholarly journal publishing. The ambivalence of LIS journal publishers provides unique opportunities to members of the community. Authors can self‐archive in open access archives. A society‐led, global scholarly communication consortium can engage in the strategic building of the LIS information commons. Aggregating OAI‐compliant archives and developing disciplinary‐specific library services for an LIS commons has the potential to increase the field's research impact and visibility. It may also ameliorate its own scholarly communication and publishing systems and serve as a model for others.

AB  - The serials literature from 2008 and 2009 reveals the new identity of the serials professional—one who embraces openness. Many forces have pushed the serials profession into a state of flux; among these are the recent economic recession, the evolution of scholarly publishing, and the concept of open systems and data. Chaotic change for serialists has evolved into opportunities to revise collection strategies, approach Big Deal purchasing in new ways, devise creative user-access solutions, and become stakeholders in the debates over scholarly communication. The literature also reveals serials professionals developing a Web 2.0 sensibility. These themes are presented in the review through a discussion of six major topics: sustainability of serials pricing, the future of the Big Deal, management of electronic resources, access, blurring and decline of formats, and Web 2.0.

AB  - Objective – To identify and examine the factors of library publishing services that facilitate scholarly communication.&#x0D; &#x0D; Design – Analysis of library publishing service programs.&#x0D; &#x0D; Setting – North American research libraries.&#x0D; &#x0D; Subjects – Eight research libraries selected from the signatories for the Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity (COPE) Cornell University Library’s Center for Innovative Publishing; Dartmouth College Library’s Digital Publishing Program and Scholars Portal Project; MIT Libraries’ Office of Scholarly Publishing and Licensing; Columbia University Libraries’ Center for Digital Research and Scholarship; University of Michigan Library’s Scholarly Publishing Office; Duke University Library’s Office of Scholarly Communications; University of Calgary Libraries and Cultural Resources’ Centre for Scholarly Communication; and Simon Fraser University Library’s Scholarly Publishing.&#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – The authors used Roosendaal and Geurt’s (1997) four functions of scholarly communication to analyze and categorize library publishing services provided by libraries included in the study. The four functions of scholarly communication include registration, certification, awareness, and archiving.&#x0D; &#x0D; Main Results – Analysis of the registration functions provided by library publishing services in this study revealed three types of facilitating factors: intellectual property, licensing, and publishing. These include services such as repositories for digital scholarly work and research, ISBN/ISSN registration, and digital publishing. Analysis of archiving functions demonstrated that most programs in the study focus on repository-related services in support of digital content preservation of papers, datasets, technical reports, etc. Analysis of certification functions provided by these services exposed a focus on expert review and research support. These include services like professional assessment of information sources, consultation on appropriate literature and information-seeking tools, and writing or copyright advisory services. Analysis of awareness function showed search aids and knowledge-sharing platforms to be the main facilitating factors. These include services like metadata application, schema, and standards or scholarly portals enabling knowledge-sharing among scholars.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion – This study identified several services offered by these library publishing programs which can be categorized as facilitators under Roosendaal and Geurt’s (1997) four functions of scholarly communication. The majority of the libraries in the study treated library publishing services as part of broader scholarly communication units or initiatives. Digital publishing (registration function) was offered by all programs analyzed in the study, while traditional peer-review services (certification function) were not. Widely adopted among programs in the study were the use of social networking tools (awareness function) and self-publishing (archiving function). The authors recommend developing services that facilitate peer review and assert the need to provide a knowledge-sharing mechanism within the academic community that facilitates the scholarly communication process.

AB  - The question of should editors-in-chief (EICs) publish in their own journals has been hotly debated in academic spheres. Some authors have recommended that EICs should refrain from publishing articles in their own journals. They advocate for a &amp;lsquo;publish elsewhere&amp;rsquo; solution. For EICs and journals, a &amp;lsquo;publish elsewhere&amp;rsquo; solution is unjust, unfair, inadequate, and counterproductive. For manuscripts (co) authored by EICs, an alternative solution is to use an open peer review procedure in which reviewers&amp;rsquo; comments are made public alongside EICs/authors&amp;rsquo; responses. An open peer review procedure should make the submission and acceptance dates, the number of revision rounds that EICs&amp;rsquo; articles went through, and the identities of handling editors available to readers and the general public.

AB  - Abstract Open Access (OA) emerged as an important transition in scholarly publishing worldwide during the past two decades. So far, this transition is increasingly based on article processing charges (APC), which create a new paywall on the researchers’ side. Publishing is part of the research process and thereby necessary to perform research. This study analyses the global trends towards paying to perform research by combing observed trends in publishing from 2015 to 2020 with an APC price list. APC expenses have sharply increased among six countries with different OA policies: the USA, China, the UK, France, the Netherlands, and Norway. The estimated global revenues from APC among major publishers now exceed 2 billion US dollars annually. Mergers and takeovers show that the industry is moving towards APC-based OA as the more profitable business model. Research publishing will be closed to those who cannot make an institution or project money payment. Our results lead to a discussion of whether APC is the best way to promote OA.

AB  - The scholarly publishing ecosystem is being forced to adapt following changes in funding, scholarly review, and distribution. Taken alone, each changemaker could markedly influence the entire chain of research consumption. Combining these change forces together has the potential for a complete upheaval in the biome. During the 2019 Charleston Library conference, a panel of stakeholders representing researchers, funders, librarians, publishers, digital security experts, and content aggregators addressed such questions as what essential components constitute scholarly literature and who should shepherd them. The 70-minute open dialogue with audience participation invited a range of opinions and viewpoints on the care, feeding, and safekeeping of peer-reviewed scholarly research. The panelists were: James King, Branch Chief &amp; Information Architect at the NIH; Sharon Mattern Büttiker, Director of Content Management at Reprints Desk; Crane Hassold, Senior Director of Threat Research at Agari; and Susie Winter, Director of Communications and Engagement, Springer Nature. The panel was moderated by Beth Bernhardt, Consortia Account Manager at Oxford University Press. Beth posed questions to the panel and each panelist replied from their vantage point. The lively discussion touched on ideas and solutions not yet discussed in an open forum. Such collaborative approaches are now more essential than ever for shaping the progress of the scientific research community. In attendance were librarians, editorial staff, business development managers, data handlers, library collection managers, content aggregators, security experts and CEOs.

IS  - 2
VL  - 5
AU  - Huard, Linda
C1  - University of Saskatchewan
AB  - As Western post-secondary institutions strive to adequately prepare undergraduate students for an ever-changing world, increased interest and investment has been directed towards the undergraduate learning experience. Listed as a high-impact practice (Kuh 10), undergraduate research, in particular, has been increasingly implemented and expanded in a number of institutions over the past several decades, as shown by the growth of the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR n. pag.). With the rise of undergraduate research culture, the undergraduate research journal (URJ) has emerged. URJs run within a university provide students with the opportunity to enhance their education through exposure to scholarly publishing, develop their research and communication skills, view themselves as content creators, produce higher quality work, and improve their graduate school applications or resumes by building essential skills for the changing job market. Despite the variability present in URJ formats, I have defined two broad categories which URJs fall into. Distinguished as “showcase” and “selective” journals, the two types are differentiated by the implementation of a peer-review process with “showcase” journals publishing papers that have not undergone peer-review and “selective” journals qualifying as scholarly publications. With the intent of providing the maximum benefit to the greatest number of students, a “showcase” journal, without the rigours of peer-review, may appear to be the best fit for achieving this goal as it has the potential to see more student papers published. However, the “selective” showcase journal provides the most cumulative benefits for the student, the institution, and the wider academic community. This is due to experiencing the submission process, which provides students with feedback from reviewers; the prestige of publishing in or housing a high-quality journal; and, growing a discipline’s body of knowledge. While providing any type of publishing platform for undergraduate student work will benefit students, institutions may wish to consider the additional worth of “selective” journals when developing an undergraduate research journal program.

AB  - Peer review is a necessary process with a long history of complaints, including over-solicitation of a small number of reviewers, delays, inadequate numbers of reviewers, and a lack of incentives to provide strong reviews or avoid reviews with little helpful information for the author. In the era of Web-based distribution of research, through working paper or project reports, anonymous peer reviews are much less likely. The Journal of Ocean and Coastal Economics will use signed peer reviews and an open communication process among authors, reviewers, and editors. This approach, to be developed over time, should lead to stronger communication of research results for the Journal's readers.

AB  - Abstract This article presents early results of a research project designed to further our understanding of how to ensure that small scholar‐led journals can survive and thrive in a global open access knowledge commons. This phase of the research focuses on generation of ideas through interviews and focus groups with 15 participants involved in producing small scholar‐led journals that either are or would like to become open access. Although a couple of journals reported that they could survive in an open access future based on existing resources, most were concerned about survival and none expressed confidence that they could thrive in an open‐access future. These journals are far more diverse than one might imagine. Comparing the costs of article production from one journal with another might not make sense. A number of avenues for further research are discussed.

In analyzing changes to the license and technology-based definitions, it tracks shifts in major stakeholders’ perceptions of authorized users and describes developments in licensing and access control technologies. The paper demonstrates that the concept of authorized users has been shaped by a mix of social and technical elements, including changes to information providers’ and libraries’ business models and missions, shifts in norms for license terms, and development of technological tools used to facilitate or constrain access.

AU  - Regala, Jennifer
AB  - Social media has become an integral part of our day-to-day lives. From the early days of chat rooms, MySpace, Friendster, and AOL Instant Messenger, to the countless modern apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram available today, social media has evolved from a basic way to chat with others of similar interests into a viable and effective tool to enhance communication at a professional level. This column will address social media and its use in scholarly publishing, starting with this first column, which will examine whether you and/or your organization want to amplify your group’s messages with one or more of today’s sophisticated social media tools. The first thing you should know about me is that I love my job. As the Managing Editor of The Plant Cell and Plant Physiology at the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB), I love every single thing about my role: overseeing production and peer review, working closely with our extremely capable vendors, figuring out tricky style questions, facilitating the day-to-day operations of our editorial boards, and so much more. However, there has been an unexpectedly delightful and rewarding aspect of my job that has become a passion of mine: social media and using it to promote our authors, our editors, our society, and the plant biology community. Also, social media has played a crucial role in building relationships with my scholarly publishing peers. The ways I use social media professionally continue to evolve and expand in ways I could never have envisioned when […]

AB  - The use of advanced high performance computing tools across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities has rapidly expanded in recent years. Several programs have been initiated under the umbrella of e-science with large-scale funding and a wide range of projects. The vision underlying these programs is that new tools will greatly enhance research and enable new forms of global collaboration. This article maps out the different social science approaches to e-science and provides illustrations of how they have been deployed. The aim is to highlight the diversity of these approaches, show complementarities among them, and point to how they may shape the e-science enterprise in years to come.

The past 18 months, however, have taught us the value of being flexible and creative, not only in scholarly publishing, but in life. Many associations have had to alter standard work protocols to accommodate a virtual workplace and, for some, that has meant adjusting the existing workflow. Now, with vaccinations readily available and offices reopening, it is a good time to revisit best practices for implementing an efficient and effective workflow and figuring out what will work and what to avoid. This session examined different approaches for the development of publishing guidelines, workflow, best practices, and the challenges around implementation from three perspectives: a small-to-midsize society (American Meteorological Society), a large umbrella society (American Heart Association), and a large society that has been very involved in promoting common approaches across multiple societies (American Geophysical Union). Moderator Michael A Friedman, Sr Manager for Publishing Operations at the American Meteorological Society (AMS), a small-to-midsize society located in Boston, approaches this topic considering all the constituencies they serve—academia, the public, the private […]

C1  - Central Economics and Mathematics Institute of RAS, Nakhimovsky 47, Moscow 117418, Russia
AB  - This paper discusses an approach allowing researchers – users of some CRIS – to initiate and maintain scholarly pre-publication communication. The pre-publication communication takes place between authors of some research outputs and researchers who use these outputs on a stage of preparing their own research papers. Such communication is initiated when a researcher who uses CRIS tools is manipulating with a research output text and/or with the text fragments to create his/her own research outputs. In this paper a SocioRePEc CRIS is presented, which is being designed specifically to allow researchers in economics (who belong to a bigger international community of RePEc users) to make experiments with the pre-publication communication. By this, researchers get capacity to use research outputs available at RePEc (metadata and/or full texts in PDF) in so-called "interactive" mode. The discussion explains that this interactive usage mode leads to better adjustment of the researchers' supply and demand, and opens an opportunity for the further wider/deeper research cooperation.

VL  - 62
AU  - Millard, William
AB  - A glut of junk open access journals, pandering to desperate authors driven by the “publish or perish” mantra, is staining the reputation of that new model in scientific and scholarly publishing. Despite the appeal of Stewart Brand's rallying cry “information wants to be free,”1Clarke R. “Information wants to be free.”. Xamax Consultancy/Australian National University, 1994−2009http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/IWtbF.htmlGoogle Scholar the ambiguities of that key term free have long fostered confusion. Does information gravitate toward freedom in the sense of free beer or a free lunch, raising the obvious objection that there is no such thing? The costs of generating and distributing information must be recovered somewhere. Or does freedom in the sense of free speech, unfettered by official censorship, steep access costs, or other artificial constraints, better suit the purposes of scientific communication? Digital distribution has reduced economic bottlenecks in the circulation of research findings and allowed the creation of various structures that offer open access (OA) publication. The Public Library of Science (PLoS), offering 7 peer-reviewed and professionally respected journals (including PLoS One, which has become active in emergency medical research2Greenberg C.J. PLOS ONE: leading emergency medicine journal?.http://openbiomed.info/2012/11/plos-em-journal/Google Scholar), is the best known of the OA entities that have arisen since World Wide Web access reached the general public in the early 1990s. Others include Biomed Central; the British Medical Journal (for research articles, not full content) and its BMJ Open offshoot; Hindawi, a large Cairo-based publisher that has courted controversy but meets most experts' credibility criteria, and that converted all its journals to OA by 2007; and Paul Ginsparg's arXiv.org, which has made self-archiving the norm in physics and commonplace in related disciplines. Supported by assorted mechanisms, including author fees, institutional subsidies, and voluntary or mandatory pay wall–free archiving, OA publishing represents a dramatic step toward an environment in which research information resembles Peter Cooper's ideal of education as a public good, “as free as air or water,” rather than a commodity that can be bought, sold, and restricted to those with the ability to pay. Perhaps inevitably, note observers of the OA movement, enterprises with a sharper eye for authors' wallets than for readers' interests have launched journals that accept practically any article for a fee, perform little or no peer review, and threaten to dilute the credibility of the OA scientific literature, at least in the eyes of the unwary. These on going concerns play on the unfamiliarity of many journals outside specialized communities and the economies of scale inherent in online publishing. The pay-to-publish operations are numerous enough—and enough of a nuisance to researchers, tenure and promotion committees, and scientific communication specialists—to have provoked a watchdog response.3Butler D. Investigating journals: the dark side of publishing.Nature. 2013; 495 (Accessed May 27, 2013): 433-435https://doi.org/10.1038/495433ahttp://www.nature.com/news/investigating-journals-the-dark-side-of-publishing-1.12666Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar The flood tide of suspect publications and related conferences, amounting to “a parallel world of pseudo-academia,” came to the general public's attention last spring through a New York Times article.4Kolata G.

The practice has spread to major subscription publishers as well: Elsevier (Annals of Emergency Medicine's own publisher), Taylor & Francis, John Wiley, and others allow OA to individual articles in perpetuity for a fee, an arrangement known as hybrid OA. Some commentators describe OA as not only a reaction to soaring subscription prices but also nothing less than the future of scientific communication. Yet the movement's quality control mechanisms are under attack during a critical stage in the formation of its institutions and their broader acceptance as a credible alternative to subscription publishing. Jeffrey Beall, scholarly initiatives librarian and associate professor at the University of Colorado Denver's Auraria Library, became concerned about the proliferation of enterprises that he has termed “predatory publishers” while serving as the editor of the Journal of Library Metadata, when he noticed increasing amounts of spam e-mail inviting submissions and positions on editorial boards, often for journals of dubious relevance to his work. He began collecting names of author-fee-supported publishers engaging in these and other questionable practices, posting them on his blog Scholarly Open Access and advising researchers and others to avoid doing business with them. “The scientific article market is flooded with these low-quality journals, many of which haven't gone through an honest peer review,” Beall commented. “They're just polluting scholarly communication.” Beall's list has grown from a small personal project to a more structured instrument with a comments section, publicly posted inclusion criteria,10Beall J. Criteria for Determining Predatory Open-Access Publishers (2nd edition) Scholarly Open Access, 2012.http://scholarlyoa.com/2012/11/30/criteria-for-determining-predatory-open-access-publishers-2nd-edition/Google Scholar and a formal appeal process allowing publishers to rebut the contention that their journals have earned this badge of dishonor. (At least 2 high-volume journal publishers, Dove Medical Press and Hindawi, have been removed after appeal and reanalysis.) Hundreds of organizations and publications have made the list to date by neglecting basic editorial functions (not only peer review but also minimal copyediting), lacking or faking editorial and review board expertise (obscuring their officials' identities or using names without permission), demonstrating a lack of operational transparency, invoicing authors for steep and undisclosed fees after accepting articles and requiring transfer of copyright, letting authors review their own articles under fraudulent online identities, confusing researchers by promoting conferences with names resembling those of respected scientific society events (separated from the recognized conference's name by a single hyphen in one case), plagiarizing material, publishing pseudoscience, and other offenses. “The predatory publishers chiefly operate in the areas where there's grant money,” Beall reported, “so it's the life sciences, for the most part. I can't think of any emergency medicine journals among these publishers … . [I]t's a very specialized topic, and most predatory publishers try to have broad scopes.” The titles of these enterprises are often general, bordering on meaningless, he said, and redundancy is a minimal concern: the list includes 2 firms (one Nigerian, one Ghanaian) using the name International Research Journals and one going by International Research Journal (based in India). Another listed firm, CSCanada (aka Canadian Research and Development Center of Sciences and Cultures), publishes the baffling title Higher Education of Nature Science, instructing prospective authors that “[a]rticles will include advanced knowledge, significant discoveries and the development of nature science at the universities and colleges, designed to lead to critical insights into the areas being addressed.”11Higher Education of Nature ScienceCSCanada [Higher Education of Nature Science Web site].http://www.cscanada.net/index.php/hensGoogle Scholar Beall's mentor William Cohen, founder of the Haworth Press (the Journal of Library Metadata's publisher, now part of the Taylor & Francis Group), described these firms as boiler room–style operations with little incentive to build serious reputations, unlike established publishers in either the subscription or OA realms. Though both Beall and Cohen compare the predatory publishers to vanity presses, the analogy goes only so far. A literary vanity press is a harmless indulgence; the ones on Beall's list introduce unvetted claims into the scientific record on a scale that does nontrivial damage to its credibility. Of the publishing houses targeted by Beall, Cohen said, “each one launches between 1, 2, or 3 to a dozen, several hundred journals each. They just list whole spreadsheets of them all at once. It took me 30 years to launch 200 journals at Haworth; some of these launch 200 in a day.” Arguments that the volume of research being conducted in biomedicine and other fields has expanded enough to require so many new outlets, he added, are “bollocks …. It's well known in publishing that only a small percentage of the journal articles are ever cited or used.” Some commentators see the effect of the junk journals amplified beyond their actual scale. Biophysicist Cameron Neylon, PhD, advocacy director for PLoS, calls them “relatively small operations” but finds that the scammers' conduct means that for OA publishing in general, “everyone gets tarred a bit with the same brush … . There's an awful lot of dodgy behavior happening in subscription space, and people don't seem to pay any attention to that, but that's the nature of being the new people on the block.” The junk publishers, in the PLoS perspective, are “the equivalent of a Nigerian e-mail scam. It's at that level of sophistication in most cases, and it's at that level of obviousness. It's not so much that it's a real problem; it's that it is damaging for the industry as a whole.” Beall recognizes that publicizing the shadow world of predatory publishing makes him a flak magnet. “I think everything that I've done is protected by free speech rights,” Beall said. “I review books, and I write negative and positive book reviews. I see my work with predatory publishers as basically along the same lines. It's just like book reviewing, saying what's good and bad about something. It's just an extension of critical thinking.” Regardless of the salutary effects of this whistle-blowing, however—or the freedom of speech implications—enterprises included on Beall's list have fired warning shots across his bow. A pair of attorneys speaking for the Hyderabad-based OMICS Group recently sent Beall a demand for $1 billion in damages, plus an additional $10,000 fee merely for the alleged cost of preparing this demand itself, alleging that including the firm on his list (where it has been a focus of complaints well beyond Beall's own analyses) was libelous. The threatening letter combines a barrage of intemperate, often ad hominem accusations with nonspecific evaluative defenses of the OMICS Group's quality of work. Another aggrieved party, the Canadian Center of Science and Education, has threatened litigation over the listing of its 4 journals; the owner is a nonscientist Toronto proprietor with a history of involvement in plagiarism.12Brean J. Plagiarized reports from Iranian researchers printed by Canadian publisher.National Post (Toronto). December 3, 2004; (Accessed June 4, 2013)http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/04/iranian-researchers-plagiarized-material/Google Scholar These actions fall under the description of “strategic lawsuits against public participation” (SLAPPs), a common tactic for organizations aiming to silence a critic through fear of high legal expenses. “I've received these before,” Beall responded. “I don't think that … using threatening letters as a business model is very effective in the long run.” Nevertheless, at this writing, his university's legal office is reviewing the threat. He emphatically rejects the contention by OMICS lawyers that his gatekeeping reflects bias against researchers from developing countries, noting that playing the ethnic prejudice card shortchanges the many researchers from those nations whose work appears in legitimate and prestigious journals. “I don't think the western publishers are ignoring scholarship that comes from nonwestern countries,” he commented. “I think they're doing a very good job of attracting the best scholarship, and I think that the scholars in developing countries are just as smart as the scholars in any other country, and they can submit articles that are just as innovative as anybody else can.” Another glaring inaccuracy in the OMICS letter, he noted, is the charge that he wants “to strangle the culture of Open Access publication and would want to propagate the paid access publications.”13Letter from Ashok Ram Kumar and Vijay Kumar, Attorneys, IPmarkets, Hyderabad, India, to Jeffrey Beall, May 14, 2013.Google Scholar Beall has recurrently stated his views that legitimate OA is “a social movement that has changed academic publishing for the better, lowered costs and expanded worldwide access to the latest research”14Beall J. Predatory publishers are corrupting open access.Nature. 2012; 489 (Accessed June 4, 2013): 179https://doi.org/10.1038/489179ahttp://www.nature.com/news/predatory-publishers-are-corrupting-open-access-1.11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar and that he is “not ‘anti’ anything [but] in favor of the best model for scholarly communication, whatever it turns out to be.”15Poynder R. The OA interviews: Jeffrey Beall, University of Colorado Denver Open and shut?, July 11, 2012.http://poynder.blogspot.com/2012/07/oa-interviews-jeffrey-beall-university.htmlGoogle Scholar Stevan Harnad, PhD, professor of cognitive science at the University of Southampton and at Université du Québec à Montréal, founding editor of the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences (an innovator in using open peer commentary), and a recognized OA pioneer, sees such threats as nuisances meant to intimidate through “FUD: fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” The letters to Beall remind Dr. Harnad of threats lodged against British journalist Richard Poynder in 2008 over his investigations into Scientific Journals International, a publisher linked with spamming and an unusual fee structure in which article processing charges varied with the number of authors on an article's byline. Dr. Harnad aided in a legal defense fund for Poynder at the time, though it ultimately wasn't needed. “I don't think anything that Jeffrey has said about them is litigable,” Dr. Harnad continued. “He says, ‘Because of A, B, and C I draw conclusion D,’ and he tells you what A, B, and C are, and those are objective, and conclusion D is his summary of what this means … . Anybody that knows peer review knows that these junk shops are not doing peer review.” Considering the apparent aggressiveness of some of Beall's targets, Cohen described him as “a very brave person to do this … . The only safeguard he's got is, no one's going to go after him; there's nothing to get. He's not rich.” Should the threats proceed to actual litigation in a US, Indian, or Canadian jurisdiction and somehow either succeed—unlikely on a prima facie basis, considering the quality of the claims and, in OMICS' case, the self-parodying amount sought—or, conversely, fail but generate daunting legal costs, a chill could fall over communications about scholarship and pseudoscholarship. Cohen concurred with Dr. Harnad that this, not a billion-dollar windfall, is the real aim of the threats. Proving in court that a publisher's editorial procedures meet or do not meet scientific standards, he said, would be “murky … . There's no universal recognition of acceptable professional peer review.” Because the quality and prestige of journals are vital to academic career assessments, he added, a silencing of Beall's list might also hinder the ability of academic administrators to evaluate researchers' publication records. Here, Beall's efforts complement existing mechanisms and compensate for some of their limitations. Peter Suber, PhD, JD, director of the Harvard Open Access Project, faculty fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, senior researcher at the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, open access project director at Public Knowledge, and research professor of philosophy at Earlham College, noted that quantitative metrics of journal quality such as citation indices, H-indices, or journal impact factors “allow non-experts to judge experts—which is a good thing.” Yet these metrics can be inaccurate and can be gamed. Poor articles, such as the irreproducible, widely disparaged cold-fusion claims of Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann, often have high citation indices because they are repeatedly cited as punching bags. Colleagues engage in log-rolling reciprocal citation, a practice Dr. Suber finds “almost invisible to the world.” Some journals even insist that authors cite other authors from the same journal; “it's unethical, but it happens, and it happens precisely because the impact factor is the coin of the realm.” “Quality is either impossible to measure,” Dr. Suber summarized, “or we haven't figured out how to measure it so far, so we fall back on quantitative parameters that we can measure. It's the contact lens problem: if you lose your contact lens, you look for it under the streetlamp, not because you dropped it there, but because that's where the light is … . I understand why they've turned to the impact factor, but we give it too much weight; we treat it as a quality metric, which it never was.” (He contrasts impact factors with citation systems in law, which count and distinguish citations that approve, disapprove, or overrule the case cited; something similar in scientific scholarship would make partial headway against distorted metrics, though to scale up appropriately, it would require a workforce as diligent as the armies of law students who read and annotate cases.) Lax editorial standards carry more broadly consequential risks, Cohen observed, because scientists are not the only consumers of scientific literature. “The question ‘Who uses and cites journal articles?’ affects public policy,” he said. “Lawyers do, judges do, doctors do, government officials do … congressional committees … a news station. That's what scares me.” In an online publishing environment in which a version of Gresham's Law—the economic principle that a lower-quality currency tends to crowd out a higher-quality currency because the latter is hoarded rather than circulated—appears to apply, Beall's investigations and conclusions provide handy filtering tools. The binary simplicity of the blacklist, however, calls for caveats. “I would distinguish between low-quality journals and dishonest journals,” cautioned Dr. Suber. “They're both problems, but they're separate problems. And the same distinction exists on the subscription side: there are low-quality subscription journals and there are dishonest subscription journals. Some of them are in both categories at the same time. I think Beall's list doesn't distinguish low quality from dishonesty.” The challenge, according to Dr. Suber, is to sort out genuine scam artists from “good-faith startups who aren't trying to deceive or exploit or rip off anybody, but who aren't publishers and don't know the professional standards of publishing. I think for them, the solution is not condemnation or exile, but assistance, especially from publishers who do know the standards of the profession.” A buddy system pairing newcomers with experienced publishers, he suggests, might help startup editors and publishers improve. He expressed a concern that “if the list is not scrupulously assembled, then some innocent publishers will be stigmatized as predatory, and that's a more serious problem than some dishonest ones escaping for the time being.” Beall's list, he speculated, might also serve its purposes well by expanding beyond Beall's own efforts. “Right now, it's Jeffrey Beall's judgment,” Dr. Suber commented, “and his judgment is pretty good, but maybe communal judgment would be better.” Another guide for researchers or readers seeking authentication of unfamiliar journals takes the form of “whitelists”: compendia of reliable OA journals. The traditional criterion for journals, indexing by the former Institute for Scientific Information (ISI, now the Thomson-Reuters Web of Science), is still valuable, but “probably overexacting,” Dr. Harnad said, “because there are probably third world journals that are not indexed by ISI but are still OK.” The expanding OA sector has outpaced this index's growth; the OA community has also shot itself in the foot, Dr. Harnad believes, by “trying to assert itself prematurely.” Claiming “prejudice in favor of the journals that are indexed by ISI and their famous impact factor,” he said, was “one of the stupid things that people who are trying to promote open access said which they shouldn't have said.” He advises beginning researchers to take ISI/Web of Science indexing seriously, avoid the “rah-rah OA” temptation to dismiss that index as behind the times, and aim for “the highest-quality journal whose standards you can meet.” Some junk journals, Cohen added, have made misleading claims about being included in another list, the Directory of Open Access Journals, launched at Lund University in Sweden. This project aims to provide a comprehensive global list of OA journals practicing peer review or editorial quality control, and it is gearing up to perform that function, but according to both Cohen and Dr. Suber, it does not yet have the resources to investigate journals' practices, track them over time, and provide the equivalent of a Good Housekeeping seal. (Some organizations, Cohen added, simply lie about being included there or in familiar services such as MEDLINE, PubMed, or PsycINFO; cross-checking to verify claims is both advisable and time-consuming.) A more rigorous imprimatur, Dr. Suber said, and one not yet on the radar screen for many researchers and physicians, is membership in the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA). This is a professional society based in The Hague, with a code of conduct, a preliminary investigation for prospective members, expulsion procedures if a member fails to comply, and a staff. Dr. Suber, although recommending direct examination of a journal's articles and masthead (perhaps augmented by consultations with informed colleagues) as the best means of evaluation, added that scholars can regard OASPA members as trustworthy. “Now, the problem is the other side,” he cautioned: “if [a publisher] doesn't belong to OASPA, it may not have gotten around to it yet. There's a long tail of open access publishers, hundreds, and most of them don't belong to OASPA yet, but I'd like to create an incentive for all open access publishers to join OASPA and therefore to be bound by this code of conduct … . It's self-regulation by open access publishers. Everything that open access's opponents can say in criticism of predatory journals, basically OASPA has already said.” Cohen suggested 2 other reforms that could help researchers and readers check under the hood: a slight change in standard bibliographic formatting and the creation of “a union list of primary indexing and abstracting services.” If citations to journal articles listed an item's publisher, as well as the journal title, adapting the convention already used for books, junk publishers would be more visible. A regularly updated master list merging the major indexing and abstracting services in different fields would allow authors to “plug in the name of a journal and find out where it is actually indexed, not where a publisher claims it is indexed.” (Ulrich's Periodicals Directory, Cohen reported, attempts to accomplish this, but in his early career, filling out Ulrich's forms, he found that they simply accepted publishers' entries and lacked staff capacity to check them. An effective union list, he speculated, would require “a mammoth effort without producing any income.”) At the opposite end of a scale of rigor and responsibility lies a type of intervention that combines the purposeful subterfuge of Alan Sokal's Social Text hoax16Sokal A.D. Transgressing the boundaries: towards a transformative hermeneutics of quantum gravity.Social Text. 1996; 46/47 (Accessed June 4, 2013): 217-252http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.htmlCrossref Google Scholar, 17Sokal A.D.

Independent researcher Phil Davis, using text-generating software (SCIgen18Stribling J. Krohn M. Aguayo D. SCIgen—an automatic CS paper generator.http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/Google Scholar) that produces grammatically correct but “content-free” articles, fitted out with figures, tables, and references—in other words, gibberish plausibly formatted to resemble research reporting—submitted such an article to a fee-supported journal in computer science, the Open Information Science Journal, which claimed to practice peer review. Despite its nonsensical content and a reference to its imaginary coauthors' institutional affiliation with a Center for Research in Applied Phrenology (CRAP), the article was accepted (with an invoice for an $800 fee).19Davis P. Open access publisher accepts nonsense manuscript for dollars.Scholarly Kitchen.

Computer-generated paper accepted for prestigious technical conference Blog post, io9, December 24, 2008.http://io9.com/5117892/computer+generated-paper-accepted-for-prestigious-technical-conferenceGoogle Scholar Beall and Cohen do not recommend SCIgen-enhanced exposure; it requires outright lying in the standard warrant that an article represents real and original work. Still, they recognize the point behind the pranks: even reputable professional societies, like Homer as Horace described him, sometimes nod. If review standards can occasionally lapse to the point of letting a Schlangemann past the gates, then, a fortiori, organizations that pay lip service or less to peer review require vigilant skepticism. (Humility and full disclosure require a recognition that established publishers, too, make egregious mistakes: Elsevier, Beall noted, let its standards lapse in publishing several pharmaceutical company–sponsored journals in the early 2000s without disclosing the conflict of interest.22Grant B.

PLoS has demonstrated that OA journals can attain high prestige and strong impact metrics without requiring exclusive rights. Though commercial publishers have argued that exclusivity is essential to maintain high editorial standards, PLoS has done so—and made a surplus, Dr. Suber noted; “it's nonprofit; otherwise, we'd say it was making a profit”—while publishing all its content OA.

TI  - ‘SORT BY RELEVANCE’ – WHOSE RELEVANCE? A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF ALGORITHM-MEDIATED ACADEMIC LITERATURE SEARCHES
AU  - Jordan, Katy
C1  - University of Cambridge
AB  - The academic literature has arguably never been more accessible. Through the internet, academics - and the wider public - are presented with an increasing array of platforms which offer sources of academic literature and information sources. Large-scale platforms – such as Google Scholar – often utilise algorithms in order to manage how search query results are prioritised and presented to searchers. This ‘sorting by relevance’ introduces an opaque layer to how readers engage with the literature, with potentially important implications for academic rigour and equity. Academic publishing and citation practices often serve to preserve privilege; in turn, there is a risk that algorithms which draw upon data sources such as these will compound biases. There is a need to interrogate how such algorithms work, and academics’ assumptions about the mechanisms behind them. This paper starts a critical discussion of the issue of algorithm-mediated academic literature searches. First, it draws upon the existing literature – primarily related to Google Scholar. This is followed by a mapping of the use of algorithms across a sample of major academic databases. Algorithms are found to be used extensively, although how they operate varies and is often not clear. The paper concludes with next steps for this project.

AB  - Abstract Journal lists are instruments to categorize, compare, and assess research and scholarly publications. Our study investigates the remarkable proliferation of such journal lists in China, analyses their underlying values, quality criteria and ranking principles, and specifies how concerns specific to the Chinese research policy and publishing system inform these lists. Discouraged lists of “bad journals” reflect concerns over inferior research publications, but also the involved drain on public resources. Endorsed lists of “good journals” are based on criteria valued in research policy, reflecting the distinctive administrative logic of state‐led Chinese research and publishing policy, ascribing worth to scientific journals for its specific national and institutional needs. In this regard, the criteria used for journal list construction are contextual and reflect the challenges of public resource allocation in a market‐led publication system. Chinese journal lists therefore reflect research policy changes, such as a shift away from output‐dominated research evaluation, the specific concerns about research misconduct, and balancing national research needs against international standards, resulting in distinctly Chinese quality criteria. However, contrasting concerns and inaccuracies lead to contradictions in the “qualify” and “disqualify” binary logic and demonstrate inherent tensions and limitations in journal lists as policy tools.

AB  - Open access publishing offers wide benefits to the scholarly community and may also afford relief to financially embattled academic libraries. The progress of the open access model rests upon the acceptance and validation of open access journals and open archives or institutional repositories by the academic mainstream, particularly by publishing researchers. To what extent are the key actors in the South African research system aware of the advantages of open access? This article reports on the findings of a recent survey undertaken to assess the current awareness, concerns and depth of support for open access amongst local researchers, research managers and policy makers in South Africa. The study focuses on issues of quality, article or author charges and the established academic reward system. It concludes that within the prevailing framework, there is little prospect that academics would choose to publish within open access journals. Recommendations for advocacy by the library community are proposed.

AB  - South Africa’s journey into open access publishing is not new, but it has received renewed energy and vigour. The current dominant commercial model of scholarly publishing undermines the production and dissemination of knowledge in science systems such as South Africa’s, first through a hopelessly inequitable higher education and science system with large disparities amongst institutions and because of the increasing unaffordability of the current subscription-based model. This is a description of the approach being adopted to address one part of the quest towards open access scholarly publishing.

AB  - Journal publishing has evolved and changed considerably over the years, leaving many libraries to grapple with analyzing and identifying the purpose and scope of these collections. After numerous discussions and an analysis of how the current print journal collection was being used, Kraemer Family Library at the University of Colorado–Colorado Springs decided to withdraw over 50% of the library’s print journal holdings in order to create a collaborative space for students. This article begins with an overview of journal publishing as it relates to academic libraries and the impact of electronic serials on the scope and purpose of a print journal collection. It then highlights the steps used to complete the project, and communication goals and methods employed to keep library staff members, faculty on campus, and other constituents aware of the changes taking place in the library.

AB  - Spam has become an issue of concern in almost all areas where the Internet is involved, and many people today have become victims of spam from publishers and individual journals. We studied this phenomenon in the field of scholarly publishing from the perspective of a single author. We examined 1,024 such spam e‐mails received by M arcin K ozak from publishers and journals over a period of 391 days, asking him to submit an article to their journal. We collected the following information: where the request came from; publishing model applied; fees charged; inclusion or not in the D irectory of O pen A ccess J ournals ( DOAJ ); and presence or not in Beall's (2014) listing of dubious journals. Our research showed that most of the publishers that sent e‐mails inviting manuscripts were (i) using the open access model, (ii) using article‐processing charges to fund their journal's operations; (iii) offering very short peer‐review times, (iv) on B eall's list, and (v) misrepresenting the location of their headquarters. Some years ago, a letter of invitation to submit an article to a particular journal was considered a kind of distinction. Today, e‐mails inviting submissions are generally spam, something that misleads young researchers and irritates experienced ones.

AB  - The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), a strategic initiative founded by the Association of Research Libraries, is a catalyst for promoting a scholarly communication environment that is more open, financially tenable, and supportive of the current research and information needs of academe. Established in response to imbalances in the scholarly publishing system and the skyrocketing costs of commercial peer-reviewed journals, SPARC is successfully leveraging digital technology and collaboratively finding ways to facilitate the access, sharing and use of scholarly information. This article explores three of SPARC's major programmatic areas (education, incubation, advocacy), and examines how the organization is playing an active role in developing alternate scholarly communication models while constructively influencing public policy in the service of libraries and university communities.

I am titling my presentation Igniting Change in Scholarly Communication, because that is what has happened. When SPARC was formed, Ken Frazier, the engine behind its formation, said that a spark could be two things: something easily extinguished or the cause of a conflagration. We are delighted and proud to say that this SPARC seems to have ignited a conflagration. Your inviting us here to talk about SPARC is evidence of that.

AB  - Evolutionary Ecology Research (EER) and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) have set out to show authors that they have options when it comes to publishing their research -- that by publishing in independent or society-sponsored journals they directly support their own profession. Overall, SPARC aims to create competition for the high priced journals, so that libraries have options when subscription renewals come due. "SPARC and its partners are out to change the landscape of academic publishing," said Rick Johnson, SPARC Enterprise Director. "Scholarly communications will not flourish unless there is an alternative to paying thousands of dollars for a single scientific journal."

AB  - Library faculty at the City University of New York (CUNY) have engaged in promoting and advocating for open access publishing at each of our campuses as well as across the University. Inspired by the passing of a faculty senate resolution in support of the creation of an open access institutional repository and associated policies, many CUNY librarians felt the need to raise their level of commitment. In this article, the authors—four library faculty members and one faculty member from outside the library—share their experiences creating and approving open access policies in the library departments of four CUNY schools and promoting open access beyond the libraries. They offer practical advice and guidance for other librarians and faculty seeking to encourage the embrace of open access publishing in departments or other sub-institutional contexts.

AB  - Background: Advances in the health sciences rely on sharing research and data through publication. As information professionals are often asked to contribute their knowledge to assist clinicians and researchers in selecting journals for publication, the authors recognized an opportunity to build a decision support tool, SPI-Hub: Scholarly Publishing Information Hub™, to capture the team’s collective publishing industry knowledge, while carefully retaining the quality of service.Case Presentation: SPI-Hub’s decision support functionality relies on a data framework that describes journal publication policies and practices through a newly designed metadata structure, the Knowledge Management Journal Record™. Metadata fields are populated through a semi-automated process that uses custom programming to access content from multiple sources. Each record includes 25 metadata fields representing best publishing practices. Currently, the database includes more than 24,000 health sciences journal records. To correctly capture the resources needed for both completion and future maintenance of the project, the team conducted an internal study to assess time requirements for completing records through different stages of automation.Conclusions: The journal decision support tool, SPI-Hub, provides an opportunity to assess publication practices by compiling data from a variety of sources in a single location. Automated and semi-automated approaches have effectively reduced the time needed for data collection. Through a comprehensive knowledge management framework and the incorporation of multiple quality points specific to each journal, SPI-Hub provides prospective users with both recommendations for publication and holistic assessment of the trustworthiness of journals in which to publish research and acquire trusted knowledge.

AB  - To address the complexities researchers face during publication, and the potential community-wide benefits of wider adoption of clear data policies, the publisher Springer Nature has developed a standardised, common framework for the research data policies of all its journals. An expert working group was convened to audit and identify common features of research data policies of the journals published by Springer Nature, where policies were present. The group then consulted with approximately 30 editors, covering all research disciplines within the organisation. The group also consulted with academic editors, librarians and funders, which informed development of the framework and the creation of supporting resources. Four types of data policy were defined in recognition that some journals and research communities are more ready than others to adopt strong data policies. As of January 2017 more than 700 journals have adopted a standard policy and this number is growing weekly. To potentially enable standardisation and harmonisation of data policy across funders, institutions, repositories, societies and other publishers, the policy framework was made available under a Creative Commons license. However, the framework requires wider debate with these stakeholders and an Interest Group within the Research Data Alliance (RDA) has been formed to initiate this process.

AB  - ABSTRACT Library‐led publishing is one of the new approaches to journal publishing and open access that has grown tremendously in the last few years. A 2010 IMLS‐funded survey found that 55% of respondents – from US academic libraries of all different types and sizes – were already implementing or developing a publishing program. Library‐led publishing has garnered such momentum because, by offering low‐ or no‐cost publishing to university scholars, it addresses needs that traditional publishing has not been able to meet. This article presents a series of small case studies to illustrate different journals that have benefited from the library‐publishing model: (i) a journal that struggled to find an affordable publisher in its emerging field; (ii) a small society journal that could no longer afford to support itself in print; (iii) society publications that go beyond the traditional journal format; and (iv) a student journal with a revolving editorial board.

AB  - Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, libraries in the higher education arena had already implemented a combined virtual/real-world service model. Books could be checked out and read in print or online; research assistance could be sought at the reference desk or via instant messaging, email, or phone; and both in-person and remote instruction existed for onsite and offsite classes. However, the pandemic forced the 2020 shutdown, and libraries had to move to a completely online environment. In the public services realm, there was an emphasis on online learning, especially asynchronous learning. The range of knowledge librarians had of online education ran from considerable experience to truly little or none.

AB  - Purpose This paper sets out to review how the business of libraries in higher education has changed with the impact of the digital library during the latest decade of Program, in which the content of the journal swung decisively from being primarily about library management systems to primarily being about digital library issues. Design/methodology/approach An article is taken which typifies the changing emphasis of Program and then the systemic changes underway in libraries are looked at more broadly, placing the digital library in its context of scholarly publishing, higher education policy and user behaviour. Findings The business of libraries is changing, primarily as a result of change in the scholarly publishing industry. Research limitations/implications This is a review article based on a literature review and operational observations. Originality/value The observations build on the author's original work on business planning for digital libraries, and are based on experience of library and information services management in The Netherlands, Belgium and Great Britain.

AB  - In the face of budget challenges, organizational strategy changes, and the new open access (OA) policy, the Pennsylvania State University Libraries (PSUL) are reevaluating negotiations and collections of ‘big deal’ journal packages. While a growing number of libraries are considering cancelling subscriptions to ‘big deals’, PSUL has been taking a careful approach in containing cost and making sure that faculty and students have access to resources that they need. Current efforts include: renegotiating ‘big deals’; cancelling low value titles in title-by-title agreements; obtaining single agreements for the entire Penn State; promoting green OA for future subscription negotiation purposes; and renegotiating OA related licensing terms. To achieve greater efficiency of acquisitions workflows and increase university-wide purchasing power, reallocation of the collection budget will be discussed in the near future. Auto deposit of accepted manuscripts from any Penn State author into ScholarSphere, Penn State’s institutional repository, as well as exploration of other OA models are also under consideration.

The data collected through survey results from fifty-one institutions can inform the strategic decisions being made by other institutions considering an open access policy and illustrates the essential roles that academic libraries can play in the development and passage of open access policies.

AB  - When a journal receives a duplicate publication, the ability to identify the submitted work as previously published, and reject it, is an assay to publication ethics best practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate how three different types of journals, namely open access (OA) journals, subscription-based journals, and presumed predatory journals, responded to receiving a previously published manuscript for review.We performed a quasi-experimental study in which we submitted a previously published article to a random sample of 602 biomedical journals, roughly 200 journals from each journal type sampled: OA journals, subscription-based journals, and presumed predatory journals. Three hundred and three journals received a Word version in manuscript format, while 299 journals received the formatted publisher's PDF version of the published article. We then recorded responses to the submission received after approximately 1 month. Responses were reviewed, extracted, and coded in duplicate. Our primary outcome was the rate of rejection of the two types of submitted articles (PDF vs Word) within our three journal types.We received correspondence back from 308 (51.1%) journals within our study timeline (32 days); (N = 46 predatory journals, N = 127 OA journals, N = 135 subscription-based journals). Of the journals that responded, 153 received the Word version of the paper, while 155 received the PDF version. Four journals (1.3%) accepted our paper, 291 (94.5%) journals rejected the paper, and 13 (4.2%) requested a revision. A chi-square test looking at journal type, and submission type, was significant (χ2 (4) = 23.50, p < 0.001). All four responses to accept our article came from presumed predatory journals, 3 of which received the Word format and 1 that received the PDF format. Less than half of journals that rejected our submissions did so because they identified ethical issues such as plagiarism with the manuscript (133 (45.7%)).Few journals accepted our submitted paper. However, our findings suggest that all three types of journals may not have adequate safeguards in place to recognize and act on plagiarism or duplicate submissions.

AB  - This paper summarizes the 17th Academic Publishing in Europe (APE) Conference: The Future of the Permanent Record, held online from 11 until 13 January, 2022, and organized by the Berlin Institute of Scholarly Publishing (BISP), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing publishers, researchers, funders and policymakers together. The conference consisted of keynote speeches, presentations, and panel discussions on a variety of scholarly communication topics. Main themes were the value of the Version of Record and how to preserve quality and trust in the scholarly record. Collaboration across all stakeholders and high-quality metadata are key, especially when looking at the future where a “record of versions” could exist, connecting all research outputs. Other conference topics involved the threat of paper mills, research integrity and the importance of digital preservation. To ensure trustworthy and high-quality publications, knowledge exchange and cooperation are crucial. Effective partnerships and a multi-perspective approach are key in fostering inclusion, diversity and equity in scholarly communication too. Several speakers stressed the important role publishers play in moving towards an inclusive and trusted Open Science ecosystem, in which data sharing is accelerated and quality assurance and control are implemented across the entire research cycle. To achieve this, new ways of working and new business models need to be developed, and entrepreneurship and innovation encouraged. The 17th APE ended with a session in which five startups showcased their innovative products to advance science.

AB  - This paper summarizes the 18th Academic Publishing in Europe (APE) Conference: Berlin Re-Visited: Building Technological Support for Scholarship and Scientific Publishing, held as a hybrid event 10 and 11 January 2023, and organized by the Berlin Institute of Scholarly Publishing (BISP), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing publishers, researchers, funders, and policymakers together. This year’s conference theme “Out with the old, in with the new!” was discussed and presented in keynote speeches, the APE lecture, and several panel discussions. Current challenges within scholarly publishing, e.g., with research integrity, trust, and research assessment, have much to do with the old ways of doing things. To move science forward, new technologies and innovations, like the decentralized web, FAIR digital objects, and blockchain technology are needed to shape new paradigms. In many sessions it was stressed that not just new technologies are needed to move science forward, but human collaboration and partnerships as well. The changing role of the journal and the importance to recognize more diverse research outputs, beyond the journal article, was a topic of importance. Not only research assessment reforms and improved collaboration amongst different stakeholder groups are needed to address this, new publishing systems, better metadata, and open infrastructures as well. A session presenting different start-ups showcased how Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and software technology can be used to tackle problems in e.g., finding relevant funders and peer reviewers, and detecting image plagiarism. It was also discussed what publishers can do to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Collaboration, data transparency and sharing best practices amongst researchers, funders, and policy makers are key. Another important topic during this year’s APE was how publishers can support Early Career Researchers: establishing new workflows and infrastructures that enable publication of a wider range of research outputs, and broader recognition of these outputs, will incentivize ECRs. This year’s APE was concluded with the APE Award Ceremony. The winner - Vsevolod Solovyov from Prophy - has used AI to enhance the current peer review system and made a very important contribution to improving the scholarly communication system.

AB  - The paper examines and presents the scale and structure of recent (2012–2018) academic publishing in Croatia, with a focus on academic books and journals, the participation of institutions and publishers, scientific fields and disciplines, and invested financial means. As Croatian academic production to a large extent depends on subsidies, the paper is based on the analyses of data from seven years of subventions, which the Croatian Ministry of Sciences and Education allocates to national academic publish­ers, regardless if they are academic institutions or privately owned publish­ers. Conducted analyses provide detailed insight into the model of supply-side academic publishing and into national academic publishing in general. The topics – academic publishing and system of subsidies – have rarely been addressed in recent research. Thus, this paper offers new insights for researchers (e.g. providing knowledge about the scale and structure of academic publishing), provides evaluation possibilities for policymakers (e.g. to design the tools for monitoring and improving the system of public subsidies), and provide comparable perspective for national academic pub­lishing in the context of European academic publishing setting.

AB  - Scholarly communication and publishing are increasingly taking place in the electronic environment. With a growing proportion of the scholarly record now existing only in digital format, serious and pressing issues regarding access and preservation are being raised that are central to future scholarship. At the same time, the desire of scholars to maximize readership of their research and to take control of the scholarly communication process back from the restrictive domain of commercial publishing has prompted the proliferation of access options and experimental models of publishing. This paper examines the emerging trend of university-based institutional repositories (IRs) designed to capture the scholarly output of an institution and to maximize the research impact of this output. The relationship of this trend to the open access movement is discussed and challenges and opportunities for using IRs to promote new modes of scholarship are provided.

AB  - The OA Book Usage Data Trust effort (www.oabookusage.org) is exploring how an International Data Space (IDS) could address issues of trust, data quality, and resource-burdens for OA usage data reporting and analytics. Currently individual libraries, publishers, and scholarly publishing platforms and services must normalize, curate, and aggregate their usage and impact metrics as provided from numerous platforms. While well-resourced organizations may have the time and expertise to curate and aggregate open and privileged usage data across provided COUNTER-compliant and non-COUNTER compliant reports; smaller presses, publishers, and innovative projects often lack the resources necessary to process incoming usage data and benefit from robust OA impact analytics. To address this disparity and improve the quality and interoperability of OA book usage data, OA book publishing stakeholders are exploring how to adopt the international data space (IDS) models and standards. Awarded 1.2Million USD by the Mellon Foundation, a team led by OPERAS, OpenAIRE, the University of North Texas, and Johns Hopkins University are hosting community consultations to determine what data stewardship and security practices are needed to achieve trusted direct usage data exchange at scale.

AB  - College textbook costs increased at three times the rate of inflation between 2002 and 2012 (United States General Accounting Office [GAO], 2013). One solution to high textbook costs is Open Educational Resources (OER) and institutional librarians, because of their reach throughout the institution and particular skillsets, are keenly positioned to make the business case for OER and become leaders of the OER movement. This article discusses the issues most relevant to OER adoption and provides an environmental scan of OER resources currently available to institutions, faculty, and students.

AB  - We posed the question of what services an academic library can best provide to support the NIH Public Access Policy. We approached the answer to this question through education, collaboration, and tool-building. As a result, over the last four years we have engaged over 1,500 participants in discussions of public access to research results, forged alliances with dozens of partners, and built online tools to ease the process of complying with the NIH policy. We conclude that librarians working in collaboration with other key constituencies can have a positive impact on improving access to the results of scientific research.

AB  - Librarians champion the value of openness in scholarship and have been powerful advocates for the sharing of research data. College and university administrators have recently joined in the push for data sharing due to funding mandates. However, the researchers who create and control the data usually determine whether and how data is shared, so it is worthwhile to look at what they are incentivized to do. The current scholarly publishing landscape plus the promotion and tenure process create a “prisoner’s dilemma” for researchers as they decide whether or not to share data, consistent with the observation that researchers in general are eager for others to share data but reluctant to do so themselves. If librarians encourage researchers to share data and promote openness without simultaneously addressing the academic incentive structure, those who are intrinsically motivated to share data will be selected against via the promotion and tenure process. This will cause those who are hostile to sharing to be disproportionately recruited into the senior ranks of academia. To mitigate the risk of this unintended consequence, librarians must advocate for a change in incentives alongside the call for greater openness. Highly-cited datasets must be given similar weight to highly-cited articles in promotion and tenure decisions in order for researchers to reap the rewards of their sharing. Librarians can help by facilitating data citation to track the impact of datasets and working to persuade higher administration of the value of rewarding data sharing in tenure and promotion.

AB  - This essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing, with special attention to the example of Elsevier. A scholarly publisher can be defined as a surveillance publisher if it derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from prediction products, fueled by data extracted from researcher behavior. The essay begins by tracing the Google search engine’s roots in bibliometrics, alongside a history of the citation analysis company that became, in 2016, Clarivate. The essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing by engaging with the work of Shoshana Zuboff, Jathan Sadowski,&amp;nbsp;Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, and Aziz Huq. The recent history of Elsevier is traced to describe the company’s research-lifecycle data-harvesting strategy, with the aim to develop and sell prediction products to unviersity and other customers. The essay concludes by considering some of the potential costs of surveillance publishing, as other big commercial publishers increasingly enter the predictive-analytics business. It is likely,&amp;nbsp;I argue, that windfall subscription-and-APC profits in Elsevier’s “legacy” publishing business have financed its decade-long acquisition binge in analytics. The products’ purpose, moreover, is to streamline the top-down assessment and evaluation practices that have taken hold in recent decades. A final concern&amp;nbsp;is that scholars will internalize an analytics mindset, one already encouraged by citation counts and impact factors. &amp;nbsp;

As background, it outlines the current state of the country's electronic and scholarly publishing, and the development of national and university computer networks. It reviews the project's contribution to introduction of automated library management systems with online catalogues and institutional repositories, and the expansion of journal collections. The issues likely to impact on further developments are discussed. Aspects of current professional education, including a shortage of qualified librarians with contemporary professional knowledge and skills, inhibit development. Other major challenges are the lack of effective strategic planning and poor management systems.

AB  - Purpose Aims at providing a broad overview of some of the issues emerging from the growth in open access publishing, with specific reference to the use of repositories and open access journals. Design/methodology/approach A paper largely based on specific experience with institutional repositories and the internationally run E‐library and information science (LIS) archive. Findings The open access initiative is dramatically transforming the process of scholarly communication bringing great benefits to the academic world with an, as yet, uncertain outcome for commercial publishers. Practical implications Outlines the benefits of the open access movement with reference to repositories and open access journals to authors and readers alike and gives some food for thought on potential barriers to the complete permeation of the open access model, such as copyright restrictions and version control issues. Some illustrative examples of country‐specific initiatives and the international E‐LIS venture are given. Originality/value An attempt to introduce general theories and practical implications of the open access movement to those largely unfamiliar with the movement.

AB  - It is important to keep in mind, though, that first and foremost, faculty seek to disseminate their research as widely as possible, but particularly to their peers.Faculty also seek success in their careers, and recognized research and publication is closely associated with the promotion and tenure process.As STEM librarians, we continually seek ways to support faculty in our liaison areas.OA is one area where we can engage with faculty and is a publishing trend that we as librarians often feel an obligation to discuss.However, concentrating just on OA alone does not take into account that faculty have personal goals with respect to publication, research, teaching, and career advancement.At least some of our success in this OA endeavor comes through our understanding of, and alignment with, their personal professional goals (Burris 2009).Building OA discussions around these professional goals addresses faculty needs and also offers an opportunity to engender a stronger relationship between librarians and faculty.Thiede (2014), in her essay "On Open Access Evangelism," highlights some reservations that arise as we engage faculty in discussion around

AU  - Ross, Sherri

AB  - Electronic Resource Management (ERM) is a specialization that impacts and is impacted by the work of librarians in public services, technical services and systems. All Library and Information Science (LIS) students that wish to work in libraries should have exposure to the concepts and practices of ERM. While LIS programs often convey this knowledge in bits and pieces through existing courses, I believe it is essential to pull this knowledge together into a single course, integrating the various components and providing an overarching perspective on the ERM environment. This presentation conveyed my experience developing an ERM course for the fall semester of 2009. I discussed the combinations of theory, concepts and practice that framed the course and I shared challenges that I encountered. ERM IN PRACTICE AND LIS EDUCATION In 2003, Fisher published an article that posited “the position title of Electronic Resources Librarian has been pre-empted by the public service sector of the profession” (p. 3). It was thought by many at the time that the functions of managing electronic resources would be integrated into the work of existing personnel. As challenges providing technical access to electronic resources arose, systems personnel became involved. As electronic resources proliferated and interfaces evolved, evaluation and selection responsibilities were given to reference and collection development staff. And as licensing terms and pricing schemes became more complex, acquisitions librarians often handled vendor relations and negotiations. ERM management tools have been introduced over the past decade and overall change in the area has slowed, giving libraries to opportunity to more efficiently adapt their organizational structures and workflows to the new environment. Libraries today often have a librarian or team of librarians directly responsible for ERM. Whereas reference and instruction positions may have once included ERM responsibilities, today, ERM positions may include some reference or instruction responsibilities. These inclusions have been declining however. In her study of ERM job announcements from 2000 to 2008, Murdock (2010) noted that “some responsibilities that were considered extraneous to e-resource specific tasks, such as reference service and cataloging, did show an overall declining trend”(p.39). Regardless of the type of library or area of librarianship in which a student may eventually work, she will likely engage in some way with the provision of electronic resources. While new librarians will have the opportunity to learn the specifics of their part in the ERM workflow while on the job, understanding how the work do impacts the work of their colleagues is essential for effective ERM. All students preparing for librarianship would benefit from understanding the big picture of ERM; LIS programs should offer a course dedicated to the subject. Many LIS programs cover this information in bits and pieces through a wide variety of courses, ranging from information organization to reference sources and services. Rarely do students gain knowledge about how the integration of those bits and pieces occurs in practice. This

AB  - This article presents a longitudinal study of global teaching and learning experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study is based on material presented in two articles written 1 year apart from each other by a group of 84 authors from 20 countries. The first article, 'Teaching in the Age of Covid-19', consists of short testimonies and workspace photographs collected between 18 March and 5 May 2020. The second article, 'Teaching in the Age of Covid-19 – One Year Later', consists of short testimonies and workspace photographs collected between 17 March and 31 May 2021. This material is analysed in several different ways. Some parts of the paper treat the testimonies as personal, positional, narratives, while other parts of the paper examine the testimonies for what they represent as data. Readers are invited to read the original testimonies, view the original images and move back and forth between both narratives and data. As narratives, each author has demonstrated their individual postdigital positionality through praxis. As data, these mutually constitutive accounts offer a much larger, powerful commentary, on the position of educators across the globe during this pandemic. The discussion and conclusion blend the two understandings into a postdigital data-narrato-logy, where data and narrative interact in ways similar to interactions between theory and practice within the concept of praxis.

AU  - Horava, Tony
C1  - Tony Horava is associate university librarian (collections) at the University of Ottawa in Ontario, Canada, email: thorava@uottawa.ca
AB  - In recent years, the landscape of collection management has been radically transformed by the explosion of digital content, the importance of collaborative initiatives for content acquisition and shared print management, new licensing and acquisition models, the dramatic shift in facilitating access versus ownership, and a crowded field of providers and platforms. The academic library itself has been utterly changed in the past two decades. What does this mean for the ways in which we teach the next generation of librarians about the activities, goals, and issues involved in collection management? I have taught a collection management course three times, from 2010 to 2012, at the School of Information Studies at the University of Ottawa-Canada. The Master of Information Studies program was established in 2007, and the school is very proud to have received full accreditation from ALA in 2014. A few challenges Expectations of collections work are rapidly changing. As Peggy Johnson has noted, “User expectations about the services, collections, and access that libraries should provide are profoundly affecting collection development and management.” 1 LIS students need to be aware of business practices around e-resources licensing, vendor relations, and consortial dynamics and goals. Moreover, they have to become attuned to the bewildering variety of acquisition models for ebooks and preservation strategies for both ebooks and print books (and other materials), and to understand why these issues are so visceral for libraries. It is also essential for students to understand the impact of networked resources, scholarly publishing and the ever-evolving ecosystem of players in the supply chain, and budget constraints that are becoming tighter each year. With all of this knowledge, however, they need to learn how to stay close to the pulse of their patrons’ needs and expectations. Therefore liaison work and partnership are central to success. The challenge for anyone teaching collection management to LIS students is to articulate the paradigm shift from local collections to a networked and collaborative model, 2

AB  - Academic publishing is in an unstable period of transition. There is a growing degree of anger, especially from early-career academics in a time of austerity, at perceived publisher extortion. The current models of open access do not address all these problems, especially with regard to library budgets. While some of this anger is misplaced, publishers must either self-discipline their practices or find themselves displaced by alternate models. Libraries, likewise, face a dangerous time in which the threat of third-party tender for their services brings extinction ever closer. This article begins to outline a system dubbed the 'Research Output Team' (ROT) that moves publishing in-house to institutional libraries, thereby safeguarding publishing jobs and expertise while defeating the problematic aspects of the existing set-up.

AB  - Abstract When one considers the building blocks of scholarly communication, it is possible to see historical trends forcing them apart into relatively specialized and isolated roles. Today, the entities that are most concerned with professional support of scholarly communication are academic institutions, professional associations, scholarly publishers, and libraries. Each of these faces disconcerting change: in their markets, in their mission, in their revenue streams, in their operational strategies, and in the technology they use to facilitate their work. Simultaneously, the concept of information management is used to reinvent the role of librarians. As a result, knowledge workers in these fields face instability on practical levels, and ambiguity on philosophic levels. The opening address will attempt to describe the conditions of our dilemma and suggest ways for resolving those conflicts, as a preparation for the sessions to follow.

AB  - The TEI Guidelines are developed and curated by a community whose main purpose is to standardize the encoding of primary sources relevant for humanities research and teaching. But other communities are also working with TEI-based publication formats. The first goal of this paper is to raise awareness of the importance of TEI-based scholarly publishing as we know it today. The second goal is to contribute to a reflection on the development of a TEI customization that would cover the whole authoring-reviewing-publishing workflow and guarantee archiving options that are as solid for journal publications as what we now have for primary sources published in TEI.

AB  - Text analytics can be applied in education to gain insights into student learning, teacher performance, and educational trends by analysing various forms of text-based data such as student essays, social media posts, and educational resources. While the need for teacher preparation and training is identified, specific solutions or effective strategies for equipping educators with the skills and knowledge to integrate graphic visualizations into their teaching practices might be underexplored. This Scientometrics study used PRISMA approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) Using R tool. Scopus databases that were relevant to the research topic, and its standardized procedures ensured comprehensiveness and replicability. The study found 85 articles using the PRISMA approach from the Scopus database, with 98.82% being articles and 1.18% from conference proceedings. The number of articles published increased in 2022, with 33 articles, compared to 22 articles in 2020. The total number of cited papers was 70, with a total citation of 969. This indicates an increase in research related to graphic visualization in education due to technological advancements. The citation per cited paper was 119. Besides, the study identifies the top 10 countries that have conducted research in graphic visualization, with the United States leading with 19 studies followed by China with 12 and Spain with 8. The top three subject areas in the current research trends are Computer Science education with 78 publications, Engineering education with 33, and Social Science education with 14. Other fields related to language and linguistics are also being given special attention. These findings suggest that education systems and research in education are keeping up with global developments. There is potential for visualizations to be integrated with AI technologies to provide personalized learning experiences, while ensuring that visualizations are accessible to all students, including those with visual impairments. Studies have shown that using these approaches in education can enhance student learning and understanding of complex concepts.

TI  - Text Recycling in Scientific Writing: What Editors Need to Know
AU  - Isaacson, Ruth
AB  - MODERATOR: Kelly Hadsell Federation of State Medical Boards SPEAKERS: Cary Moskovitz Duke University David Hansen Authors Alliance @DigLibCopyright REPORTER: Ruth Isaacson Genetics Society of America Text recycling has long been a source of confusion for researchers, editors, and publishers and is inappropriately regarded as a form of self-plagiarism. To provide clarity regarding text recycling and consensus about what is ethically and legally acceptable, the Text Recycling Research Project1 (TRRP), a multi-institution, NSF-funded initiative, investigates text recycling in STEM research. TRRP members Cary Moskovitz and David Hansen shared some of the TRRP findings and recommendations. TRRP’s definition of text recycling is as follows: Text Recycling is the reuse of textual material (prose, visuals, or equations) in a new document where (1) the material in the new document is identical to that of the source (or substantively equivalent in both form and content), (2) the material is not presented in the new document as a quotation (via quotation marks or block indentation), and (3) at least one author of the new document is also an author of the prior document.2 Moskovitz explained that in publishing, editors often ask authors to rework their materials in 1 of 3 ways to avoid ethical and legal concerns. While on the surface these appear to be reasonable approaches, Moskovitz detailed why text recycling is often more appropriate. Summarize and Cite Editors may ask authors to paraphrase and cite text when it is recycled from a large block of text. However, when documents are behind paywalls, […]

VL  - 9

C1  - Umeå University,   Sweden
AB  - This article examines the current state of the academic journal. It does so for a number of reasons: the increasing expense of paper journals; the advent of electronic publishing; the use of publication in journals as an indicator of research quality (in addition to disseminating knowledge within a discipline) and consequent criticisms of systems of peer review and evaluation of scholarship; emergent issues of equity and access; and evidence of malpractice. These issues taken together constitute a critique of, and challenge to, the process whereby research papers become journal articles, which has in the past been viewed as unproblematic and straightforward. This paper brings together a wide range of literature in order to inform discussion about the future of the academic journal. It briefly examines the origins of the academic journal and then provides a comprehensive overview of current debates concerning how academic journals work today. In so doing, it raises questions about decisions that will need to be taken regarding the continuity or otherwise of the conventional academic journal, and how publishing practices may change in the future.

IS  - 2
VL  - 67
AU  - Willinsky, John
AB  - This paper sets out the place of the academic library within the digital-era developments of open access to research and scholarship. It analyzes how this development, now that open access is becoming a scholarly norm and common goal for scholarly publishing, is taking two forms, both of which are about making the move, if not a flip, from the subscription model for the circulation of journals to that of open access. The paper sets out the terms and instances of the two paths to open access. The one is a commercialization of open access publishing dominated by the large corporate academic publishers that are pursuing open access on their own terms through the article processing charge (APC) and in relation to the acquisition and development of scholarly communication infrastructure. The other, older tradition, if still on a smaller scale, is one of cooperation and collaboration, growing out of the commons that the library has always represented, involving libraries, journals, and archives, as well as open source tool and platform development. There is some crossover between the two paths, between library consortia and corporate publishers, and this paper encourages librarians to consider how they might take advantage of the market for publishing services that the two paths are creating amid the move to universal open access as a scholarly norm.

C1  - Physics Librarian and Collections Specialist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
AB  - INTRODUCTION The Accessibility Quotient (AQ), a new measure for assisting authors and librarians in assessing and characterizing the degree of accessibility for a group of papers, is proposed and described. The AQ offers a concise measure that assesses the accessibility of peer-reviewed research produced by an individual or group, by incorporating data on open availability to readers worldwide, the degree of financial barrier to access, and journal quality. The paper reports on the context for developing this measure, how the AQ is calculated, how it can be used in faculty outreach, and why it is a useful lens to use in assessing progress towards more open access to research. METHODS Journal articles published in 2009 and 2010 by faculty members from one department in each of MIT’s five schools were examined. The AQ was calculated using economist Ted Bergstrom’s Relative Price Index to assess affordability and quality, and data from SHERPA/RoMEO to assess the right to share the peer-reviewed version of an article. RESULTS The results show that 2009 and 2010 publications by the Media Lab and Physics have the potential to be more open than those of Sloan (Management), Mechanical Engineering, and Linguistics &amp;amp; Philosophy. DISCUSSION Appropriate interpretation and applications of the AQ are discussed and some limitations of the measure are examined, with suggestions for future studies which may improve the accuracy and relevance of the AQ. CONCLUSION The AQ offers a concise assessment of accessibility for authors, departments, disciplines, or universities who wish to characterize or understand the degree of access to their research output, capturing additional dimensions of accessibility that matter to faculty.

IS  - 2
VL  - 9
AU  - Hampson, Crystal
C1  - >University of Saskatchewan
AB  - As a result of changes in scholarly communication created by the open access movement, some academic libraries established open access (OA) publishing funds. OA funds are monies set aside at an institution to fund open access publishing of the results of scholarly research. OA funds are a recent innovation in the type of services offered by academic libraries. Adoption of an innovation can be examined in the light of established theories of innovation adoption among social systems. To examine academic libraries’ responses to OA publishing charges, this article explores the adoption of OA funds among Canadian academic research libraries from 2008 to 2012 by analyzing results from a series of previously published surveys. The findings are then examined in light of Everett Rogers’ Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) to consider the question of whether or not OA funds are becoming a standard service in Canadian academic research institutions. Adoption in Canada is briefly compared to that in the United States and United Kingdom. The paper concludes that, as of 2012, OA funds were becoming common but were not a standard service in Canadian academic research libraries and that libraries were actively participating in the development of OA funding models. Given the current Canadian context, the need of researchers for OA publishing support is likely to create pressure for continued adoption of OA funds among Canadian academic research institutions. However, assessment of existing OA funds is needed.

AB  - Abstract The Arabic Citation Index (ARCI) was launched in 2020. This article provides an overview of the scientific literature contained in this new database and explores its possible usage in research evaluation. As of May 2022, ARCI had indexed 138,283 scientific publications published between 2015 and 2020. ARCI’s coverage is characterized by using the metadata available in scientific publications. First, I investigate the distributions of the indexed literature at various levels (research domains, countries, languages, open access). Articles make up nearly all the documents indexed with a share of 99% of ARCI. The Arts &amp; Humanities and Social Sciences fields have the highest concentration of publications. Most indexed journals are published in Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. About 8% of publications in ARCI are published in languages other than Arabic. Second, I use an unsupervised machine learning model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and the text mining algorithm of VOSviewer to uncover the main topics in ARCI. These methods provide a better understanding of ARCI’s thematic structure. Next, I discuss how ARCI can complement global standards in the context of a more inclusive research evaluation. Finally, I suggest a few research opportunities after discussing the findings of this study.

AB  - As research datasets and analyses grow in complexity, data that could be valuable to other researchers and to support the integrity of published work remain uncurated across disciplines. These data are especially concentrated in the Long Tail of funded research, where curation resources and related expertise are often inaccessible. In the domain of astronomy, it is undisputed that uncurated dark data exist, but the scope of the problem remains uncertain. The Astrolabe Project is a collaboration between University of Arizona researchers, the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure environment, and American Astronomical Society, with a mission to identify and ingest previously-uncurated astronomical data, and to provide a robust computational environment for analysis and sharing of data, as well as services for authors wishing to deposit data associated with publications. Following expert feedback obtained through two workshops held in 2015 and 2016, Astrolabe is funded in part by National Science Foundation. The system is being actively developed within CyVerse, and Astrolabe collaborators are soliciting heterogeneous datasets and potential users for the prototype system. Astrolabe team members are currently working to characterize the properties of uncurated astronomical data, and to develop automated methods for locating potentially-useful data to be targeted for ingest into Astrolabe, while cultivating a user community for the new data management system.

AB  - Bibliometric methods or “analysis” are now firmly established as scientific specialties and are an integral part of research evaluation methodology especially within the scientific and applied fields. The methods are used increasingly when studying various aspects of science and also in the way institutions and universities are ranked worldwide. A sufficient number of studies have been completed, and with the resulting literature, it is now possible to analyse the bibliometric method by using its own methodology. The bibliometric literature in this study, which was extracted from Web of Science, is divided into two parts using a method comparable to the method of Jonkers et al. (Characteristics of bibliometrics articles in library and information sciences (LIS) and other journals, pp. 449–551, 2012: The publications either lie within the Information and Library Science (ILS) category or within the non-ILS category which includes more applied, “subject” based studies. The impact in the different groupings is judged by means of citation analysis using normalized data and an almost linear increase can be observed from 1994 onwards in the non-ILS category. The implication for the dissemination and use of the bibliometric methods in the different contexts is discussed. A keyword analysis identifies the most popular subjects covered by bibliometric analysis, and multidisciplinary articles are shown to have the highest impact. A noticeable shift is observed in those countries which contribute to the pool of bibliometric analysis, as well as a self-perpetuating effect in giving and taking references.

AB  - Authors present a fairly detailed review of main trends as discussed at seminars held within the London Book Fair 2019. As to publishing business in general it is noted that the sales of print are rising for the fourth year in a row. E-book sales are growing in the UK and falling in the US for the second consecutive year (down 3.6% in 2018) while downloadable audiobooks continue to support publishing business with double digit growth in sales (up 37.1% in 2018). Improving technology, especially smart speakers give a boost to audiobook popularity. People are increasingly listening to audiobooks at home in the evening hours of 8pm to 10pm making them an important form of leisure. Audiobooks are in great demand in libraries. Libraries buy them from publishers and audiobooks are primarily circulated in the same way as print books, that is, “one book – one borrower”. In the era of fake news proliferation, quality research findings are important for making informed decisions (for instance, in environmental protection). We need standards and procedures that will help us recognize valid research – like cross-checking, fact checking, tracing the source of information, taking into account whether the material was published in academic or predator journals, journal blacklists and whitelists, differentiation between research and sponsored content.

AB  - We assemble a massive sample of 180,000 CVs of Brazilian academic researchers of all disciplines from the Lattes platform. From the CVs we gather information on key variables related to the researchers and their publications. We find males are more productive in terms of quantity of publications, but the effect of gender in terms of research impact is mixed for individual groups of subject areas. For all fields of science, holding a PhD from abroad increases the chance for a researcher to publish in journals of higher impact. We also find that the more years a researcher takes to finish his or her doctorate, the more likely he or she will publish less thereafter, although in outlets of higher impact. The data also support the existence of an inverted U-shaped function relating research age and productivity.

IS  - 4
AU  - Walker, Dominic
AB  - As a national library, the British Library aims to deliver valuable services to both individual researchers and other research institutions, including those recognised by UK Research and Innovation as ‘Independent Research Organisations’. The British Library’s Scholarly Communications Toolkit is a series of ‘quick start’ guides to important elements of scholarly communications, including open access, research data management, publishing, research impact, and copyright. While addressing internal needs, they have been developed to also meet the needs of external organisations that may not have in-house support for scholarly communications. Being openly licensed and published in multiple formats, they are easily adapted to different contexts of use. This poster outlines the British Library’s approach to supporting scholarly communications both internally and externally, and introduces the series of leaflets which will be publicly available by the date of the 2020 Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing.

AB  - In the UK in June 2012, the Finch Group published its report “Accessibility, Sustainability, Excellence: How to Expand Access to Research Publications.” The Finch Group, with representatives from scholarly publishing and UK academia, agreed that the broad open access is the way of the future and that the preferred path is gold open access. On 16 July 2012, the Research Councils UK unveiled its new open access policy informed by the work of the Finch Group. The policy mandates that research outputs must be published in journals that are compliant with Research Council policy on open access and must use the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY), when an Article Processing Charge (APC) is levied. The Research Council also announced it would provide block grants to eligible UK Higher Education Institutions, support payment of the APCs associated with pay-to-publish.

AB  - The question about the cost of access to scholarly resources is usually answered by focusing on subscription cost. This study highlights the article processing charges (APCs) paid by Canada’s research institution as an additional scholarly resource. Unpaywall database was queried with the DOIs of CARL member universities’ publication indexed in the Web of Science. We find that while Open Access should in principle reduce the cost of access to scholarly literature, we are rather in a situation where both the cost of access and the cost of publishing are increasing simultaneously.

TI  - The Canadian Dollar versus the Collection: How Canadian Academic Libraries are Coping
IS  - 2
VL  - 11
AU  - Scott, David
AU  - Eva, Nicole
C1  - University of Lethbridge
AB  - Through 2015 and into 2016, Canadian academic libraries’ collections budgets were severely strained due to the steady decline of the CAD/USD exchange rate. As most subscription fees for electronic resources (e-resources) are billed in US dollars, the&#x0D; falling value of the Canadian dollar significantly reduced libraries’ purchasing power. This study is based on a survey of the English-speaking member institutions of the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN), a Canadian collections consortium, carried out to determine the impact of the poor exchange rate on collections&#x0D; development and how libraries are coping with new budgetary pressures. Librarians from 33 universities provided survey responses. Of these, 22 participated in telephone interviews to further discuss concerns and ideas regarding the current crisis. The study finds that all participant libraries have taken actions to address the budgetary shortfall, including cancelling serial and database subscriptions, negotiating lower costs with vendors, purchasing fewer monographs, and soliciting additional funding from their&#x0D; institutions. While the financial strain resulting from exchange rate fluctuations is indeed a significant problem for which solutions should be sought, several respondents stressed that it only exacerbates the ongoing inflation of e-resource subscriptions. This deeper and enduring issue, which is expected to outlast the present exchange rate crisis, is enabled by an inherently flawed scholarly publishing system. Thus, librarians engaged in discussions with their wider academic communities concerning collections budgets should not focus exclusively on the exchange rate but should leverage the&#x0D; opportunity to explore alternatives to the current scholarly communication model. If solutions exist, they will likely only be achieved through the support of faculty and university administrators, as well as cooperation among post-secondary institutions and&#x0D; library consortia.&#x0D; &#x0D; Au cours de l’année 2015 et au début 2016, les budgets des collections des bibliothèques universitaires canadiennes ont connu d’importantes restrictions en partie causées par la baisse du dollar canadien face au dollar américain. La plupart des frais d’abonnements aux ressources électroniques sont en dollar américain ce qui signifie que le pouvoir d’achat des bibliothèques a été significativement réduit face à la dévalorisation du dollar canadien. Cette étude utilise un sondage auprès des établissements anglophones qui sont membres du Réseau canadien de documentation pour la recherche (RCDR), un consortium canadien pour les collections, afin de mieux connaître l’impact du faible taux de change sur le développement des collections et sur la façon dont les bibliothèques s’adaptent à de nouvelles pressions budgétaires. Des bibliothécaires de 33 universités ont répondu au sondage. Parmi ceux-ci, 22 ont participé à des entrevues téléphoniques pour discuter davantage de préoccupations et d’idées concernant la crise actuelle. L’étude montre que toutes les bibliothèques participantes ont pris des mesures pour contrer l’insuffisance budgétaire incluant l’annulation d’abonnements de périodiques et de bases de données, la négociation de coûts inférieurs avec les fournisseurs, l’achat de moins de livres ainsi que la sollicitation de financement additionnel auprès de leur institution. Quoique ce stress financier causé par les fluctuations du taux de change représente un sérieux problème pour lequel il faut trouver des solutions, plusieurs répondants ont réitéré que cette réalité ne fait qu’aggraver l’inflation continue des abonnements aux ressources électroniques. Cet enjeu sérieux et persistant, qui risque de perdurer au-delà la crise du taux d’échange actuel, est le résultat d’un système de communication savante défaillant. Les bibliothécaires qui discutent avec leur communauté universitaire au sujet des budgets de collections ne devraient pas se concentrer uniquement sur le taux de change mais devraient en profiter pour explorer des alternatives au modèle de communication savante actuel. Si des solutions existent, elles se réaliseront seulement avec l’appui des professeurs et des administrateurs ainsi qu’avec la coopération entre les établissements postsecondaires et les consortiums des bibliothèques.

AB  - Much of the widespread poverty, environmental desecration, and waste of human life seen around the globe could be prevented by known (to humanity as a whole) technologies, many of which are simply not available to those that need it. This lack of access to critical information for sustainable development is directly responsible for a morally and ethically unacceptable level of human suffering and death. A solution to this general problem is the concept of open source appropriate technology or OSAT, which refers to technologies that provide for sustainable development while being designed in the same fashion as free and open source software. OSAT is made up of technologies that are easily and economically utilized from readily available resources by local communities to meet their needs and must meet the boundary conditions set by environmental, cultural, economic, and educational resource constraints of the local community. This paper explores both the open source and appropriate technology aspects of OSAT to create a paradigm, in which anyone can both learn how to make and use needed technologies free of intellectual property concerns. At the same time, anyone can also add to the collective open source knowledge ecosystem or knowledge commons by contributing ideas, designs, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It is argued that if OSAT continues to grow and takes hold globally creating a vibrant virtual community to share technology plans and experiences, a new technological revolution built on a dispersed network of innovators working together to create a just sustainable world is possible.

IS  - 2
VL  - 7
AU  - Joshi, Y.
C1  - Pune, India
AB  - India continues to account for a large share not only in publishing predatory journals but also in publishing papers in such journals. The sheer number of academics in India, the continued pressure on them to publish, and the country’s capabilities in information technology are the driving forces. Despite sporadic attempts to find acceptable alternatives to using publication metrics for evaluating scientists and academics, the number of papers published by them in journals, a metric usually refined by introducing some measures of the quality of the journals in which the papers are published, continues to be the most widely used criterion for evaluating research performance. This emphasis favours predatory or deceptive journals because they offer rapid publication and usually have more modest article-processing charges. To prospective authors, such journals often appear indistinguishable from legitimate scholarly journals. This article (1) seeks to bridge that gap in knowledge by suggesting some ways of choosing the right journals and pointing out a number of features of predatory or deceptive journals to help authors to identify and avoid those journals; (2) offers a brief overview of measures taken by the authorities in India to curb predatory journals and the practice of publishing papers in such journals; and (3) suggests some novel ways other than publication metrics of assessing researchers.

AB  - The dissemination of research findings in reputable journals is a pride for academics as it offers global visibility on online platforms. The purpose of the research is to examine the challenges academics faced in publishing in high-impact factor journals in Nigeria and the strategies to promote high-impact factor journals. We elicit data from 151 academics from tertiary institutions in Nigeria using Google Forms an online survey comprised of structured and unstructured questionnaires, and data were analyzed using tables, simple percentages, and bar-chart. The research findings show that is impossible to determine the impact factor of all journals and that too much emphasis on impact factors could trigger unethical practices in publishing. The study further shows that high-impact journals have rigorous and thorough peer review processes which make renowned scholars publish their articles due to their high impact. Thus, the articles to be published must be original, indigenous, scientific and of relevance to human development and not just copied and pasted articles. There is a need for funding journal publications and continuous training of academics on the dynamics of publishing quality journal papers. The study concludes that putting in place competent and reputed international scholars and enforcement of the ethics of publication will enhance the standards of Nigerian journals and must be easily accessible online.

AB  - Introduction: This study investigates whether United States university libraries’ commitment to increasing open access (OA) to scholarly outputs as demonstrated by their support of campus level OA policies translates into adoption of OA policies that apply specifically to library employees. Method: This mixed-methods study used an anonymous survey and optional open-ended interviews of schol arly communications librarians at Carnegie Classification Doctoral Universities (Very High Research [R1] and High Research [R2]) to gather information about OA policies or statements at their institutions and/or within their libraries. Results &amp;amp; Discussion: Variation in campus culture and governance structure meant the path from creation to adoption to implementation of a campus and/or library OA policy was similarly varied. The research reveals librarians’ motivations for and contributions to advancement of OA on their campuses, and sometimes also within their libraries. Conclusion: Many of the rationales driving adoption of campus OA policies similarly drive adoption of library-specific OA policies. Those surveyed whose institutions did have library-based OA policies referenced both the importance of leading by example and alignment with institutional mission and values.

AB  - Scholarly publishing is undergoing a transformation that affects every participant in the information chain. Serials used to be a relatively uncomplicated activity, driven by the need of scholars and researchers to publish. Since the early 1980s, both journal price inflation and the growth in the number of journals and the numbers of papers published have outstripped the ability of even the most lavishly funded library to purchase what faculty and students demand. At the same time, modern technology has offered us the opportunity to develop new ways of distributing scholarly literature that offer the researcher facilities and qualities that cannot be undertaken in the print medium

AB  - Abstract The development of the Internet as a scholarly communication tool and the subsequent (apparent) decline of the print journal are causing great changes in historical systems of scientific communication. Not all of these changes have been positive. The two‐decades long “serials crisis” in subscriptions costs, paired with the increasing recognition that copyright management is of vital importance to the flow of information, has prompted many in scholarly communication fields to call for a sea change in how scientists formally share information. At the same time, the Internet offers novel means of transforming scholarly communication beyond the idea of the traditional journal. We are experiencing the birth pangs of this transformation now. Scientists and libraries are faced with many questions surrounding legal, social, and political issues in the scholarly sphere. These include copyright, peer review, tenure and promotion practices, cost, access versus ownership, and archiving. Speakers will discuss those issues in light of projects and new journals being published in a variety of venues, particularly evolutionary ecology and computer science research.

AB  - When the Open Access (OA) movement began at the beginning of the 21st century, librarians and select scholars saw it as a way to level the playing field by disseminating scholarly work freely, by easing the financial burden placed on rising subscription costs, and by offering alternatives to the traditional publishing model. Predatory and opportunistic OA publishers were quick to arrive on the scene, however, leaving faculty and researchers scrambling for a new and updated vetting process for selecting their publication targets. Jeffrey Beall’s blog and Beall’s List, along with other important publication directories, have become an important part of the effort to provide oversight and information to scholars about OA publishers. This paper will discuss OA controversies and review sources and opinions on the transformation of academic publishing efforts in the context of OA issues. Recent trends in librarianship demonstrate the need to educate authors on how to comprehensively research journals before submitting manuscripts to them, how to avoid predatory OA publishers, and where scholarly communication is going in terms of oversight and reputability of OA journals. This paper will briefly summarize many of the possible roles of the librarian, as well as discuss and evaluate the impact of Beall’s List on both the publishing world and librarianship.

AB  - Without peer reviewers, the entire scholarly publishing system as we currently know it would collapse. However, as it currently stands, publishing is an extremely exploitative system, relative to other business models, in which trained and specialized labor is exploited, in the form of editors and peer reviewers, primarily by for-profit publishers, in return for a pat on the back, and a public nod of thanks. This is the “standardized” and “accepted” form for deriving mainstream peer reviewed literature. However, except for open peer review, where reports are open and identities are known, traditional peer review is closed, and the content of peer reports is known only to the authors and editors involved. Publons launched in 2012 as a platform that would offer recognition to peer reviewers for their work. In 2016, Publons rewarded the most productive reviewers with a “Sentinels of Science” award, accompanied by a dismal monetary reward (38 US cents/review) for their efforts. A site aimed at registering pre- and post-publication peer efforts, Publons was perceived as a positive step towards a more transparent peer review system. However, the continued presence of fake peer reviews and a spike in retractions, even among publishers that were Publons sponsors, suggests that perhaps peers may be exploiting Publons to get recognition for superficial or poor peer review. Since all reviews are not public, their content and quality cannot be verified. On 1 June 2017, Clarivate TM Analytics, which owns the journal impact factor—most likely the most gamed non-academic factor in academic publishing—which is a measure of the number of citations of papers in journals, many of which are published by the for-profit publishers—including Publons sponsors—that “employ” free peer reviewers to quality check the literature they then sell for profit, purchased Publons. Touting the purchase as a way to increase transparency, and stamp out fake peer review, some who had supported Publons felt betrayed, even cancelling their Publons accounts immediately when learning of this purchase. Their concerns included the possible “gaming” of peer review as had taken place with the journal impact factor. This commentary examines possible positive and negative aspects of this business transaction, and what it might mean to academics and publishers.

AB  - Academic interlibrary loan practitioners are experiencing changes that can be characterized as either the fragmentation of the resource sharing mission or its evolution into a new form of service routinely making use of new and diverse sources of information outside the scope of past practices. Among these new sources are curated repositories of open access literature, institutional repositories, digital libraries containing scanned public domain literature, and social media article-sharing networking sites. The incorporation of these sources of information into regular workflows presents interlibrary loan practitioners with many challenges. This paper will discuss ways to address these developments.

C1  - Independent researcher
AB  - Four publishing-related organizations, the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA), and the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME), the first being dedicated specifically to the creation and dissemination of ethics policies, established a set of 16 principles related to journal and publisher transparency and “best” publishing practices. The first, second, third and fourth versions were published in 2013, 2015, 2018, and 2022, respectively. Membership of these organizations implies that members can only become such if they satisfy these principles. This paper compares the four versions to appreciate how the content has changed over time, as a historical endeavor to gather how publishing ethics has progressed over time. An assessment is also made to determine whether all principles are related to transparency and best principles, and if any may be missing. We concluded that the 16 principles offer broad guidance to several important aspects related to journal and publishing ethics and management. However, the vast majority are in general excessively broad, occasionally vague, or lack sufficient examples or specifics, despite the slight improvement between versions 3 and 4. We argue further that these weaknesses may limit their practical application. Until September 2022, there was no transparency regarding the consequences for any members that might violate, or not abide by, these principles. In the light of these arguments, we are of the opinion that the 16 principles of “best” publishing practices merit additional improvements.

C1  - UiT The Arctic University of Norway
AB  - The prestige ranking of scholarly journals is costly to science and to society. Researchers’ payoff in terms of career progress is determined largely from where they publish their findings, and less from the content of their scholarly work. This fact creates perverted incentives for the researchers. Valuable research time is spent in trying to satisfy reviewers and editors, rather than spending their time in the most productive direction. This in turn leads to unnecessary long time from research findings are made until they become public. This costly system is upheld by the scholarly community itself. Scholars supply the journals with time, serving as reviewers and editors without any paycheck asked, even though the bulk of scientific journals are published by big commercial enterprises enjoying super profit margins. The super profit results from expensive licensing deals with the scholarly institutions. The free labour offered, on top of the payment for the licensing deals, should be viewed as part of the payment to these publishers – a payment in kind. Why not use this as a negotiating chip towards the publishers? If a publisher asks more than acceptable for a licensing deal, rather than walk away with no deal, the scholarly institutions could pull out all the free labour offered by reviewers and editors.

AB  - Given the rising costs of journal subscriptions and the difficulty that authors have in retaining rights to their own works, reform in the scholarly publishing industry is needed. This article, the first in a two-part series, presents an overview of the crisis in scholarly communication and discusses the groundwork that must be laid in order to develop successful programs to address the crisis on college and university campuses. As the de facto centers of scholarship and research on campus, libraries must educate faculty and advocate for more sustainable publishing models. Programs developed by the Boston Library Consortium and its member institutions are discussed.

VL  - 8
AU  - Neugebauer, Tomasz
AU  - Murray, Annie
C1  - Concordia University
AB  - This paper examines the development of the Open Access movement in scholarly communication, with particular attention to some of the rhetorical strategies and policy mechanisms used to promote it to scholars and scientists. Despite the majority of journal publishersâ€™ acceptance of author self-archiving practices, and the minimal time commitment required by authors to successfully self-archive their work in disciplinary or institutional repositories, the majority of authors still by and large avoid participation. The paper reviews the strategies and arguments used for increasing author participation in open access, including the role of open access mandates. We recommend a service-oriented approach towards increasing participation in open access, rather than rhetoric that speculates on the benefits that open access will have on text/data mining innovation. In advocating for open access participation, we recommend focusing on its most universal and tangible purpose: increasing public open (gratis) access to the published results of publicly funded research. Researchers require strong institutional support to understand the copyright climate of open access self-archiving, user-friendly interfaces and useful metrics, such as repository usage statistics. We recommend that mandates and well-crafted and responsive author support services at universities will ultimately be required to ensure the growth of open access. We describe the mediated deposit service that was developed to support author self-archiving in Spectrum: Concordia University Research Repository. By comparing the number of deposits of non-thesis materials (e.g. articles and conference presentations) that were accomplished through the staff-mediated deposit service to the number of deposits that were author-initiated, we demonstrate the relative significance of this service to the growth of the repository.

TI  - The Crossroads of Embracing Content Management: Using the BeagleBone Black Microcomputer to Host Omeka
IS  - 1
VL  - 5
AU  - Wells, Michael
AU  - Rosenbeck, Craig
AB  - Over the past decade, the technical marketing term "cloud computing" has led users and organizations to enter into contractual agreements that sometimes result in the inappropriate use of content without their knowledge and additional risk for breaches of privacy. These agreements also can end up "vendor locking" organizations into services that take on a subscription model as opposed to true data ownership from self-hosting. While this shift occurred, processors evolved at a pace that allowed the adoption of smartphones which now equal pocket computers. Many smartphones run on the ARM based processor platform, that facilitates powerful processing and relatively low power consumption. With the arrival of the successful ARM processor based, educational microcomputer called the "Raspberry Pi", a whole new market of credit card sized microcomputers has started to flourish. These microcomputers have the capability of running web server applications that can be used in libraries of all sizes. This potential "desktop datacenter" advancement is profound for small libraries like those found in churches and seminaries around the world. With low power consumption, these single board servers give the capability to service areas that have never had the opportunity to host application servers due to unstable electricity. This paper illustrates the use of the single board computing platform named "BeagleBone Black" running Ubuntu Linux, to host the institutional repository application Omeka. This work guides a small library to build an IR site, supporting Dublin Core metadata with Omeka, for under a $200 while assuring complete content ownership.

AB  - Free and open access to primary biodiversity data is essential for informed decision-making to achieve conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development. However, primary biodiversity data are neither easily accessible nor discoverable. Among several impediments, one is a lack of incentives to data publishers for publishing of their data resources. One such mechanism currently lacking is recognition through conventional scholarly publication of enriched metadata, which should ensure rapid discovery of 'fit-for-use' biodiversity data resources.We review the state of the art of data discovery options and the mechanisms in place for incentivizing data publishers efforts towards easy, efficient and enhanced publishing, dissemination, sharing and re-use of biodiversity data. We propose the establishment of the 'biodiversity data paper' as one possible mechanism to offer scholarly recognition for efforts and investment by data publishers in authoring rich metadata and publishing them as citable academic papers. While detailing the benefits to data publishers, we describe the objectives, work flow and outcomes of the pilot project commissioned by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility in collaboration with scholarly publishers and pioneered by Pensoft Publishers through its journals Zookeys, PhytoKeys, MycoKeys, BioRisk, NeoBiota, Nature Conservation and the forthcoming Biodiversity Data Journal. We then debate further enhancements of the data paper beyond the pilot project and attempt to forecast the future uptake of data papers as an incentivization mechanism by the stakeholder communities.We believe that in addition to recognition for those involved in the data publishing enterprise, data papers will also expedite publishing of fit-for-use biodiversity data resources. However, uptake and establishment of the data paper as a potential mechanism of scholarly recognition requires a high degree of commitment and investment by the cross-sectional stakeholder communities.

IS  - 2
VL  - 67
AU  - Kristof, Cindy
AB  - Both commercial and noncommercial publishing have impacted interlibrary loan and other types of resource sharing, such as patrondriven systems, in a variety of ways. Interlibrary loan has always been a concern of publishers, with the possibility libraries would copy in "such aggregate quantities as to substitute for a subscription to or purchase" of a work (CONTU 1978). Exceptions and limits have been in place in the law and as guidelines for library copying for patrons and interlibrary loan since 1978. However, over the past five decades or so, as traditional print publications, electronic "Big Deals," licensing, and permissions have become increasingly unsustainable for library budgets, the open access (OA) movement has gained acceptance and has influenced resource sharing as well. OA materials are being used to fulfill resource-sharing requests, and researcher behavior may bypass traditional means of resource sharing altogether for greater speed and ease of access. Traditional publishing has found itself at a crossroads with the need to adapt as researchers increasingly accept new models of scholarly communication. There are plenty of moving parts in resource sharing today, and these are explored herein.

VL  - 9

AB  - With the advent of the Internet and online publishing, the notion has arisen that access to the world’s research publications could be made available to one and all for free, presumably by shifting the costs to other places in the value chain and disintermediating publishers, a circumstance called Open Access (OA) publishing. While there are many hopes embedded in this view (lower costs, wider access, etc.), it appears more likely that Open Access will come about not through a revolution in the world of legacy publishing, but through upstart media built with the innate characteristics of the Internet in mind. An unanticipated outcome of this situation will be that the overall cost of research publications will rise, though the costs will be borne by different players, primarily authors and their proxies.

AB  - A survey of Ukrainian scholars on the Ukrainian academic journals' level and their experience in interacting with editiorial boards of academic journals, which are indexed in Web of Science and Scopus, has been conducted in the Ukrainian Scientists Worldwide group on Facebook by filling out the Google form.In total, 296 scientists from different fields took part in the survey.The questionnaire allowed to gather various, often diametrically opposed, thoughts about why scientists publish (do not publish) their articles in journals included to Web of Science or Scopus; what the main reviewers' comments on their articles were; for what reason the Ministry of Education and Science requires scholars to have articles in academic journals included to international databases; who is financing the publication fee; how important the knowledge of foreign languages for the preparation of scientific papers is; how the authors interact with the editors during the editorial and publishing process; what the main researchers' motivation to write scientific articles is; how scholars evaluate the practice, when people who are not actually co-authors of the articles are added as co-authors by agreement; how the authors refer to plagiarism and on the basis of which criteria researchers select a journal for publication.The results of the survey have shown contradictory tendencies of Ukrainian researchers' publication activity.On the one hand, it is a desire to reach the international level, to gain recognition, an attempt to adhere to high standards, to improve own skills.On the other hand, pursuit of quantitative indicators, low motivation, violations of academic integrity, low level of proficiency in the languages of international scientific communication.In pursuit of quantity there is no place for scientific values, such as novelty, uniqueness, informativeness.

AB  - Abstract Over the past decade, megajournals have expanded in popularity and established a legitimate niche in academic publishing. Leveraging advantages of digital publishing, megajournals are characterized by large publication volume, broad interdisciplinary scope, and peer‐review filters that select primarily for scientific soundness as opposed to novelty or originality. These publishing innovations are complementary and competitive vis‐à‐vis traditional journals. We analyze how megajournals ( PLOS One , Scientific Reports ) are represented in different fields relative to prominent generalist journals ( Nature , PNAS , Science ) and “quasi‐megajournals” ( Nature Communications , PeerJ ). Our results show that both megajournals and prominent traditional journals have distinctive niches, despite the similar interdisciplinary scopes of such journals. These niches—defined by publishing volume and disciplinary diversity—are dynamic and varied over the relatively brief histories of the analyzed megajournals. Although the life sciences are the predominant contributor to megajournals, there is variation in the disciplinary composition of different megajournals. The growth trajectories and disciplinary composition of generalist journals—including megajournals—reflect changing knowledge dissemination and reward structures in science.

AB  - When I first began working with electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), the conversation in libraries appeared to revolve around open access and publication embargoes. It seemed to me that the primary task for scholarly communication librarians in this area was to broaden access to graduate research while protecting future publication opportunities for individual authors. As graduate students begin to publish earlier in their careers, the relationship between the doctoral dissertation and scholarly publishing is evolving. Many students now include their own previously published work in a dissertation, requiring instruction in publication contracts and copyright transfer agreements at the point of submission to the graduate school.

AB  - Abstract The Open Access movement seeks to make scholarly, peer-reviewed journal articles freely available to anyone, anywhere over the World Wide Web. There were some very significant developments in the area of Open Access in 2004, including statements by major fund donors in support of Open Access. There are now so many Open Access scholarly journal articles available, that using the resources and related tools is essential for libraries. Libraries can provide more and faster resources for users by supplementing paid resources with Open Access resources. Library resources, such as software that fixes links, commonly named resolvers, are beginning to incorporate Open Access materials and Web searches for Open Access materials. After exhausting traditional resources, interlibrary loan staff members are beginning to include Google searching in their workflow. This article will discuss what Open Access is, the dramatic growth of Open Access, major collections, resources and tools. The article will explore the implications, issues, and leadership opportunities for resource sharing specialists.

AB  - How can an open access publishing and distribution model benefit research in contemporary art? In 2013 Artexte, a non-profit organization dedicated to documenting contemporary art in Canada, launched the e-artexte open access digital repository to offer self-archiving services to publishers, authors and artists in Canadian contemporary art. Although the fine arts community has generally been slow to adopt open access, Canadian contemporary arts publishers, many of whom have small budgets and limited resources, are finding the open access e-artexte repository an effective means of increasing distribution of and access to their publications.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the provision of bibliographic data as an extension of the open source concept. Our particular concern is the sustainability of such endeavors. We describe the RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) project, probably the largest 'open source' bibliographic database. It demonstrates that open-source bibliographic data collection is sustainable.

AB  - Despite the increasing number of women graduating in mathematics, a systemic gender imbalance persists and is signified by a pronounced gender gap in the distribution of active researchers and professors. Especially at the level of university faculty, women mathematicians continue being drastically underrepresented, decades after the first affirmative action measures have been put into place. A solid publication record is of paramount importance for securing permanent positions. Thus, the question arises whether the publication patterns of men and women mathematicians differ in a significant way. Making use of the zbMATH database, one of the most comprehensive metadata sources on mathematical publications, we analyze the scholarly output of ∼150,000 mathematicians from the past four decades whose gender we algorithmically inferred. We focus on development over time, collaboration through coautorships, presumed journal quality and distribution of research topics—factors known to have a strong impact on job perspectives. We report significant differences between genders which may put women at a disadvantage when pursuing an academic career in mathematics.

AB  - Investigates if a relationship exists between motivation and publication productivity of UK academic Information Scientists. A motivational questionnaire survey was performed, and citation analyses undertaken to determine the publication and citation count of the 45 respondents. Demonstrates significant differences in motivational levels and publication counts by age, gender, caring responsibilities and hours spent on research. Concludes that those likely to produce more publications were older males without responsibilities who did 6-15 hours research per week. Discusses the significance of the findings to employers and suggests areas for further research.

AB  - The use of scholarly publications that have not been formally published in e.g. journals is widespread in some fields. In the past they have been disseminated through various channels of informal communication. However, the Internet has enabled dissemination of these un-published and often unrefereed publications to a much wider audience. This is particularly interesting seen in relation to the highly disputed open access advantage as the potential advantage for low visibility publications has not been given much attention in the literature. The present study examines the role of working papers in economics during a 10-year period (1996–2005). It shows that working papers are increasingly becoming visible in the field specific databases. The impact of working papers is relatively low; however, high impact working paper series have citation rate levels similar to the low impact journals in the field. There is no tendency to an increase in impact during the 10 years which is the case for the high impact journals. Consequently, the result of this study does not provide evidence of an open access advantage for working papers in economics.

AB  - Due to the increasing availability of digital content and systems improvements that have accelerated physical delivery, academic libraries are afforded opportunities to more efficiently provide users access to library materials. A theory for efficient provision of information resources, and thus more efficient use of financial resources, was proposed by one of the coauthors in "The Future of Academic Library Materials Expenditures: A Thought Experiment." The strategies on which the theory is based include purchase on demand, library publishing, and improved open access discovery. This article details the theory and then examines IUPUI University Library's experience of implementing strategies based on this theory. The authors analyze the effectiveness of the theory and offer guidance for libraries considering a similar path.

AB  - Limited time and budgets have created a legitimate need for quantitative measures of scholarly work. The well-known journal impact factor is the leading measure of this sort; here we describe an alternative approach based on the full structure of the scholarly citation network. The Eigenfactor Metrics—Eigenfactor Score and Article Influence Score—use an iterative ranking scheme similar to Google’s PageRank algorithm. By this approach, citations from top journals are weighted more heavily than citations from lower-tier publications. Here we describe these metrics and the rankings that they provide.

AB  - This paper reviews a number of recent contributions that demonstrate that a blend of welfare economics and statistical analysis is useful in the evaluation of the citations received by scientific papers in the periodical literature. The paper begins by clarifying the role of citation analysis in the evaluation of research. Next, a summary of results about the citation distributions' basic features at different aggregation levels is offered. These results indicate that citation distributions share the same broad shape, are highly skewed, and are often crowned by a power law. In light of this evidence, a novel methodology for the evaluation of research units is illustrated by comparing the high- and low-citation impact achieved by the US, the European Union, and the rest of the world in 22 scientific fields. However, contrary to recent claims, it is shown that mean normalization at the sub-field level does not lead to a universal distribution. Nevertheless, among other topics subject to ongoing research, it appears that this lack of universality does not preclude sensible normalization procedures to compare the citation impact of articles in different scientific fields.

AB  - L'accés obert (AO) en el sector de l'ensenyament superior a Austràlia ha experimentat una evolució ràpida. Aquest article revisa els avenços en dues àrees relacionades: l'AO a les publicacions de recerca científica, i a les dades obertes. D'una banda, l'AO pot esdevenir un suport als recursos educatius oberts (REO) en la mesura que proporciona accés a la recerca per a l'aprenentatge i l'ensenyament. D'altra banda, un ampli ventall d'actors (que inclou universitats, els seus principals òrgans, organismes públics de finançament de la recerca i altres organitzacions i xarxes que es concentren explícitament en l'AO) es mostren cada vegada més actius en aquests àmbits de diferents maneres. L'AO convida a canviar l' statu quo en tot el sector de l'ensenyament superior, i l'impuls i el dinamisme actuals en aquesta àrea suggereixen que es continuaran produint canvis ràpids i rellevants en el context de l'AO en un futur previsible. Aquest article identifica i analitza també les pràctiques generals, les polítiques i els canvis culturals i les infraestructures derivats de l'evolució de l'AO en l'ensenyament superior a Austràlia, i acaba plantejant diverses qüestions clau relatives al futur de les pràctiques i polítiques en matèria de dades obertes i de recerca d'AO a Austràlia en un marc de creixent interès per l'AO a escala internacional.

AB  - In 2018, RMIT University Library was awarded $5,000 fellowship from Libraries of the Australasian Network (LATN) to investigate opportunities in open educational resources (OER). The reasons behind the application were to advocate and increase the use of OER, increase knowledge and expertise in open licencing, and leverage support, advice and appropriate infrastructure from LATN members. The associated benefits to LATN would include the establishment of an OER community of practice and the development of shared tools and resources to facilitate the uptake of open educational resources at home institutions. This is the story of how the Open Textbook Initiative evolved and how a deliberate campaign to increase awareness and adoption of OER was created. Activities included delivering OER awareness sessions, aligning OER textbooks with selected subject areas, delivering an open textbook forum, with local and international speakers, and creating a savings bank for self-reported OER adoptions. The OER textbook hero program was developed to highlight the teaching challenges faced by academic staff and explore their responses. As a result of this activity, there has been greater visibility of OER and the discussion has evolved from textbook affordability to open educational practices.

Design/methodology/approach The paper conducts a literature review on a range of published (1999‐2005) works to research the background of IRs and to incorporate it with the authors' own experiences. Findings The research findings, involving implementing IRs and specifically the effect on the role of the reference librarian in academic libraries, were found to be not as extensive as expected. Originality/value This paper is intended for those who are involved in developing and promoting IRs. The outcome of the paper is to stimulate thought and to contribute to the dialog on the topic of how IRs impact reference librarian roles and careers.

AB  - In this paper we summarise the lessons learned from the first Swedish Read &amp; Publish agreement: Springer Compact with Springer Nature (2016-07-01 – 2018-12-31). We set out to put the Swedish agreement in an international context and to examine the effects of the agreement regarding economy, publication outcome, administration and researchers’ attitudes and practices in Sweden. Publication data, economic data, as well as survey data from administrative staff and corresponding authors were collected and analysed. Based on the analyses, the advantages and disadvantages of Read &amp; Publish agreements are discussed. The advantages include increase in OA publishing, improved OA workflows and ease for researchers. The disadvantages include the risk of conserving the current system and its associated high costs.

AB  - This paper is based on a panel session on various aspects of the Version of Record (VOR) – the permanent record, held at the APE 2022 Conference. It argues that even with the current possibility of sharing versions and elements of the VOR, such as a preprint, an Author Accepted Manuscript or protocols, the VOR still remains valuable. The scholarly community should continue to protect the VOR and recognise it as an enabler of invention. This way, research can be communicated in more rapid, more open and more diverse ways, enabling readers to access a fuller picture of research.

AB  - Print academic journals are dead. As we watch large metropolitan newspapers fail (as are many small town newspapers), the same economic forces are driving online scholarly publishing. This phenomenon is more than print journals going online. The options available with new low-cost online publishing software and the rise in the ability to use ratings from user generated content suggest more near-term changes are likely. Many of the outcomes are unsettled: the economics of online publishing; the standards for peer review, rank, and tenure; and the very nature of scholarly publishing itself. What is certain, however, is that the economics of online academic publishing—modeled via Anderson’s Long Tail Theory—will make it possible to provide greater access, more collaboration, and, ultimately, improved research and researchers. Universities acting as publishing centers with their e-reserves will be expected to change their faculty evaluations, providing greater academic rewards for those who act as editors, reviewers, and proofreaders within this new born-online and only-online world.

AB  - Key points Concerns about a crisis in monograph publishing date back to at least the 1990s, and for traditional journal publishing at least a decade. Two key trends behind concerns over book and journal models are pressures on funding and the emergence of open access. Despite predictions of a revolution, the academic publishing sector has proved remarkably resilient in adapting to market changes. Whilst showing some support for ‘open science’, even early career researchers remain committed to traditional publishing models. The growth in scholarly collaboration networks and in sharing across traditional boundaries is the more likely disrupter of traditional publishing.

AB  - Science policy promotes open access to research data for purposes of transparency and reuse of data in the public interest. We expect demands for open data in scholarly publishing to accelerate, at least partly in response to the opacity of artificial intelligence algorithms. Open data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), and also trustworthy and verifiable. The current state of open data in scholarly publishing is in transition from 'nice to have' to 'need to have.' Research data are valuable, interpretable, and verifiable only in context of their origin, and with sufficient infrastructure to facilitate reuse. Making research data useful is expensive; benefits and costs are distributed unevenly. Open data also poses risks for provenance, intellectual property, misuse, and misappropriation in an era of trolls and hallucinating AI algorithms. Scholars and scholarly publishers must make evidentiary data more widely available to promote public trust in research. To make research processes more trustworthy, transparent, and verifiable, stakeholders need to make greater investments in data stewardship and knowledge infrastructures.

AB  - For three and a half years, Mr. Weber's firm has been facilitating two-day, highly interactive public workshops on Mapping the Future of Publishing and the information industries. In the past year or so, several new issues and themes have emerged that concern both publishers and users of information, including the personalization of information through modularization or "chunking," and the use of encryption-based metering technology to control and charge for information access and use. Publishers also face critical strategic business issues in migrating from print to electronic publications. This paper explains the workshop process and what participants think about these important issues.

AB  - This study explores possible futures for university-based library publishing services (LPS) and uses scenario planning as its research method. The study posits that the major force in developing LPS is the level of funding from the host university, with the most uncertain factor being whether faculty will adopt LPS. The study participants comprised university library directors, library managers responsible for publishing services, and library association personnel and consultants involved in publishing. Many participants saw collaborating with multiple libraries and other stakeholder organizations to establish publishing cooperatives as essential. Issues discussed include whether university libraries will embrace this role, faculties' level of satisfaction with existing services, divergent disciplinary experiences, opportunism as a mechanism to develop services, technology challenges, international dynamics, traditional vs. new forms of scholarly publishing, and publishing cost considerations.

AB  - The changing system of scholarly communications and scholarly publishing is exciting for some and unsettling for others. As libraries use their resources and actions to shape the system, they seek to create a system that better reflects their priorities and values. But, at the same time, other stakeholders are also acting in the system. How these various forces will interact over time is unknown, but futures thinking offers an approach to identifying and considering a range of possibilities. This preconference was structured as an experiential workshop, in which participants explored approaches to considering the possible futures of scholarly communications and publishing, and then their implications for access, collections, and preservation. Though no specific conclusions could be reached about “the future” of scholarly communications as the emphasis was on exploring tools and techniques, the workshop enabled participants to think critically and creatively about their organizations, the impact of change and trends, and strategic positioning going forward.

AB  - Education is a major force for economic and social wellbeing. Despite high aspirations, education at all levels can be expensive and ineffective. Three Grand Challenges are identified: (1) enable people to learn orders of magnitude more effectively, (2) enable people to learn at orders of magnitude less cost, and (3) demonstrate success by exemplary interdisciplinary education in complex systems science. A ten year ‘man-on-the-moon’ project is proposed in which FuturICT’s unique combination of Complexity, Social and Computing Sciences could provide an urgently needed transdisciplinary language for making sense of educational systems. In close dialogue with educational theory and practice, and grounded in the emerging data science and learning analytics paradigms, this will translate into practical tools (both analytical and computational) for researchers, practitioners and leaders; generative principles for resilient educational ecosystems; and innovation for radically scalable, yet personalised, learner engagement and assessment. The proposed Education Accelerator will serve as a ‘wind tunnel’ for testing these ideas in the context of real educational programmes, with an international virtual campus delivering complex systems education exploiting the new understanding of complex, social, computationally enhanced organisational structure developed within FuturICT.

AB  - Certain open access publishers based on the article processing charges model have found it highly profitable to operate within a gray zone that encompasses both legitimate and predatory publishing practices.In this context, maximum profits can be obtained by adequate combinations of journal acceptance rates and elevated article processing charges.Considering that the gray zone can be particularly challenging to identify and that it poses risks for authors aiming to establish academic carreers, we believe it is important to provide a comprehensive description of it.

AB  - Predatory publishing (PP) is a growing challenge since the emergence of an online and openaccess publishing model 1 .The term PP was first coined in 2010 by Jeffrey Beall who explained that the mission of predatory publishers was "to exploit the author-pays, open-access model for their own profit" 1:15 .Publishing in predatory journals is becoming an industry that threatens the integrity of scientific discovery and scholarship 2 .PP not only wastes funding and other resources 3 , but it is also detrimental to authors' reputation and careers.It impedes meaningful knowledge dissemination due to the fact that information published in predatory journals may not be credible or reliable 4 .This is a cause for concern to nursing and the biomedical sciences when PP is cited in legitimate journals [5][6] or when they are included in evidence syntheses published in legitimate journals 7 .Such citations have the potential of altering results 7 and/or impacting patient care 8 .Of concern, the number of predatory journals continues to increase across disciplines 9 with 'no signs of slowing' -Cabells Scholarly Analytics list of suspected predatory journals includes 17,000 journal titles! 10 Although much has been written about PP, there continues to be a notable lack of empirical studies on PP across all disciplines 9 including nursing 4,9 .In this editorial, we highlight best practices for scholarly publishing, discuss current perspectives on PP, and identify strategies to halt submissions to predatory journals.

AB  - In this communication, we look at Open Access (OA) publishing practices in geochemistry. We examine a list of 56 journals and assess whether Article Processing Charges (APCs) and Journal Impact Factors (JIFs) appear to influence publication or not. More than 40% of articles in 2018–2019 were published OA, and about 70% of that portion in fully OA journals. These had a mean APC of US$ 900, whereas the remaining were published in hybrid journals with a higher mean APC of more than $US 1,800. A moderate and positive correlation is found between the number of OA articles published in hybrids journals and their JIF, whereas there is a stronger positive relationship between the number of OA articles published in fully OA journals and the APC. For OA articles published in hybrid journals, it seems that the proportion of OA articles tends to increase in journals with higher JIF.

AB  - In 1947 IFLA signed a cooperation agreement with the newly created UNESCO. This article reviews the evolution of the relationship between IFLA and UNESCO since 1947, and evaluates what this relationship has contributed to the international library and information community. The review falls into three periods: (1) from 1947 to 1977, when IFLA worked closely with UNESCO’s Libraries Division (later the Department of Documentation, Libraries and Archives); (2) from 1977, when the General Information Programme was founded, to 2000, when this Programme was merged with the Intergovernmental Informatics Programme (IIP); and (3) from 2001 to the present time, with particular reference to the UNESCO Information for All Programme (IFAP). As UNESCO gradually shifted its attention away from libraries to documentation and later information society issues, UNESCO’s importance to IFLA as a source of support declined, but possibilities remain for fruitful, mutually beneficial relationships between them.

AB  - The Retraction Watch Database (RWDB) is widely used to retrieve retraction data. However, its lack of affiliation normalization hinders the retrieval efficiency of retraction data for specific research-performing organizations. A query for a university name in the RWDB may yield retraction data entries for other universities with similar names, giving rise to the issue of affiliation naming proximity. This study assessed the impact of this issue on the retrieval efficiency of retraction records for 2,692 Chinese university names in English. The analysis revealed that the retrieval efficiency of retraction records for 206 Chinese university names can be influenced by 408 university names. As of 2022, the retrieval efficiency of retraction records for 96 Chinese university names was compromised by the involvement of 402 university names, resulting in an overall retraction inflation rate of 37.9% and an average rate of 45.0%. The findings highlight the importance of curating retraction data through affiliation-specific queries in the RWDB, adhering to the official English names of Chinese universities for scholarly publishing, and adopting the Research Organization Registry system for affiliation disambiguation. Given the significance of this issue concerning the English names of universities in non-English-speaking countries, the identified causes of the problem and proposed solutions can offer valuable insights for improving the retrieval of retraction records for non-Chinese universities in the RWDB.

AB  - The library technical services units at the Ohio State University Libraries are heavily involved in the operation of the institutional repository. A literature review revealed that the majority of articles addressing the impact of institutional repositories on library operations emphasize the role of public services. In an effort to determine if the Ohio State experience was unusual, a survey was sent to 123 Association of Research Libraries libraries through the Association of Research Libraries directors' listserv. The survey was designed to determine how the management and workload associated with institutional repositories is distributed across the library including whether institutional repository responsibilities are fulfilled in technical services and whether there has been reorganization of technical services to handle the institutional repository. Twenty-one percent of the libraries returned the survey. Most of the institutions indicated that the operation and management of the institutional repository is distributed across multiple units of the library. Most also reported heavy technical services involvement. The fact that 86% of the technical services positions involved in the institutional repository are not new indicates that, in general, technical services units have not been reorganized. Overall, there are many similarities between Ohio State and the institutions responding to our survey. The services for the institutional repository are widely distributed across multiple units of libraries and the institutions in this study reported heavy technical services involvement. However, the involvement of technical services at Ohio State is among the strongest.

AB  - This article seeks to understand how far the United Kingdom higher education (UK HE) sector has progressed towards open access (OA) availability of the scholarly literature it requires to support courses of study. It uses Google Scholar, Unpaywall and Open Access Button to identify OA copies of a random sample of articles copied under the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA) HE Licence to support teaching. The quantitative data analysis is combined with interviews of, and a workshop with, HE practitioners to investigate four research questions. Firstly, what is the nature of the content being used to support courses of study? Secondly, do UK HE establishments regularly incorporate searches for open access availability into their acquisition processes to support teaching? Thirdly, what proportion of content used under the CLA Licence is also available on open access and appropriately licenced? Finally, what percentage of content used by UK HEIs under the CLA Licence is written by academics and thus has the potential for being made open access had there been support in place to enable this? Key findings include the fact that no interviewees incorporated OA searches into their acquisitions processes. Overall, 38% of articles required to support teaching were available as OA in some form but only 7% had a findable re-use licence; just 3% had licences that specifically permitted inclusion in an ‘electronic course-pack’. Eighty-nine percent of journal content was written by academics (34% by UK-based academics). Of these, 58% were written since 2000 and thus could arguably have been made available openly had academics been supported to do so.

AB  - If scholarly communication is broken, how will we fix it? At Impactstory—a non-profit devoted to helping scholars gather and share evidence of their research impact by tracking online usage of scholarship via blogs, Wikipedia, Mendeley, and more—we believe that incentivizing web-native research via altmetrics is the place to start. In this article, we describe the current state of the art in altmetrics and its effects on publishing, we share Impactstory’s plan to build an open infrastructure for altmetrics, and describe our company’s ethos and actions. “Scholarly communication is broken.” We’ve heard this refrain for close to twenty years now, but what does it mean? Academic publishing is still mostly a slow, arduous, and closed process. Researchers have little incentive to experiment with new forms of scholarly communication or make their research freely available at the speed of science, since they’re mainly recognized for publishing journal articles and books: a narrow, very traditional form of scholarly impact. Most arguments attribute academic publishing’s problems to a system that benefits corporate interests or to perverse incentives for tenure and promotion. The solution? Open up research and update our incentive systems accordingly. For too long now, academic publishing has relied on a closed infrastructure that was architected to serve commercial interests. Researchers who attempt to practice open science can find it difficult to get recognition for the impact of open access (OA) publications and research products beyond the journal article, products that include scientific software, data, and so on. Some have already imagined a better future for scholarly communication, one where OA is the norm and a new, open infrastructure serves the diverse needs of scholars throughout the research lifecycle. The decoupled journal is slowly becoming a reality, [1] [#N1] OA publications continue to gain a market share, [2] [#N2] and measuring impact of a diverse set of scholarly outputs through altmetrics is becoming an increasingly common practice for scholars. [3] [#N3] We founded Impactstory with this future in mind. Impactstory [http://impactstory.org] is a non-profit, open source web application that helps researchers gather, understand, and share with others the impact of all their scholarly outputs. We believe that Impactstory and other services that serve scholarly communication are essential to the future of academia. The Imperative for Open Altmetrics http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/idx/j/jep/3336451.0017.301/... 1 of 12 11/3/14, 9:06 PM In this article, we’ll describe the current state of the art in altmetrics and its effects on publishing, share our plan to build an open infrastructure for altmetrics, and describe our company’s ethos and actions. The current publishing ecosystem—and why it needs to be changed Altmetrics—sometimes called “alternative metrics” and defined by Priem, Piwowar, & Hemminger as social media-based metrics for scholarly works [4] [#N4] —are having a major effect on traditional scholarly publishing, but not for all of the reasons you might expect. Traditional academic publishers are masters of vertical integration. Once a manuscript is submitted to a traditional journal for publication, that journal coordinates peer-review, copy-edits, publishes, markets, manages copyright for, and provides scores of other services [5] [#N5] for the published article. In general, this system has done its job relatively well to date—publishing pay-to-read journals. But it has also resulted in a publishing ecosystem that can be harmful to scholars and the public [6] [#N6] : toll access journals with exorbitant subscription fees (as the for-profit publishers seek to expand their ever-widening profit margin [7] [#N7] ) and journal impact factors being used as a proxy for the quality of a published article when evaluating scholars’ work (not the fault of the publishers, to be sure, but they nonetheless contribute to the problem by promoting and sustaining JIF hype). What if we imagined a web-native publishing ecosystem that functioned in an open, networked manner, similar to how much research itself is conducted nowadays? What if we decoupled the services that many journals provide from the journal itself, and had scores of businesses that could provide many of the essential services that authors need, like peer-review, copy editing, marketing—with less overhead and greater transparency? Such a system has the opportunity to foster a scholarly communication environment that benefits scholars and the public, freeing the literature via Open Access publishing, improving the literature through open and post-publication peer review, and understanding the literature’s impact through article-level metrics and altmetrics. Luckily, that new system is in the process of being built. Every day, game-changing publishing services like Publons [https://publons.com/] and Rubriq [http://www.rubriq.com/] (stand-alone peer-review services [8] [#N8] ), Annotum [http://annotum.org/] and PressForward [http://pressforward.org/] (publishing platforms), Dryad [http://datadryad.org/] and Figshare [http://figshare.com/] (data-sharing platforms), and Kudos [https://www.growkudos.com/] (an article marketing service) are debuted. And altmetrics services like Impactstory [https://impactstory.org/] , Altmetric [http://www.altmetric.com/] , PlumX [https://plu.mx/] , and PLOS ALMs [http://article-levelmetrics.plos.org/] are also starting to be widely adopted, by both publishers and scholars alike. The rise of altmetrics Altmetrics are a solution to a problem that increasingly plagues scholars: even in situations where scholarship may be best served by a publishing a dataset, blog post, or other web-native scholarly product, one’s own career is often better served by instead putting that effort into traditional article-writing. If we want to move to a more efficient, web-native science, we must make that The Imperative for Open Altmetrics http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/idx/j/jep/3336451.0017.301/... 2 of 12 11/3/14, 9:06 PM dilemma disappear: what is good for scholarship must become good for the scholar. Instead of assessing only paper-native articles, books, and proceedings, we must build a new system where all types of scholarly products are evaluated and rewarded. The key to this new reward system is altmetrics: a broad suite of online impact indicators that goes beyond traditional citations to measure impacts of diverse products, in diverse platforms, on diverse groups of people. [9] [#N9] Altmetrics leverage the increasing centrality of the Web in scholarly communication, mining evidence of impact across a range of online tools and environments: [/j/jep/images/3336451.0017.301-00000001.jpg] These and other altmetrics promise to bridge the gap between the potential of web-native scholarship and the limitations of the paper-native scholarly reward system. A growing body of research supports the validity and potential usefulness of altmetrics. [10] [#N10] [11] [#N11] [12] [#N12] [13] [#N13] Eventually, these new metrics may power not only research evaluation, but also web-native filtering and recommendation tools. [14] [#N14] [15] [#N15] [16] [#N16] However, this vision of efficient, altmetrics-powered, and web-native scholarship will not occur accidentally. It requires advocacy to promote the value of altmetrics and web-native scholarship, online tools to demonstrate the immediate value of altmetrics as an assessment approach today, and an open data infrastructure to support developers as they create a new, web-native scholarly ecosystem. This is where Impactstory comes in.

AB  - Open Educational Resources (OER) are reducing barriers to education while allowing creators the opportunity to share their work with the world and continue owning copyright of their work. To support new authors and adaptors in the OER space, we provide an overview of common considerations that creators and adaptors of OER should make with respect to issues related to copyright in the context of OER. Further, and importantly, a challenge in the OER space is ensuring that original creators receive appropriate credit for their work, while also respecting the credit of those who have adapted work. Thus, in addition to providing important considerations when it comes to the creation of open access works, we propose shared norms for ensuring appropriate attribution and credit for creators and adaptors of OER.

AB  - Open access (OA) is an alternative business model for the publication of scholarly journals. It makes articles freely available to readers on the Internet and covers the costs associated with publication through means other than subscriptions. This article argues that Gold OA, where all of the articles of a journal are available at the time of publication, is a disruptive innovation as defined by business theorist Clayton Christensen. Using methods described by Christensen, we can predict the growth of Gold OA. This analysis suggests that Gold OA could account for 50 percent of the scholarly journal articles sometime between 2017 and 2021, and 90 percent of articles as soon as 2020 and more conservatively by 2025.

AB  - Examines SHERPA/RoMEO publisher open access (OA) policy information for 100 publishers over a 13 year period (2004–2016) to consider whether their size, type or country (UK or US) affected the development of their OA policy over time. A publisher’s RoMEO colour code, whether they offered a Gold OA option, and the mean number of restrictions as to when, how and where papers may be self-archived, were all mapped. Kruskal–Wallis tests were run to assess whether the differences between their 2004 and 2016 positions were statistically significant. Finds that the growth of Green and Gold OA policy approaches has not been evenly distributed amongst publishers with some significant differences amongst publishers of different size, types and country (UK and US). Large commercial publishers are more likely to be allocated a RoMEO colour code, but at the same time place a high volume of restrictions as to where and how authors might self-archive. Small publishers are less likely to have a RoMEO green colour code, but the volume of restrictions they place on self-archiving are minimal. University presses appear not to be engaging with either OA agenda to any considerable degree. UK and US publishers’ OA policies appear to be influenced by the national OA policy environment which, considering the global nature of the scholarly journals market, was more pronounced than might have been anticipated.

AB  - The use of peer review within both the scholarly communication system and the UK’s Research Assessment Exercise is reviewed. The common denominator is that of peer-reviewed academic journals, since peer review is used by referees to aid publication decisions and by RAE panel members to evaluate a department’s research performance. We propose that since academic research is now subject to peer review at all stages of evaluation, it is becoming an accepted method of rewarding (by funding) research. The growth of electronic publications (both toll-access and open access) provides possibilities for changes to some of the process of peer review and RAE, but the fundamental model of peer review to reduce the number of poor quality publications will remain. The paper concludes that because of the many criticisms of peer review, it is unwise to base funding decisions on second level peer review of articles that have already undergone peer review.

Through an analysis of seven world regions and nine scholarly fields, we found that, while the overall share of open access journals has increased significantly over the last two decades, there are important differences across both the analyzed world regions and disciplines. We also found that, with the exception of neuroscience, the proportion of open access journals is considerably lower among the journals ranked in the Q1 quartile of Scopus than in the general field. We also offer a model that explains the development of open access publishing trends on different disciplinary and geographical levels.

AB  - The intersection of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and open access (OA) is a subject the scholarly publishing community has begun to earnestly grapple with in recent years. The focus is to identify barriers to equitable opportunities, how to better understand which principles of social and racial justice and inclusivity can be applied to promote equitable access to scholarly research and knowledge, and strategies to promote equitable opportunities in scholarly publishing.1 By promoting diverse representation, addressing equity barriers, and fostering inclusive practices, DEI principles can be integrated into OA initiatives to promote a scholarly ecosystem that is accessible to, inclusive of, and representative of all.2 Over the course of a day-and-a-half workshop (February 1–2, 2023) organized by the Ecological Society of America (ESA), with funding from the National Science Foundation and hosted by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington, DC, thought leaders who care deeply about this issue convened to share their perspectives, wrestle with difficult questions, and develop ideas for how to move the community forward in a more unified direction in terms of diversity, equity, inclusion. Diversity, in the context of this workshop, refers to racial and ethnic diversity, gender diversity, and/or other forms of diversity. The following is a summary of the workshop’s presentations, written by 3 members of the Council of Science Editor (CSE) Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Committee who attended the workshop. The goal of this article is to provide those who were not in attendance a general overview of the workshop’s […]

AB  - Science depends on a communication system, and today, that is largely provided by digital technologies such as the internet and web. Despite the fact that digital technologies provide the infrastructure for this communication system, peer-reviewed journals continue to mimic workflows and processes from the print era. This paper focuses on one artifact from the print era, the journal issue, and describes how this artifact has been detrimental to the communication of science, and therefore, to science itself. To replace the journal issue, this paper argues that scholarly publishing and journals could more fully embrace digital technologies by creating digital libraries to present and organize scholarly output.

C1  - Queens College Library, City University of New York, Flushing, New York, USA
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide an alternative method of building quality collections for Jewish Studies collection development professionals in small and medium‐sized academic libraries with highly restricted budgets. Design/methodology/approach Sources of Jewish Studies literary awards were identified and a detailed analysis of awarded books' subjects and the publishing sources was conducted. Findings The results show that awarded books cover a vast variety of subjects of interest to Jewish Studies collections. Since many of them are also published by academic presses, the use of identified Jewish Studies book award sources should be considered by bibliographers responsible for building Jewish Studies collections in non‐sectarian college libraries with very limited budgetary resources. Practical implications The “one stop” access to all award sources and awarded books provides an easy access to otherwise dispersed information. Originality/value The comprehensive list of awards, nominated and winning titles, as well as the subject analysis presented herein, is the first of its kind. This can be used by Jewish Studies bibliographers to build and improve their collections and can also serve as a model for building other interdisciplinary subject collections.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to argue that the traditional scholarly journal system is outdated and in need of revamp, and new internet technologies provide opportunities for change unavailable until now. Design/methodology/approach The four functions of the scholarly journal: registration; awareness; certification; and archiving are discussed in turn and alternative ways of undertaking those functions are explored. Barriers to change and ways to overcome these barriers are addressed. Findings The functions of registration and certification are already met with an open peer review system in place for some high profile journals. Recently developed searching and browsing facilities give academics access to a greater proportion of scholarly literature, providing a more efficient awareness function than traditional journals. The function of archiving is not being adequately addressed by commercial publishers, and the steps being taken by institutional repositories to that end are more sustainable. The fundamental tenet of science as part of the public domain is being eroded by commercial gain, and a move away from the traditional scholarly system can reverse that trend. Barriers to change are: the publisher's commercial imperative to maintain the status quo; the academy's reluctance to change; and the reward system. However, recently both publishers and academics have demonstrated a willingness to try new systems. The barrier of institutional reliance on metrics poses the greatest threat to change. Originality/value This paper builds on an historical background of arguments dating back to 1926, but uses up‐to‐date examples of ways publishers are moving towards change. The paper will inspire debate in the scholarly community.

AB  - Key points Scholarly publishing is unusual because of the substantial involvement of non‐profit organizations and the way in which they work with commercial publishers. Publishing services agreements (PSAs) may provide predictable revenues, access to transformative agreements, and wider distribution. The largest disadvantage of PSAs is publisher lock‐in, where revenues derived from publisher packages are not portable. Deciding to enter a publisher services agreement should not be taken lightly and must be carefully aligned with the society's value and strategy.

IS  - 3-4
VL  - 13
AU  - Bender, Laura
AB  - On September 25, 1999, 80 academic library leaders got together at the American Research Libraries/Online Computer Library Center (ARL/OCLC) Director's Summit in Keystone, Colorado, USA. They challenged themselves to plan for the future of libraries in the digital environment. They all believed that to remain viable in the global economy, libraries and librarians need to assert the underlying values of librarianship as a way to redefine the rules of the playing field in this new environment. An informal working group agreed to write a statement articulating the values of academic libraries and how those values could be reflected in the digital arena. As Carla Stoffle, Dean of University Libraries and the Center of Creative Photography at the University of Arizona states, "We must all become activists, seize the initiative, and gain control of the 'rules' which are now in the hands of others" (Stoffle, 2003). The 'others' are publishers, software producers, information technology professionals, etc. At Keystone participants tackled the following topics: · How to create and support new learning and research environments · How to work creatively with information providers to develop strong responses to needs · How to engage in the changing aspects of teaching and learning in higher education · How to expand their library's knowledge management role within the university · How to connect the values of libraries with the technological environment (Stoffle, 2000). So the Keystone Principles require explicit action based on three specified user-centered principles and twenty-two action items rooted in our values.

C1  - Presenter
AB  - Since its advent more than 15 years ago, the knowledgebase has quietly deposed the catalog as the center of the library management and discovery universe. Knowledgebases provide libraries with an inventory of their e-resources holdings and describe the materials that a library has purchased at a more granular level than the traditional bibliographic record. Knowledgebases power key tools such as link resolvers and unified search platforms, support management needs across the e-resources lifecycle, and more recently have evolved to intersect with areas such as linked open data, community contribution models, and next-generation library management platforms. They have truly become the hub from which our most vital services operate. This report will provide an overview of “The Knowledgebase at the Center of the Universe,” an American Library Association Technology Report assessing the state of knowledgebase technology. Topics covered will include an overview of the current product landscape, an exploration of new directions, and case studies from libraries and vendors using knowledgebases in innovative ways.

AU  - Zlodi, Iva

AB  - (1) Background: Open access to scholarly works is globally recognized as a goal to be achieved as soon as possible; however, there is not yet a general understanding of how to achieve open access for books. In considering the most appropriate models of transition, an accurate and detailed insight into national and regional specifics can be of great importance. The aim of this research is to show the current state of scholarly book publishing in Croatia: recognising the key stakeholders, their characteristics, and the current level of open access to scholarly books. (2) Methods: The existing data from two different sources were used: the data about the public subsidies for book publishers by the Ministry of Science and Education and the data on published books from the Croatian Scientific Bibliography CROSBI, both for the period from 2018 to 2021. (3) Results: In the four-year period, 224 Croatian publishers were awarded subsidies to publish 2359 book titles. The majority of the publishers received support for only a small number of titles and relatively low amounts of subsidies. More than half of the titles are published by small private commercial publishers. However, the uptake of digital publishing among commercial publishers is very modest. Open access to scholarly books is almost entirely in the domain of non-commercial publishers. Most open access titles are available on the websites of their publishers. (4) Conclusions: The analysis of the data from these two sources have resulted in an overview of the current state of book publishing in Croatia. Such an overview provides a good basis for designing future measures and creating a national open science plan and can also be a useful contribution to international discussions.

AB  - In 2000 the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was still in its early stages. It was often still called the Santa Fe Convention, which refers to a meeting in October 1999 of representatives from a number of institutions that maintained or planned e-print archives for open access, and from organizations interested in providing services on the data in those archives (such as search interfaces). This convention was an initiative of Paul Ginsparg, Rick Luce and Herbert Van de Sompel (all three working at that time at the Los Alamos National Laboratory) and it resulted in an agreement about a technical and organizational framework for achieving interoperability among e-print archives. The first European meeting on OAI took place in September 2000 in Lisbon, in conjunction with a meeting of the European Computer Driving Licence Foundation (ECDL), and therefore more oriented to computer specialists than to librarians.

AB  - Library-based publishing efforts are gaining traction in academic and research libraries across the world, primarily in response to perceived gaps in the scholarly publishing system. Though publishing is a new area of work for libraries, it is often a natural outgrowth of their existing infrastructure and skill sets, leveraging the institutional repository as publishing platform and repositioning librarians’ skills as information managers. For decades, these initiatives were primarily ad hoc and local, limiting the potential for library publishing to effect significant change. In 2013, over 60 academic and research libraries collectively founded the Library Publishing Coalition (LPC), a professional association expressly charged with facilitating knowledge sharing, collaboration and advocacy for this growing field. This article offers an overview of library publishing activity, primarily in the US, followed by an account of the creation and mission of the LPC, the first professional association dedicated wholly to the support of library publishers.

AB  - The paper investigates the causal link between remittances and economic growth in Romania. Starting from the debates regarding the relative contribution of international migrants’ remittances to sustainable economic development, this paper proposes an econometric analysis of the effects of remittances on the Romanian economy. The article shows that remittances have a positive effect on the current account of external balance of payments and they can replace external financial assistance flows, including foreign loans. Significant inflows of remittances can offset the current account deficit of the balance of payments, reducing the likelihood balance of payments crisis. At the same time remittances will increase aggregate demand, which has the effect of increasing inflation, currency appreciation and widening trade deficit. We showed also that remittances can exert positive influences on the process of investment, especially through the creation of numerous small enterprises.

AB  - This article examines the current difficulties faced in penetrating the world of scholarly communication technology. While there have been large strides forward in the disintermediation of digital publishing expertise—most notably by the Public Knowledge Project—a substantial number of barriers remain. This paper examines a case study in terms of scholarly typesetting and the Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) standard before moving to suggest three potential solutions: (1) The formation of open, non-commercial and inclusive (but structured) organizations dedicated to the group exploration and standardisation of scholarly publishing technology; (2) The collective authoring of as much technological and process documentation on scholarly publishing as is possible; (3) The modularisation of platforms and agreement on standards of interoperability. Only through such measures is it possible for researchers to reclaim the means of (re)production, for the remaining barriers are not difficult to understand, merely hard to discover.

Scholarly publishing is an important part of, and a prerequisite for progress in research. The advent of the Internet has given options for dramatic changes in the process of publishing and the dissemination of research. This has given the Munin Conferences ample issues to debate over the years, and, most likely, the years to come.

AB  - O n August 25, 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued a memorandum on Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research, also known as the Nelson Memorandum, that significantly alters the open scholarship landscape. The new policy guidance advances previous federal policy in a number of impactful ways. The directive applies to all federal agencies, removes the previous 12-month embargo period on article sharing, directs federal agencies to update their policies on data sharing to enable immediate access to the data underlying published studies, expands the definition of publications, calls for agencies to share publication metadata and to require the use of persistent identifiers (PIDs), and more. The Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS) responded right away, convening members for a virtual briefing by Alondra Nelson, who at the time served as deputy assistant to the president and deputy director for science and society of the White House OSTP, and Christopher Marcum, then-assistant director for open science and data policy at the OSTP. Both contextualized the public access guidance within the Biden Administration’s larger priorities and described how climate change, social inequity, and COVID-19 are compelling, real-world examples of the critical and urgent need for release of data. Additionally, the policy is an important part of upholding and supporting research integrity to protect and restore public trust in scholarship, to help keep track of investments, and maintain accountability through a public record. The Nelson Memorandum offers higher education the opportunity to promote equity and transparency in research through public access compliance. However, colleges and universities are responsible for implementing changes (to infrastructure, policies, training, and more) to comply with new and changing requirements.

AB  - Local conditions in the past often limited opportunities for scholarly exchange. But now these limits are gone and the global workplace has replaced them. It is important to react to these changes. Every academic department must now adopt new methods and rethink processes. Another is the intense national and international debate about open access to scholarly knowledge. The Open Access Initiative shows that a change is taking place in the communication process. This change is also important for service departments within research institutions. Libraries, computer centers and related units have to ask themselves how to react appropriately to the new conditions. What services must be changed or redeveloped, and in what quality and quantity should they be offered? This article focuses on changes in the scholarly publication process. It describes both technological changes and the changes needed in people's attitudes.

AB  - Despite long-standing threats of disruption to scholarly publishing, the community has remained remarkably unchanged over the last two decades. However, underlying this apparent inertia, there is an alternative approach that may emerge over the next few years as known problems move into the foreground, and a number of key social and technical issues are resolved. Furthermore, the industry of science and scientific communication are not isolated from the current economic epoch: collaboration and cost-effectiveness are strong drivers for change. The technological components of this new scholarly universe – natural language processing, semantic technologies such as taxonomies, ontologies and linking – will come together with collaborative innovations inspired by Web 2.0 social media. The final components in recreating a new publishing model are identity and reward, and these are being resolved by the forthcoming Open Research and Contributor ID (ORCID) project and the altmetrics movement respectively.

AB  - The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a public access policy on all publications for which the research was supported by their grants; the policy was drafted in 2004 and took effect in 2008. The policy is now 11 years old, yet no analysis has been presented to assess whether in fact this largest-scale US-based public access policy affected the vitality of the scholarly publishing enterprise, as manifested in changed mortality or natality rates of biomedical journals. We show here that implementation of the NIH policy was associated with slightly elevated mortality rates and mildly depressed natality rates of biomedical journals, but that birth rates so exceeded death rates that numbers of biomedical journals continued to rise, even in the face of the implementation of such a sweeping public access policy.

AB  - Abstract We aim to estimate the total amount of article processing charges (APCs) paid to publish open access (OA) in journals controlled by the five large commercial publishers (Elsevier, Sage, Springer Nature, Taylor &amp; Francis, and Wiley) between 2015 and 2018. Using publication data from WoS, OA status from Unpaywall, and annual APC prices from open data sets and historical fees retrieved via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, we estimate that globally authors paid $1.06 billion in publication fees to these publishers from 2015–2018. Revenue from gold OA amounted to $612.5 million, and $448.3 million was obtained for publishing OA in hybrid journals. Among the five publishers, Springer Nature made the most revenue from OA ($589.7 million), followed by Elsevier ($221.4 million), Wiley ($114.3 million), Taylor &amp; Francis ($76.8 million), and Sage ($31.6 million). With Elsevier and Wiley making most of their APC revenue from hybrid fees and others focusing on gold, different OA strategies could be observed between publishers.

This assumes the free use of scientific information, as long as its authorship is recognized. The three main statements about the OAI are contained in the declarations of Budapest (2002), Bethesda (2003) and Berlin (2003). Open access is compatible with copyright, copyleft, peer review, printing, preservation and other characteristics associated with conventional academic literature. The most relevant difference consists in the fact that readers are not charged for access to the information, and therefore there are no barriers to research. Even so, the success of the OAI does not depend only on the availability of documents, but also on the support of the scientific community.

AB  - It's been just over a decade since the concept of Open Access (OA) first captured the attention of the scientific and scholarly research community, bringing with it the promise and potential of a shining new digital landscape, in which knowledge is freely shared and freely used, and the pace of scientific discovery is accelerated for the benefit of all.Early meetings, convened by diverse groups of thought leaders around the world, resulted in a handful of key Declarations that provided a strong intellectual and philosophical foundation for the movement, and also reflected the convergence of opportunities that allowed scientists to consider a completely new way of sharing information. As the participants in one such key meeting, the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI), noted in 2002:An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good… [1]The tradition referred to by the BOAI is the longstanding practice of scholars to publish papers in journals without expectation of payment; the new technology is, of course, the Internet. The idea that these two elements could be seamlessly combined to ensure that anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world could have the ability to immediately and freely access the results of scholarly research online ignited a firestorm of excitement in many quarters across the academy.Early supporters of the concept quickly recognized its potential to transform the research process. Not only would it allow them to access tens of thousands of articles that were previously unavailable for them to read, but it would also allow them to use these digital articles in previously unimaginable ways. Rather than being constrained to reading one article at a time, hopping from siloed website to siloed website, scholars could now envision a world where articles could be used in bulk and treated as digital data. They would now have the opportunity to download a significant corpus of the literature, run computational or data mining technologies, and facilitate entirely new ways of using scholarly articles.Scholars also recognized the extraordinary potential that OA held for authors to open up their work to vast new audiences across disciplinary and geographic boundaries, offering the chance to gain new readers and allowing significant and measurable increases in the visibility and impact of their work. This increased access also had significant implications outside of research labs, democratizing the ability of educational institutions to access high-quality information and providing a new channel for businesses, entrepreneurs, and interested members of the public—in many cases, for the first time.In the view of many, OA provided a compelling vision of the future of research communication, and one that was ripe with promise. This spurred some early community declarations of support, including a notable petition sponsored by the Public Library of Science (PLOS) that was signed by more than 30,000 individuals who collectively declared their intent to act in support of OA practices [2].With such a compelling vision and with such clear, tangible benefits serving as drivers, a wholesale move to an OA system should have been easy, no? Not quite—as with any significant movement for change where there are significant societal, ethical, and financial outcomes at stake, there is no such thing as an overnight success.Implementing such wholesale changes in the context of traditional scholarly journal publishing proved to be an extraordinarily challenging venture. A complex set of interwoven factors—from copyright transfer routines that indiscriminately transferred limitations from a paper-based world to the digital environment, to evaluation practices that have intimately tied funding, tenure, and promotion decisions to publication in established flagship “high-end” journals, and not to mention the fact that scholarly publishing is a multibillion dollar revenue-generating industry [3] with absolutely no interest in ceding their claim on this layer of content—came at times to resemble a Gordian knot that at times seemed impossible to unravel.Yet, despite these substantial obstacles, over the past decade, we have seen the acceptance and adoption of OA grow, steadily and inexorably, year in and year out. How has this been possible? It's tempting, when writing a retrospective, to simply point to a person or an event (or set of them) and say: these were the catalysts; this was the precipitating event that made it all happen. And while OA, of course, does have its notable leaders and benchmark events, the collective movement has always been greater than the sum of its parts.This was driven home to me at a recent meeting in Mexico City. Public Knowledge Project founder John Willinsky recounted the experiences he'd had a decade ago, traveling throughout Latin America and working to promote the idea of the academic community taking back control of their research output by using OA. “Sometimes there'd be 15 people in the room, and sometimes a few hundred,” he noted. “But I was so sure that at the end of each discussion, all of them would rush up to me and say, ‘Sign me up! I'm in.’” He recalled his disappointment when, time and time again, that simply didn't happen, and he found himself, as he continued his work over the subsequent years, regularly wondering if anyone was listening at all.Returning to Mexico this year, almost exactly 10 years later, he had his answer: a thriving culture of OA has emerged, with academic and research institutions supporting the creation and publication of several thousand OA journals via platforms like SCIELO and Redalyc, and a thriving network of open digital repositories.As I listened to him speak, it occurred to me that his experience mirrored not only my own but also those of countless others during the last decade. Whether on a campus or in a research lab, in the office of a co-author or a faculty advisor, in a conversation with a policy maker or a research funder, or even just in our own organization with our own colleagues, this simple process of making the case for OA, of planting the seed through education and advocacy, has played out again and again, thousands of times around the world. For me, the story of the last 10 years has truly been the story of these myriad individual actions building one upon another, resulting in a full-fledged global movement making OA the norm in how we share research and scholarship.Over the past decade, the OA movement has both expanded and matured. Although there's certainly no official “Open Access advocate's checklist” that we've been working from to help us measure and mark our progress, a few areas stand out as places where can we truly measure how far we've progressed.

AB  - While the open-access (OA) movement purports to be about making scholarly content open-access, its true motives are much different. The OA movement is an anti-corporatist movement that wants to deny the freedom of the press to companies it disagrees with. The movement is also actively imposing onerous mandates on researchers, mandates that restrict individual freedom. To boost the open-access movement, its leaders sacrifice the academic futures of young scholars and those from developing countries, pressuring them to publish in lower-quality open-access journals. The open-access movement has fostered the creation of numerous predatory publishers and standalone journals, increasing the amount of research misconduct in scholarly publications and the amount of pseudo-science that is published as if it were authentic science.

AU  - Østreng, Dorte
AB  - Cappelen Damm Akademisk has established an editorial division for Open Access scholarly publishing of journals and books under the name: Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing (NOASP). In cooperation with Co-Action Publishing, a pioneer in the field of Open Access publishing, NOASP has established a user-friendly platform that provides suitable presentation, legibility, straightforward navigation, optimal search-functionality and ideal distribution for scholarly journals.NOASP offers editorial support from a team of experienced editors who will steer manuscripts through the various phases of the publication process. The platform is easy to use, for editors, authors and peer-reviewers alike. It has been developed with good workflow, simple logistics and a clear system for handling multiple versions of an article in mind.NOASP was established roughly one year ago. We now have six Open Access journals, three of which are entirely new. We were also the first Norwegian publisher to release an Open Access book, and several more peer-reviewed monographs and anthologies are in the pipeline. NOASP is a member of the Open Access Scholarly Association (OASPA), the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB).The OA landscape is constantly evolving, and as an Open Access publisher, we seek out knowledge and information from experts in the field and connect with important OA-actors internationally, as well as gaining expertise in the Norwegian and Nordic context. We also support and help our journals in the accreditation process and in obtaining governmental financial support. We believe that an important role in being early movers on the OA front in Norway is to be an active part of the evolving process.NOASP provides Open Access publishing on the principle that making research accessible supports a greater exchange of knowledge. As an academic publisher, we believe Open Access publishing is an important supplement to our publication portfolio, and we are dedicated to promoting OA publishing as an essential service to the academic community in the Nordic countries.

AB  - SummaryThe Open Archives Initiative (OAI) is dedicated to solving problems of digital library interoperability. Its focus has been on defining simple protocols, most recently for the exchange of metadata from archives. The OAI evolved out of a need to increase access to scholarly publications by supporting the creation of interoperable digital libraries.As a first step towards such interoperability, a metadata harvesting protocol was developed to support the streaming of metadata from one repository to another, ultimately to a provider of user services such as browsing, searching, or annotation. This article provides an overview of the mission, philosophy, and technical framework of the OAI.

AB  - Abstract Author self-archiving systems, emerging from successful experiments with preprint servers, have emerged in a variety of fields. The Open Archives initiative was organized to create a forum to solve interoperability issues between author self-archiving solutions, as a way to promote their global acceptance. The initiative seeks to develop a framework for a “universal e-print archive” that establishes interoperability standards supporting the search and retrieval of e-print papers from all disciplines. The Santa Fe conventions were developed to ensure these archives work together so that any paper in any of these archives can be found from anyone's desktop worldwide, as if it were all in one virtual public library.

AB  - Building on the 2019 ACRL/SPARC Forum on Collective Reinvestment in Open Infrastructure, this program will explore how libraries can make different commitments to fund content created by open infrastructures. Library collections increasingly promote and reflect such open content and many have chosen to contribute to funding those products. There is not one formula or roadmap to underwrite the publishing and distribution costs of these open resources. There are many variables and considerations as some open content corresponds to serials and others are books or monographs. Open access content is increasingly found in nearly all subject areas, as scholarly publishing models have evolved. Open access does not come without a price to create, maintain and preserve the outputs. Libraries are reconsidering whether they want to commit so much to purchase materials or subscription-based products, when it is unclear what the anticipated use of any materials will be over time. Planning and opportunities for new and more flexible decisions concerning adjustments to and expenditures of the materials budget are under exploration by libraries. There are many options to invest in creating more content to be released as open access. Such options include contributing financially from the Library collections or materials budget to subsidizing or covering APCs, engaging in a more “library as publisher” model hosting journals, publishing books, creating OERs, and offsetting other expenses that ultimately drive a more intensive open infrastructure. Library leaders and partners will share their ideas about trying different approaches to contribute to more open publishing initiatives and explore whether efforts in deploying current book and serial costs to offset opportunities to build a wider and more open infrastructure is on the horizon. This analysis should incorporate the costs of analytical tools necessary to the use of such content in today’s research. Questions will be solicited ahead of time to reflect audience’s interest in such a rethinking of the library collections budget. Please email Julia Gelfand at with your questions.

AB  - Libraries and university presses coexist in a complex and increasingly consolidated scholarly communication ecosystem. Each brings different strengths, values, and viewpoints that can inform and enrich a joint project. In this paper we discuss potential barriers to and benefits of collaboration between academic libraries and university presses and introduce a case study of such a collaboration: the Open Textbook Toolkit. This project, funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, is currently investigating the components needed to support faculty in one discipline, psychology, who are considering adopting open educational resources. By leveraging both library and press expertise, the Toolkit represents one model for fruitful collaboration.

AB  - No faculty lines were open when I graduated with my MLS at the library where I was employed as a staff member, but I was able to take advantage of organizational restructuring to obtain a management position over interlibrary loan. My department head at the time was assigned with providing copyright assistance. I seized the opportunity to learn more while I searched for a position that required my degree. I was supported while pursuing continuing education in copyright. I was also given increasing responsibilities that I suspected were beyond my rank. My eagerness to develop a professional skill set had worked both for and against me.

AB  - ABSTRACT The recent literature about peer review of scholarly articles is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the cost of the peer‐review process. Possible impacts of electronic scholarly publishing upon peer reviewing are discussed. Opinion among academics in their roles as authors, editors and referees seems likely to insist upon preservation of a pre‐publication refereeing system in most disciplines. As the administration of any such system seems to have a cost of about $400 per published article, any scholarly publishing system will need to locate financial support to at least that extent, and a system of lump‐sum payment by the authors' funders is best placed to cover this cost while providing universal free access to scholarly material.

AB  - Lawrence Kuznar gives his defmition of what science should be: empirical, systematic, explicit, logical, theoretical, explanatory, predictive, self-critical, based on testing, and public (Kuznar 1997:22-24, emphasis added).It is under the assumption that good science is public than many readers open a scientific journal and expect that they are viewing an open-forum of scientific debate.However, much debate occurs between the time a manuscript is submitted to a journal and the time it is published through peer-review.Peerreview, broadly defmed, is the process by which prospective articles are critiqued by experts in the paper topic to ensure that only quality articles are published.Though peer-review is practiced by almost all journals that are considered scholarly, it is far from a perfect system.Critics cite the possibility of reviewer bias, competition, plagiarism, and conflict of interest as a few of the negative aspects of peer review.Others claim that the high level of importance placed on publication in academia today has led to a flood of new for-profit journals which result in the publication of mediocre articles.In light of these concerns, this paper will discuss some of the problematic issues surrounding the peer review process and look towards new approaches that may offer solutions to the problems discussed.Conducting a study of the peer review process is a challenge because journals do not generally provide information about their review policies to the general readership.This is peculiar because, if good science is explicit, it should be expected that the process by which it is judged be made explicit as well.Therefore, this paper will also investigate ways to make peerreview explicit to the public, while still maintaining the integrity of the process, in order to ensure that good science prevails in journal publication.'1'( rn'\j ,-,,11 i 2fj(!•'.'.()(JS C');,,"l'~;h: :',: ,:>00', '['OT[\[: '[h, l"\VOJ'"llTLlI of ,\nrhropol"gy

The «Concept of Implementation media education in Ukraine» have been analysed for the role and the place of media in the preschool, primary and higher education systems. We conducted a media literacy survey amond the students of «Preschool education» and «Primary education» speciality. It showed the sufficient level of students' ICT readiness, and readiness to applie media technology in the educational process, but it isn't attention to destructive impact of aggressive media environment to a child. It was suggested to integrate the educational media elements into teachers' training programs. Subject «The methodology of forming mathematical elements» shows for example using online tools (electronic resources) in the training of future teachers. We proved the necessity and relevancy role of media education technologies in future preschool and primary school teachers' training.

TI  - The Plan S Rights Retention Strategy is an administrative and legal burden, not a sustainable open access solution
VL  - 34
AU  - Khoo, Shaun
C1  - Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal
AB  - The Plan S Rights Retention Strategy (RRS) requires authors who are submitting to subscription journals to inform publishers that the author accepted manuscript (AAM) will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. The laudable stated aim of the RRS is to achieve immediate open access to research outputs, while preserving journal choice for authors. However, proponents of the RRS overlook the significant administrative and legal burdens that the RRS places on authors and readers. Even though compliance with existing green open access (self-archiving) policies is poor at best, the RRS is likely to rely on authors to successfully execute the CC licensing of their work in the face of publisher resistance. The complexity of copyright law and CC licensing gives many reasons to doubt the legal validity of an RRS licence grant, which creates legal risk for authors and their institutions. The complexity of RRS CC BY licensing also creates legal risk for readers, who may not be able to fully rely on the reuse rights of a CC BY licence on the AAM. However, cOAlition S has released no legal advice that explains why the RRS is valid and legally binding. Publishers of legacy subscription journals have already begun implementing strategies that ensure they can protect their revenue streams. These actions may leave authors having to choose between paying publication fees and complying with their funding agreements. The result is that the RRS increases the complexity of the copyright and licensing landscape in academic publishing, creates legal risk and may not avoid author fees. Unless increased complexity and conflict between authors and publishers drives open access, the RRS is not fit for its stated purpose as an open access strategy.

IS  - 3
VL  - 44
AU  - Jandrić, Petar
AU  - Hayes, Sarah
C1  - Zagreb University of Applied Sciences, Zagreb, Croatia
AB  - This paper explores relationships between knowledge production and academic publication and shows that the current political economy of mainstream academic publishing has resulted from a complex interplay between large academic publishers, academics, and hacker-activists. The process of publishing is a form of 'social production' that takes place across the economy, politics and culture, all of which are in turn accommodating both old and new technology in our postdigital age. Technologies such as software cannot be separated from human labour, academic centres cannot be looked at in isolation from their margins, and the necessity of transdisciplinary approaches does not imply the disappearance of traditional disciplines. In the postdigital age, the concept of the margins has not disappeared, but it has become somewhat marginal in its own right. We need to develop a new language of describing what we mean by 'marginal voices' in the social relations between knowledge production and academic publication. Universities require new strategies for cohabitation of, and collaboration between, various socio-technological actors, and new postdigital politics and practice of knowledge production and academic publishing.

TI  - The Potential of Library Publishing Services to Transform Scholarly Communication in Ireland
IS  - 4
VL  - 8
AU  - Duffy, Johannah
C1  - TUS Midlands
AB  - Libraries need to move beyond traditional roles of purchasing and distributing scholarly literature, librarians need to strategically position themselves and take ownership of improving access. As a direct result of Covid-19, there is a new level of urgency to transform the scholarly communication process and there are enormous opportunities for an expanded and inclusive library publishing service which addresses access to knowledge and literature. This rich discussion will stimulate the drive to make library publishing a mainstream service within Irish libraries. The purpose of this study is to provide a vision for how academic libraries can assume a more central role in a future where open access (OA) publishing has become the predominant model for disseminating scholarly research. This work will analyse existing trends related to Open Access policies and publishing with an emphasis on the development of repositories managed by libraries to publish and disseminate articles. These trends, coupled with emerging economic realities, will create an environment where libraries’ will assume a major role in the Open Access publishing environment. This paper will provide an insight for academic libraries and their institutions to consider a dramatic shift in the deployment of subscription financial resources from a largely closed scholarly communication system to one that provides open, unrestricted access to research. Given the importance of scholarly publishing, a number of Irish Third level libraries have launched library publishing services including the establishment and management of high quality library published peer-reviewed open access journals and Open Educational Resources to support formal and informal scholarly communication. Librarians are also upskilling in the area of library publishing. A number of Irish Librarians have completed the Library Publishing Coalition's Library Publishing Curriculum. There is also the Library Publishing Group as part of the Library Association of Ireland. This work aims to identify and examine the factors of library publishing services that facilitate scholarly communication. The clear message from this discussion is that libraries need to include publishing in their services, advocate for open access and serve their communities and societies.

TI  - The Predatory Journal: Victimizer or Victim?
AU  - Gill, Grandon
C1  - University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA
AB  - Aim/Purpose: Labeling a journal as “predatory” can do great damage to the journal and the individuals that have contributed to it. This paper considers whether the predatory classification has outlived its usefulness and what might replace it. Background: With the advent of open access publishing, the term “predatory” has increasingly been used to identify academic journals, conferences, and publishers whose practices are driven by profit or self-interest rather than the advancement of science. Absent clear standards for determining what is predatory and what is not, concerns have been raised about the misuse of the label. Methodology: Mixed methods: A brief review of the literature, some illustrative case studies, and conceptual analysis. Contribution: The paper provides recommendations for reducing the impact of illegitimate journals. Findings: Current predatory classifications are being assigned with little or no systematic research and virtually no accountability. The predatory/not predatory distinction does not accommodate alternative journal missions. Recommendations for Researchers: The distinction between legitimate and illegitimate journals requires consideration of each journal’s mission. To serve as a useful guide, a process akin to that used for accrediting institutions needs to be put in place. Impact on Society: Avoiding unnecessary damage to the careers of researchers starting out. Future Research: Refining the initial classification scheme proposed in the paper.

AB  - This article provides a detailed analysis of the current state, needs, and desires of members of the TEI community working with manuscript material, based on the results of a survey carried out by the authors. An analysis of the survey results provides insights into the practices, problems, and limitations of the community utilizing the TEI for manuscript encoding. The results demonstrate the existence of a steep learning curve for the TEI, where many practitioners are self-taught and where learning-by-doing dominates; there exists a long gap between the first encounter with the TEI and its actual use in projects. Survey results highlight the need for user-friendly, bespoke tools facilitating the processing, analysis, and publishing of TEI-encoded texts. Feedback on the Guidelines themselves reveals aspects that do not fully meet the needs of those encoding manuscript material. To better address these needs, a strengthening of the Special Interest Groups is proposed.

IS  - 1

AU  - Purnell, Philip
C1  - Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands
AB  - Research managers benchmarking universities against international peers face the problem of affiliation disambiguation. Different databases have taken separate approaches to this problem and discrepancies exist between them. Bibliometric data sources typically conduct a disambiguation process that unifies variant institutional names and those of its sub-units so that researchers can then search all records from that institution using a single unified name. This study examined affiliation discrepancies between Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions, and Microsoft Academic for 18 Arab universities over a five-year period. We confirmed that digital object identifiers (DOIs) are suitable for extracting comparable scholarly material across databases and quantified the affiliation discrepancies between them. A substantial share of records assigned to the selected universities in any one database were not assigned to the same university in another. The share of discrepancy was higher in the larger databases, Dimensions and Microsoft Academic. The smaller, more selective databases, Scopus and especially Web of Science tended to agree to a greater degree with affiliations in the other databases. Manual examination of affiliation discrepancies showed they were caused by a mixture of missing affiliations, unification differences, and assignation of records to the wrong institution.

AB  - In this paper the authors analyze the decision-making process at university presses for determining suggested retail prices of books and evaluate the effects of pricing strategies on the financial vitality of the presses. The goal was to test empirically for answers to the following questions: (1) Were university press prices eroded by changes in the economy? (2) Did commercial scholarly presses charge more than university presses for comparable titles? (3) How often did university presses increase backlist prices? (4) Did the emergence of sophisticated online retailing sites create a dynamic sales environment for university press books? Answering these questions required a multifaceted research approach. The authors interviewed university press personnel, collected statistical data on twenty-six distinct book subcategories from university and commercial scholarly presses, and reviewed government data on changes in the economy.

AB  - Key points The expansion of open access entails a responsibility for supporting this public access with a guide to why, in an ‘Age of Misinformation’, research may be trustworthy. Such a guide can also provide a check on predatory journals, a fear of which may be unduly limiting researchers tapping into the expanding global scale of research activity. Journal publishing platforms offer opportunities for automating the gathering and presenting of relevant data for assessing journal adherence to scholarly standards. Industry organizations, such as ORCID, Crossref, and DOAJ, offer trust and verification networks that can be employed to further strengthen scholarly publishing integrity.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article summarizes the effects of the increasing global trend towards measuring research quality and effectiveness through, in particular, publication‐based metrics, and its effects on scholarly communication. Such metrics are increasingly influencing the behaviour patterns of administrators, publishers, librarians, and researchers. Impact and citation measures, which often rely solely on Thomson Scientific data, are examined in the context of university league tables and research assessment exercises. The need to establish alternate metrics, particularly for the social sciences and humanities, is emphasized, as is an holistic approach to scholarly communication agenda.

AB  - Open access publications may be a means of increasing availability of scholarly materials. However, there are other drivers which prompt HE institutions to spend staff time and investment on developing IRs. If the publishing arguments are put to one side, there is a separate and strong case for developing an IR which is justified by a library's functions of collecting, managing and curating materials.

AB  - Print books and ebook devices now co-exist in a reading eco-system. The ways in which readers understand and describe their experience of reading on ebook devices is shaped by long-established cultural expectations about the abstract as well as the physical affordances of the print book. Ebook devices cannot help but challenge those expectations. A review of readers' reactions to the emergence of ebook devices offers a glimpse into the complex cultural position of both the idea and the experience of reading.

AB  - This article studies publication patterns in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in Flanders and Norway using two databases that both cover all SSH peer-reviewed journal articles by university scholars for the period 2005–9. The coverage of journal articles by the Web of Science (WoS) and the proportion of articles published in English are studied in detail applying the same methodologies to both databases. The study of WoS coverage and language use is chosen because the performance-based funding systems that are in place in both countries have given different emphasis to publishing in WoS covered journals. The results show very similar, almost identical evolutions in the use of English as a publication language. The proportion of articles covered by the WoS, however, is stable for Norway but has increased rapidly for Flanders. This finding shows that the parameters used in a performance-based funding system may influence the publishing patterns of researchers.

AB  - Crossref envisions “a rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society”. This Research Nexus expands on the importance of research objects being persistently and uniquely identified. The scholarly community has an established practice of connecting things such as citations to others’ work and it is increasingly critical to identify relationships beyond citations, bringing together published work, unpublished work, institutions, individuals, and identifying the actions that they take e.g., funding, publishing, creating, modifying, citing, and sharing. The Research Nexus brings together metadata and relationships to build a joined-up picture of the scholarly ecosystem and helps everyone identify these relationships and how they change through time. This vision is possible if all parts of the scholarly ecosystem (and beyond) work together, including various scholarly infrastructure organizations.

AB  - Abstract Despite the rising interest in open access (OA) diamond journals as a scholarly journal publishing model, their sustainability remains a pressing concern. Using the Open Access Diamond Journals Study (OADJS) Dataset, we examined the characteristics and factors of OA diamond journal publishing that are associated with high sustainability. From 1335 journals, 476 journals with low sustainability and 438 journals with high sustainability were selected and compared. Our analysis revealed that factors such as the region and official language of the publishing country and the discipline, ownership, and financial status of the journal were significantly associated with sustainability. Journals owned by government or national agencies, those with financial stability, and those promoting open practices like unrestricted text and data mining are more likely to be sustainable. This study also discusses the implications of these findings for the future of scholarly publishing and the open science movement. Ultimately, we emphasize the need for national and international support to enhance the sustainability of OA diamond journals and propose that a collective approach involving policymakers, funding agencies, and journal administrators is crucial for fostering a sustainable open access ecosystem.

AB  - This is the last editorial in the series addressing evolving models of peer review. Throughout the year, we have explored different ways in which peer review manifests—in journal articles, in research data, and in professional practice. It has generated conversations about peer review and its relevance in current scholarship and practice, both positive and critical. There have been conversations and comments about the “flaws of traditional peer review.” I hope that these are opportunities for dialogue and growth within the peer review process. Some of the concerns may be around the “traditional” models possibly perceived as driven by commercial publishers and anathema to open access. Or perhaps it is the opinion that peer review perpetuates an elitist framework around “quality.” Or it may be that the process is not transparent enough and thus, provokes skepticism. Each is a valid perspective. Hopefully, though, the conversation does not stop there.

AB  - As a consequence of developments in information technology, the traditional information chain is subject to change: the separate functions in this chain become more and more integrated and the roles played by the traditional parties are most uncertain. Several new models in scholarly publishing and communication are emerging, in which the scientific community and the scientists themselves play a central role. It is more than natural for universities to support these developments in order to realise new models of scientific communication that are more in tune with the needs of the academic community than the traditional model, which has led to a serious serials crisis. An important step in this direction is that each university encourages scientists to make more use of ICT in their research publications. However, it is also necessary to give serious attention to organisational matters: in this respect every university should take responsibility for collecting, archiving and disclosing the scientific output of its own scientists. The provision of scientific information is the traditional core business of university libraries and it is a natural extension of this role for university libraries to support this development and to organise the processes needed. The paper describes the role that universities and their libraries have to play. It also gives some examples of library initiatives in this field, including an evaluation of their impact on the innovation of scientific communication.

AB  - Adopting digital materials such as eTextbooks and e-coursepacks is a potential strategy to address textbook affordability in the United States. However, university business relationships with bookstore vendors implicitly structure which instructional resources are available and in what manner. In this study, a document analysis was conducted on the bookstore contracts for the universities included in the State University System of Florida. Namely, issues of textbook affordability, digital material terminology and seller exclusivity were investigated. It was found that textbook affordability was generally conceived in terms of print rental textbooks and buyback programs, and that eTextbooks were priced higher than print textbooks (25% to 30% markup). Implications and recommendations for change are shared.DOI: 10.18870/hlrc.v5i4.284

AB  - This study examines the role of learned societies as publishers in Finland based on bibliographic information from two Finnish databases. We studied the share of learned societies' peer‐reviewed publication channels (serials with ISSNs and book publishers with distinct ISBN roots) and outputs (journal articles, conference articles, book articles, and monographs) in Finland. We also studied the share of learned societies' open access (OA) publications. In 2018, there were 402 peer‐reviewed publication channels in Finland. In 2011–2017, the number of peer‐reviewed publications from scholars working in Finnish universities and published in Finland was 17,724. Learned societies publish around 70% of these channels and publications, mostly in the fields of humanities and social sciences. Learned societies in Finland focus on journal publishing, whereas university presses and commercial publishers focus on book publishing. In 2016–2017, 38.4% of the learned societies' outputs were OA. This study concludes that Finnish learned societies play an integral part in national scholarly publishing. They play an especially important role in journal publishing, as commercial publishers produce only 2.6% of Finnish journals and book series, and only 1.4% of the journal articles from scholars working in Finnish universities.

AB  - Purpose- the purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the potential roles of librarians in institutional repositories in Kenya. Knowledge management practices and processes have roots in library practices anteceding institutional repositories. Thus, the library as an avenue for knowledge management can effectively become a physical or virtual place for open access and scholarly communication only if librarians' step outside traditional roles. Unfortunately, institutional repositories are not fully developed in some academic institutions. Unawareness of librarians of their roles, and being unskilled in implementing the institutional repository has been incriminated for this problem. Despite this, little has been explored to understand the roles of academic librarians in institutional repositories in higher learning institutions in developing countries.Design/methodology/approach- Using analytical method, this paper analyses and presented various the matical issues on Institutional Repositories in relation to the roles of librarians, while highlighting limitations and proposing solutions for its sustainability.Findings- the paper found that globally most universities have embraced IRS. However, the unawareness of librarians of their roles and low technical skills in the use of institutional repository has been incriminated for low visibility of research output notwithstanding the many research activities undertaken by universities. In fine the academic librarians have not played their roles in institutional repositories as extensive as expected.Originality/value: Despite the high uptake of IRs by higher learning's institutions, little has been documented on the role of librarians in the use of institutional repository.Implications: the review helps higher learning institutions and academic librarians to understand how academic librarians' roles have been transformed by the emergence of institutional repositories.

AB  - Objective. The study aims to analyse the experience of university libraries in different countries in working with the Open Textbook (OT) and to consider the prospects of creating a similar pilot project in Ukraine. Methods. The analysis covered the world publications (journals, books, conference proceedings, posts on social networks) in the field of Library and Information Science, devoted to the role of libraries in OT support, that have appeared since 2014. The author studied the aspects revealing that publication, namely OT, support services are areas with great potential for the future development of academic / university libraries. Results. Numerous evidence is presented that the topic of library as a publisher in OT support is most developed in the universities and colleges in economically developed countries, especially in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain. Library strategies for OT projects have been identified. The author clarified the nature of the initiatives and partnerships of libraries in supporting OT, as well as the basic services and roles of libraries in these projects. Conclusions. Today, the global practice of Scholarly Communication has enough evidence that the functions of the Library, lost in the course of evolution, as a Knowledge Publisher have returned under its “roof” and supplemented the existing function of Knowledge Managers. Digital Library Publishing (DLP) services in OT support help to change the learning environment and life of students (including persons with disabilities), pedagogical practices of teachers by means of free textbooks with an open license, as well as to receive reputation benefits for the university, improving the image of the latter. The possibility of eliminating systemic inequalities in access to academic resources increases the significance and changes the role of libraries in open education. The successes of Ukrainian librarians in supporting digital scholarly communication initiatives and the successful implementation of Open Access support projects (repositories, e-journals, e-conferences) give confidence that they can act as initiators and key partners in creating affordable textbooks.

AB  - Purpose This paper proposes explaining institutional repositories (IRs) and open access, discussing the relationship of open access to IRs, and examining the possible roles of reference librarians in IRs. Design/methodology/approach Key IR and open access concepts are clarified and critiqued. New organizational roles for reference libraries are suggested that build on their current functions. Findings The IR concept is defined, and IRs are shown to be different from scholars' personal web sites, academic department/unit archives, institutional e‐print archives, and disciplinary archives. Open access is defined and examined. While the vision of open access is clear, the implementation of the vision is less pure. Open access and IRs are not synonyms: IRs are best seen as an enabling technology for open access. Reference librarians must play a key role in IRs, and ten potential IR support activities for them are identified. Originality/value This paper orients reference librarians, library administrators, and others to IRs and open access, providing a context for understanding how reference librarians' jobs may be transformed by the emergence of IRs.

AB  - Purpose – This purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the document delivery service according to user perception, and a usage analysis was done to inform collection building and refining. This is especially important in a high-calibre research community, where the usage, interests and research groups and disciplines are still evolving. Design/methodology/approach – To collect the responses of document delivery service users, an online questionnaire was used with 12 multiple-choice questions and two open-ended questions. The questionnaires were sent only to the users of this service, and the responses were collected anonymously. Two surveys were conducted, in 2010 and 2013, with the same questions. The responses are displayed graphically prepared to compare the results. There were 71 responses in 2010 and 95 in 2013. Findings – In both surveys, the majority of users rated the service, staff behaviour, speed, quality, etc. with a high satisfaction level. Document delivery order statistics are a major decision-making tool, in addition to usage analysis, for developing a better, economical and highly utilized collection in brand new libraries. Originality/value – This is the first published study of user perception of document delivery in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - See video of the presentation.Institutions of higher education are in a double bind with respect to scholarly communication: On the one hand, they need to support the research needs of their students and researchers by providing access to the journals that comprise the archival record of scholarship. Doing so requires payment of substantial subscription fees. On the other hand, they need to provide the widest possible dissemination of works by those same researchers -- the fruits of that very research -- which itself incurs costs. I address how these two goals, each of which demands outlays of substantial funds, can best be honored. In the course of the discussion, I provide a first look at some new results on predicting journal usage, which allows for optimizing subscriptions.

AB  - In providing a supportive and sustainable research environment, the institution has a key role to play in scholarly publishing. Whether that be as a guide, assisting researchers through the maze of publishing options and access to specialist audiences, or as an auditor for funders, or as a financer, agreeing article processing charges and subsidising website maintenance. Equally, the institution is the specialist systems developer and protector of the ‘unpublished’ research. This ensures repositories meet the needs of their researchers. In a wider context, the institution is the rewarder of scholarly publishing though promotions and the horizon scanner, preparing researchers for what is coming next. This piece looks at how the multiple roles of the institution in scholarly publishing impact researchers.

AB  - The emergence of networked digital methods of scholarly dissemination has transformed the role of the academic library in the context of the research life cycle. It now plays an important role in the dissemination of research outputs (e.g. through repository management and gold open access publication processing) as well as more traditional acquisition and collection management. The University of Manchester Library and Manchester University Press have developed a strategic relationship to consider how they can work in partnership to support new approaches to scholarly publishing. They have delivered two projects to understand researcher and student needs and to develop tools and services to meet these needs. This work has found that the creation of new journal titles is costly and provides significant resourcing challenges and that support for student journals in particular is mixed amongst senior academic administrators. Research has suggested that there is more value to the University in the provision of training in scholarly publishing than in the creation of new in-house journal titles. Where such titles are created, careful consideration of sustainable business models is vital.

This case study looks at the current and possible uses of these tools by Michigan's three largest universities: Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. The authors explore their usefulness in fostering collaboration within the University Research Corridor (URC), an alliance of the three universities, as a specific example of scholarly research collaborations. The study also examines whether any shared use of these tools would further the related missions of the URC as well as their member universities and libraries toward the ultimate goal of helping the Michigan economy.

AB  - Beall’s list heavily used as a base for selection of predatory journals by large no. of research studies was ceased from internet in 2017. Thus, status of journal declared as predatory in list is debatable. To verify quality of journals in terms of accuracy and standard of peer review, a sample of Medical Science journals from Beall list and indexed in reputed indexing/abstracting databases was taken. sample of journals was put to quality and credibility check by submitting a deliberately flawed research article. deliberate errors exceed an acceptable norm in submitted research paper. It is astonishing to see that majority of journals (61.96%) accept flawed article on such a sensitive issue, i.e., COVID-19 without peer review and desired revisions. Instant mails reporting paper's acceptance, preceded by multiple emails requesting for submission for Article processing fee, were received frequently. It is found that such publishing ventures are a scare story that only wants to generate as much revenue as possible.

AB  - Mergers and acquisitions, for example the merger of Macmillan Science and Education with Springer Science+Business Media, might suggest that large is the future for academic publishing. It might seem that giant players will dominate the future of scholarly publishing, but, at the same time, this year has seen the launch of UCL Press, the University’s in-house publishing arm. Goldsmiths, University of London, has also announced it is preparing to launch Goldsmiths Press, a new university press built on digital-first publishing, especially around unconventional projects traditionally excluded by publishers. Some of the more established university presses also seem to be increasing their scope. For example, Stanford University Press launched a new trade imprint and Manchester University Press has announced it has acquired forward titles from Bloomsbury Publishing. Insights asked two experts if there really is scope for the small academic press in the modern scholarly publishing environment. Frances Pinter has provided the perspective of the small university press. She is realistic about the challenges small academic publishers face, but concludes that there is space and opportunity for them to coexist with the giants. Michael Magoulias is equally realistic about the challenges of small, but sees the university press as a necessary, not to say, vital, alternative to commercial publishing.

AB  - This study investigates the use of institutional repositories for self-archiving peer-reviewed work in the U15 (an association of fifteen Canadian research-intensive universities). It relates usage with university open access (OA) policy types and publisher policy embargoes. We show that of all articles found in OpenAlex attributed to U15 researchers, 45.1 to 56.6% are available as Gold or Green OA, yet only 0.5 to 10.7% (mean 4.2%) of these can be found on their respective U15 IRs. Our investigation shows a lack of OA policies from most institutions, journal policies with embargoes exceeding 12 months, and incomplete policy information.

AB  - Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.

AB  - On page 24 you'll find David Kramer's in-depth report on the current state of open-access publishing. Open access and its place in the landscape of academic journals have changed since November 2012, when Physics Today last covered the topic. Besides authors, publishers, and policy makers, other actors are now on the open-access stage, among them charitable foundations, scholarly collaboration networks, and, yes, pirates who post unauthorized copies of papers on Russian servers.CYNTHIA CUMMINGSPPT|High resolutionMy attitude toward open access is conflicted. On the one hand, I agree that the fruits of publicly funded research should be freely available, especially to scientists in poor countries and to scientists employed by companies and colleges that can't afford journal subscriptions. On the other hand, I'm well aware that Physics Today is funded in part by the profits that AIP's publishing subsidiary makes from selling subscriptions to its 19 journals. If Physics Today had to rely solely on advertising and subscription revenue, it would have to shrink and change format.Regardless of where you, I, or anyone else stands on open access, there are forces in play that are hard for publishers to resist. One of those forces arises from the nature of the principal end product of scholarly research, a paper that's usually in the form of a PDF. The P in PDF stands for portable, which is what PDFs all too easily are. For Physics Today's August 2009 issue, I wrote a feature article about iron-based superconductors, which had been discovered just two years earlier. Google Scholar lists 16 unauthorized PDFs of the article, 13 of which are on Chinese websites. (I couldn't find the article on Sci-Hub, the pirate website founded by a Kazakhstani grad student.)Portability isn't the only disrupting force at play. University library budgets have not kept up with inflation or with the growth in the number of the world's scientists and their output. The cash crunch is forcing librarians to scrutinize journals based on price and usage. Subscriptions to those that don't meet increasingly stringent criteria are not renewed.Despite those trends, some aspects of scholarly publishing remain the same. It's just as hard now as it was in the 19th century to conceive of an experiment or theory that is both original and significant enough to be worth publishing in a scientific journal. Reviewing your peers' papers before publication continues to be an unpaid yet valuable duty. And a paper's final version of record still needs to be archived, online if not in bound volumes on library shelves.When I ask physicists and other scientists how they choose where to publish their work, I tend to get the same answers. Scientists want their papers to be read, so they publish in journals that their peers read. A physicist told me once that he regretted publishing in the prestigious Proceedings of the Royal Society because his fellow fluid dynamicists didn't read that journal. Physics of Fluids, he mused, would have been a better choice.Some physicists tell me that if they have a hot result, they'll go for a journal with a high impact factor, such as Physical Review Letters, Nature, or Science. But in the digital age, as George Lozano, Vincent Larivière, and Yves Gingras discovered in an extensive bibliometric study, the correlation between a journal's impact factor and a paper's citations is weakening.11. G. A. Lozano, V. Larivière, Y. Gingras, J. Am. Soc. Inf. Sci. Tec. 63, 2140 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22731One of the findings in David's report in this issue is that open-access papers in the physical sciences currently make up just 10–12% of the total. That modest proportion likely reflects the continuing appeal and reputation of traditional journals. But as any marketing guru will tell you, appeal and reputation are intangible components of a brand. The contest for the best papers in physics will likely be won by the publishers who nurture those intangibles, regardless of access model.ReferencesSection:ChooseTop of pageReferences <<CITING ARTICLES1.

AB  - ABSTRACT Scholarly Communications is in a state of unprecedented change, with publishers, scholarly societies, scientists and other scholars, librarians and legislators engaged in strategies of various kinds to push change in directions that favor their individual goals. The strategies fall into broad categories: changing the publishing market, changing the academy and changing public policy. Each set of strategies is examined in terms of desired changes and opposing forces. Trends that will likely impact the scholarly publications market are identified, as are threats.

AB  - Scholarly communication is in a perpetual state of disruption. Within this, peer review of research articles remains an essential part of the formal publication process, distinguishing it from virtually all other modes of communication. In the last several years, there has been an explosive wave of innovation in peer review research, platforms, discussions, tools and services. This is largely coupled with the ongoing and parallel evolution of scholarly communication as it adapts to rapidly changing environments, within what is widely considered as the ‘open research’ or ‘open science’ movement. Here, we summarise the current ebb and flow around changes to peer review and consider its role in a modern digital research and communications infrastructure and suggest why uptake of new models of peer review appears to have been so low compared to what is often viewed as the ‘traditional’ method of peer review. Finally, we offer some insight into the potential futures of scholarly peer review and consider what impacts this might have on the broader scholarly research ecosystem. In particular, we focus on the key traits of certification and reputation, moderation and quality control and engagement incentives, and discuss how these interact with socio-technical aspects of peer review and academic culture.

AB  - In this paper we argue that the framing of open access through language adopted by a variety of stakeholders serves to inhibit the uptake of open access publishing through the mechanisms of complexity and cognitive load. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, we analyze both the language and tiers of decisions that confront authors seeking information online about open access. We conclude that this information is for the most part prohibitively complex and introduces contradictory interpretations and executions of open access that act to motivate a phenomenon known as the status quo bias. The only reliable method of counteracting this status quo bias in order to bolster the uptake of open access is to re-frame the language that is commonly employed in association with open access and to minimize the tiers of decisions expected of authors, which create a barrier rather than a gateway to open access engagement.

AB  - Those involved in scholarly publishing are coming to recognize how open access to this body of work can increase its value and reach. Yet no one economic model of open access prevails. Rather, open access is being achieved through a variety of forms that include author self-archiving, immediate (sponsored) open access, delayed open access, and article-processing-fee open access.&nbsp; These open access models are each the result of a stratified scholarly publishing market that can be roughly grouped among independent journals, scholarly society publishers, and commercial publishers. Each of these three market segments is experimenting with forms of open access that hold promise for sustaining, if not extending, the segment&rsquo;s market position. This paper reviews the economics of these open access models, while drawing attention to the consequences of this market stratification for access to knowledge and the sustainability of scholarly publishing as a whole.Artiklen 'The Stratified Economics of Open Access' er skrevet af den drivende kraft bag OJS og hele Public Knowledge Project, John Willinsky.L&aelig;s mere om John Willinsky p&aring; Wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Willinsky&nbsp;&nbsp

AB  - Key points The supply chain for monographs and related types of books is much more complex than that for journals. Sales per title are falling, while the efforts devoted to marketing individual titles have diminished too. Readers have a strong preference for physical print rather than e‐books, while libraries’ preference in purchasing is the other way round. Publishers, intermediaries, and libraries all face additional costs and complexity because they must continue to deal with both print and e‐books. Current inefficiencies in the supply chain act as a restraint on discoverability, demand, and access to academic books.

AB  - Libraries, consortia, and publishers are exploring new models to support Open Access (OA) content. Native OA journal publishers are facing a different set of challenges as there is no existing library subscription base to transform into support for OA. Author-pays OA models are challenging to the ecosystem for a variety of reasons. Large institutions with heavy scholarly output may pay more, small institutions that use the content but publish less are wondering what role they will play, and authors from the global south may not have funding to pay Article Processing Charges (APCs). What new models are under exploration to address the complexity of funder mandates, reduce administrative burden of complex APC models, and the need to be more inclusive of a diverse community?

AB  - As open‐access ( OA ) publishing funded by article‐processing charges ( APCs ) becomes more widely accepted, academic institutions need to be aware of the “total cost of publication” (TCP), comprising subscription costs plus APCs and additional administration costs. This study analyzes data from 23 UK institutions covering the period 2007–2014 modeling the TCP . It shows a clear rise in centrally managed APC payments from 2012 onward, with payments projected to increase further. As well as evidencing the growing availability and acceptance of OA publishing, these trends reflect particular UK policy developments and funding arrangements intended to accelerate the move toward OA publishing (“ G old” OA ). Although the mean value of APCs has been relatively stable, there was considerable variation in APC prices paid by institutions since 2007. In particular, “hybrid” subscription/ OA journals were consistently more expensive than fully OA journals. Most APCs were paid to large “traditional” commercial publishers who also received considerable subscription income. New administrative costs reported by institutions varied considerably. The total cost of publication modeling shows that APCs are now a significant part of the TCP for academic institutions, in 2013 already constituting an average of 10% of the TCP (excluding administrative costs).

AB  - As Open access (OA) is often perceived as the end goal of scholarly publishing, much research has focused on flipping subscription journals to an OA model. Focusing on what can happen after the presumed finish line, this study identifies journals that have converted from OA to a subscription model, and places these “reverse flips” within the greater context of scholarly publishing. In particular, we examine specific journal descriptors, such as access mode, publisher, subject area, society affiliation, article volume, and citation metrics, to deepen our understanding of reverse flips. Our results show that at least 152 actively publishing journals have reverse-flipped since 2005, suggesting that this phenomenon does not constitute merely a few marginal outliers, but instead a common pattern within scholarly publishing. Notably, we found that 62% of reverse flips (N = 95) had not been born-OA journals, but had been founded as subscription journals, and hence have experienced a three-stage transformation from closed to open to closed. We argue that reverse flips present a unique perspective on OA, and that further research would greatly benefit from enhanced data and tools for identifying such cases.

AB  - Whilst take-up of open access (OA) in the UK is growing rapidly due partly to a number of funder mandates, managing the complexities of balancing compliance with these mandates against restrictive publisher policies and ingrained academic priorities, has resulted in UK higher education institutions (HEIs) often struggling with confused researchers, complex workflows, and rising costs. In order to try to address this situation, the UK Scholarly Communication Licence (UK-SCL) was formulated to bypass the root causes of many of these challenges by implementing a licensing mechanism for multiple-mandate compliance in one single policy. This is the first empirical study to focus on the genesis of the UK-SCL and how its implementation has been conceived thus far. A qualitative research method was used, taking the form of 14 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from the initiative across the UK. The results indicate that those working within UK HEIs are concerned with the complexity of the current OA policy landscape and are frustrated with the inertia within the current system, which has resulted in higher costs, further publisher restrictions, and has not addressed the underlying tensions in academic culture. The UK-SCL is seen by its initiators as a way to achieve further transition towards OA and take back some element of control of the content produced at their institutions. The study concludes by modelling the ways in which the UK-SCL is intended to impact relationships between key stakeholders, and discussing possible implementation futures.

AB  - This paper advances the debate on scholarly publishing and the role of bibliometric indices in evaluating authors and their research, through a theoretical discussion and an empirical case study focused on economics and the impact factor. The rationale of the current bibliometric system is that reputation, assessed by citation figures, can be converted into an objective measure. We instead argue that it provides questionable results, because it fails to properly consider the meaning of indicators built for different purposes, as well as the psychological bias generated by the wrong interpretation of those indicators. However, the potential for abating these distortions exists.

AB  - In 2014, University of California, Davis University Library and the California Digital Library collaborated on an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant-funded project to explore costs associated with moving scholarly journal subscriptions in the U.S. market entirely to an Article Processing Charge business model, known also as "Gold Open Access." We contacted MacKenzie Smith, one of the principal investigators, in order to get her reflections on the process of gathering the data, and to discuss some implications of the findings. The interview suggests that the "Pay It Forward" model could be successful over time, following a necessarily complex transition period.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine recent trends that have affected university presses (UPs). The increased reliance on digital resources and fiscal constraints within higher education has forced UPs to re-evaluate their position with the scholarly communication system. Responses include an increased focus on partnerships, new forms of publication, changing business models and better meeting customers’ needs. Design/methodology/approach – The authors have reviewed publications on UPs from the past five years and added their viewpoints on current and future trends. Findings – UPs must adapt to resource scarcity and current trends in scholarly communication to remain viable. Practical implications – Both UPs and academic libraries may gain insights on how to meet the needs of researchers and scholars within a changing environment. Originality/value – This paper summarizes and evaluates a broad spectrum of research on UPs.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the uptake of the GPRC label (Guaranteed Peer Reviewed Content label) since its introduction in 2010 until 2019. GPRC is a label for books that have been peer reviewed introduced by the Flemish publishers association. The GPRC label allows locally published scholarly books to be included in the regional database for the Social Sciences and Humanities which is used in the Flemish performance-based research funding system. Ten years after the start of the GPRC label, this is the first systematic analysis of the uptake of the label. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our two main data sources are the Flemish regional database for the Social Sciences and Humanities, which currently includes 2,580 GPRC-labeled publications, and three interviews with experts on the GPRC label. Firstly, we study the importance of the label in the Flemish performance-based research funding system. Secondly, we analyse the label in terms of its possible effect on multilingualism and the local or international orientation of publications. Thirdly, we analyse to what extent the label has been used by the different disciplines. Lastly, we discuss the potential implications of the label for the peer review process among book publishers. We find that the GPRC label is of limited importance to the Flemish performance-based research funding system. However, we also conclude that the label has a specific use for locally oriented book publications and in particular for the discipline Law. Furthermore, by requiring publishers to adhere to a formalized peer review procedure, the label affects the peer review practices of local publishers because not all book publishers were using a formal system of peer review before the introduction of the label and even at those publishers who already practiced peer review, the label may have required the publishers to make these procedures more uniform.

AB  - Shadow libraries (SLs), such as Sci-Hub, Z-Library, and Library Genesis (LibGen), are online databases that provide content that is otherwise difficult to access (due to paywalls or other copyright controls) using unofficial methods of questionable legality. Interest in the SL phenomenon has focused on copyright infringement that occurs when a database provides library materials, for which access rights need to be purchased, without the knowledge of a given copyright owner. This study analyzes the use of SLs at the Universitas Indonesia (UI). The research uses a quantitative approach, with a survey distributed to 262 undergraduate students at UI. The frequency of SL use in academic activities of UI students is compared with the use of the UI Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC UI). The results show that most UI students have not used SLs. However, those who have used SLs report more positive impressions and higher levels of satisfaction compared with OPAC UI.

AB  - Open access is one of the prime motivators in the transformation of scholarly communication in the twenty-first century academy. While most of the attention of the movement has been focused on the work of faculty and graduate students, undergraduate researchers also offer great potential to be catalysts for change. The UNT Libraries have taken on an active role in encouraging and educating the UNT community on Open Access issues, including implementation of their Open Access Policy, providing repository services that support Open Access, participation in International Open Access Week, and year-round seminars on the importance of Open Access initiatives. This paper describes the importance of Open Access, its impact on the academic community and scholars, and initiatives of the UNT Libraries and Honors College for Open Access outreach.

AB  - ABSTRACT Two-sided markets are a relatively new economic concept that has relevance for scholarly communications. Scholarly journals, as well as bundles of scholarly journals, can best be understood as examples of two-sided markets, and journal-pricing issues can best be examined using this concept. Serials librarians, electronic resources librarians, and scholarly communications specialists should incorporate two-sided markets into their understanding of the shifting journals environment.

AB  - The “version of record” is an organizing concept in scholarly publishing. It is by reference to that version that others are understood and it is the object of financial models, policies, and recognition and reward systems. At the same time, many of the core functions of academic publishing – in particular, registration and dissemination – are decoupling from the version of record. Scholarly publishers are also expanding their remit to encompass other article versions, as well as other research outputs, and efforts to systematically link together and track these into a “record of versions” are growing.

AB  - This article considers the case study of university libraries in the United Kingdom, and their exposure to the effects of the worldwide recession. Exchange rate changes have been a noteworthy aspect of the U.K. situation, with the pound sterling deteriorating markedly against both the Euro and the U.S. Dollar. Examples of the impact of these changes are outlined. The implications of government spending plans over the next few years are also examined. Some possible ways of coping with these changes are explored, including the expansion of shared services, a reduction in the prevalence of publisher bundle subscriptions, and an increase in the impact of open access activity.

AB  - Abstract Economic forces have created the need for librarians to explore new methods of delivering information. Technological developments have created the means for librarians themselves to move into electronic publishing to increase cost-efficiency. A new consor tium model is proposed in which members would both generate scholarly work and access it at a lower cost. Included are overviews of scholarly publishing, copyright issues, technological feasibility, value added features, and the effects of the proposed consortium.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Web has evolved as a hypertext environment whose value is derived from a simple ability to link resources together. The advanced linking features of some early hypertext systems might be implemented in the Web in various ways. The Semantic Web is one aspect of the continuing evolution of the Web which may be of value to the evolution of scholarly publishing and research, and may enable publishers to justify investment in the future. The key advantages are the ability to unlock value from the existing scholarly literature by enabling innovation in research tools; further encouraging the creation of a marketplace of services of value to the publishing industry; and ensuring that websites and content are well integrated into the Web as it exists now and in the future.

AB  - Pierre Mounier presents OPERAS, the European research infrastructure dedicated to open scholarly communication in the social sciences and humanities. With 10 core and a further 40+ member institutions from 16 different countries, its aim is to share knowledge between stakeholders across Europe. As a distributed infrastructure, OPERAS consists of a number of multinational Special Interest Groups that work on specific topics with the aim of developing services and conducting projects at a European level. Ranging from technical service providers and libraries through university presses and learned societies to entire research institutes and universities, OPERAS brings together a variety of stakeholders that work collectively to promote open dissemination of research-based knowledge about society and culture. All interest groups are convened twice a year for an "assembly of the commons"; further coordinating and strategic tasks are taken care of by an Executive Committee and a General Assembly. All member organisations are required to work for open access. Individuals that want to contribute are encouraged to check whether there are any member institutions in their country; in case not, they can always contact one of the coordinators (Pierre Mounier or Suzanne Dumouchel) or another member of the Executive Committee directly. Recording made in conjunction with the 17th Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing. First published online: December 27, 2022.

VL  - 66

C1  - Российская государственная библиотека
AB  - Involving free online resources in the library services improves the information support for users. The terms "free resources", "open" are used for designation of free resources, which do not require financial compensation. In practice, however, Russian libraries have not yet developed a unified approach for understanding the terms "free resources", "free access", "open access". ISO 5127 and ISO 2789 International Standards recommend including in the library's collections these free Internet resources, which could be catalogued by the library in its online catalogue or some other library database. It's necessary to define the groups of networked resources which the library can include in its collections, and those resources that are of interest to users, but couldn't be included in the library stock. Organization of access to free resources shall be carried out in two ways: entering information about the resources in the library catalogue or other database and providing common search or the development of navigation tools based on the links grouped by any attribute on the library website. Processing of all kinds of free resources for users is part of the technological scheme of the network resources collection development and has various specific characteristics that affect the selection, registration, administration and management of the electronic resources.

AB  - What will emerge as the dominant design(s) of the "information package" of the future? How do we resolve major obstacles to the creation and utilization of electronic documents? What concepts, terms, and design principles need to be defined to discuss these questions meaningfully and to start answering them? What do these new concepts, terms and design principles mean in editorial and publishing practice? Drawing on the experience of developing: Living Reviews in Relativity, an innovative online journal for physics, the paper discusses these latter questions. The paper highlights some of the information needs which Living Reviews fills and explains how the principles guiding its design attempt to meet those needs. These design principles are "synergy", "adaptability", and "utilizability" of information. In addition, the paper discusses a basic assumption that, rather than having readers, Living Reviews has users for whom we are providing a research tool. Combining that perspective with the fact that we are offering (literature/research) review articles, and with the fact that we are working in an electronic environment which allows multiple forms of indexing and presentation, we have decided to treat our reference information as highly significant. The paper discusses how we treat this information as significant, and the impact we expect this treatment to have.

IS  - 4
VL  - 24
AU  - Kingsley, Danny
C1  - Centre for the Public Awareness of Science Australian National University Canberra Australia
AB  - Purpose By describing some of the often‐ignored aspects of repository advocacy, such as disciplinary differences and how these might affect the adoption of a particular institutional repository, this paper aims to offer practical guidance to repository managers and those responsible for open access and repository policy. Design/methodology/approach The argument uses examples from an empirical study of 43 in‐depth interviews of academic staff in three disciplines, Chemistry, Computer Science and Sociology, at two Australian universities. The interviewees discussed their interaction with the literature as an author, a reader and a reviewer. Findings The study finds that disciplines are markedly different from one another, in terms of their subject matter, the speed of publication, information‐seeking behaviour and social norms. These all have bearing on the likelihood a given group will adopt deposit into an institutional repository as part of their regular work practice. Practical implications It is important to decide the purpose of the institutional repository before embarking on an advocacy program. By mapping empirical findings against both diffusion of innovations theory and writings on disciplinary differences, this paper shows that repository advocacy addressing the university academic population as a single unit is unlikely to be successful. Rather, advocacy and implementation of a repository must consider the information seeking behaviour and social norms of each discipline in question. Originality/value The consideration of disciplinary differences in relation to repository advocacy has only begun to be explored in the literature.

AB  - Commercial publishing houses continue to make unbounded profits while exploiting the free labour of researchers through peer review. If publishers are to be compensated financially for the value that they add within a capitalist system, then so should all others who add value, including reviewers. I propose that peer review should be included as a professional service by research institutes in their contracts with commercial publishers. This would help to recognize the value of peer review, and begin to shape it into a functional form of quality control.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel framework for a scholarly journal – a token‐curated registry (TCR). This model originates in the field of blockchain and cryptoeconomics and is essentially a decentralized system where tokens (digital currency) are used to incentivize quality curation of information. TCR is an automated way to create lists of any kind where decisions (whether to include N or not) are made through voting that brings benefit or loss to voters. In an academic journal, TCR could act as a tool to introduce community‐driven decisions on papers to be published, thus encouraging more active participation of authors/reviewers in editorial policy and elaborating the idea of a journal as a club. TCR could also provide a novel solution to the problems of editorial bias and the lack of rewards/incentives for reviewers. In the paper, we discuss core principles of TCR, its technological and cultural foundations, and finally analyse the risks and challenges it could bring to scholarly publishing.

AB  - We examine the impact of communication technology on scholarly productivity by considering patterns of coauthored economics articles. Using articles in three major economics journals from 1970–79 and 1992–96, we find (1) sharp growth from distant coauthorships (authors not in the same metropolitan area prior to publication), as the theory predicts, and, contrary to theory, (2) lower productivity of distant than close‐coauthored works and no decline in their relative disadvantage. These findings are reconciled by noting that high technology has aspects of a consumer good. The relative productivity of solo‐authored articles has decreased, perhaps explaining the secular increase in coauthorship.

AB  - This environmental scan argues for the value in making grant proposals open access. Applying for and receiving grant funding is an important facet of research. However, accessing information on grant application, review, and award processes remains a particular challenge for early career scholars, researchers from smaller or under-resourced institutions, and traditionally marginalized scholars. While the open access movement has made research publications resulting from funded grants publicly available, grant proposals are rarely included. When proposals are shared, they are difficult to find due to variability in metadata implementation and quality. This work asks: What are central challenges in making grant proposals open access? How can increased access to grant proposals contribute to equity and transparency in funding distribution? What existing repositories contain grant materials? What standards and incentives can be established among grant-seeking and funding stakeholders to improve grant proposal accessibility? This work concludes with perspectives shared during a May 2022 advisory group meeting of stakeholders involved in the Institute of Museum and Library Services–funded project Planning for Open Grants, which focuses on potential solutions in grant seeking and funding processes for working toward an open grants standard across research communities.

AB  - ABSTRACT Academics and librarians have worked in tandem for many years to broaden access to the scholarship they create, scrutinize, collect, and consume. Recent developments have focused on campus faculty advocating for change by developing self-imposed open access policies. Such policy developments have occurred in an evolutionary process, the beginnings of which might be identified as the “serials crisis” peaking in the 1990s, followed by the focus on efforts to examine and reform broken aspects of the system of scholarly communication, and most recently the feasibility of faculty-initiated open access policies on university campuses. This article provides an analysis of one university's 10- year evolution to an open access policy focusing primarily on its advocates’ lessons learned and the library's role in order to add the perspective of a public institution's experience.

AB  - The Government of Ireland has set a target of achieving 100% open access to publicly funded scholarly publications by 2030. As a key element of achieving this objective, the PublishOA.ie project was established to evaluate the feasibility of establishing an all-island [Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland] digital publishing platform for Diamond Open Access journals and monographs designed to advance best practice and meet the needs of authors, readers, publishers, and research funding organisations in Irish scholarly publishing. It should be noted in this context that there is substantial ‘north–south’ cooperation between public bodies in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, some of whom operate on what is commonly termed an ‘all-island’ basis. The project commenced in November 2022 and will run until November 2024, with the submission of a Final Report. This article originated as an interim project report presented in September 2023 at the PubMet2023 conference in Zadar, Croatia. The project is unique in its mandate to report on the feasibility of a shared platform that will encompass scholarly publishing across the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, which are now, post-Brexit, inside and outside the European Union (EU): the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. The project is co-led by the Royal Irish Academy (RIA), Ireland’s leading body of experts in the Sciences and Humanities, and the Trinity Long Room Hub Arts &amp; Humanities Research Institute of Trinity College Dublin. There are sixteen partners and affiliates from universities and organisations from the island of Ireland. The feasibility study will be based on a review of the publishing practices in the island of Ireland, with gap analysis on standards, technology, processes, copyright practices, and funding models for Diamond OA, benchmarking against other national platforms, and specifications of the requirements, leading to the delivery of a pilot national publishing platform. A set of demonstrator journals and monographs will be published using the platform, which will be actively trialled by the partner publishers and authors. PublishOA.ie aims to deliver an evidence-based understanding of Irish scholarly publishing and of the requirements of publishers to transition in whole or in part to Diamond OA. This paper provides an interim report on progress on the project as of September 2023, ten months after its commencement.

AB  - The text that follows is a slightly revised extract from my doctoral thesis (Francke 2008) [1]. It draws on the notions of information architecture and document architecture to identify a set of concepts for analysing documents as sociotechnical artefacts. The analytical tool was developed for the purpose of analysing scholarly journals, which has tinged it to some extent, but it is likely applicable also for analysis of other document types and genres. As part of identifying concepts, I refer to several of the more established ways of conceptualising information architecture and document architecture. As such, the text may provide an introduction to these two areas, as they looked a few years ago when the thesis was prepared. The article may thus be of interest both as a first introduction to the two perspectives and from a theoretical and methodological point of view

AB  - Electronic publishing, especially publishing for the Web, is slowly becoming the main avenue for the dissemination of scholarly edited versions of primary texts. While this is a welcome development and increases access to high quality resources for casual users, it also poses new hindrances to deeper engagement with texts published in such a way. This article discusses some of the requirements for such a deeper engagement with texts, both in terms of the needed functionality, which includes commenting, annotating, translating, but also linking and enriching the texts and in terms of the needed overall architecture and the desired modes of communication between readers of such texts.

AB  - In recent years there has been growing international interest in the development of shared facilities to house legacy print collections as a means of providing cost-effective and secure storage. These ‘repositories’ have in some cases been successfully implemented on a national scale. This article traces the recent history of Australian attempts to reach a similar national solution to the space problems that afflict many of our research libraries. It argues that, although these negotiations have not been successful to date, the opportunity still exists to re-open discussion. It also makes suggestions regarding the organisational structures that are needed to bring about a successful outcome.

AB  - This paper analyzes recent literature on or using the term “open pedagogy” in order to distill a working definition. The term is currently contested, and is discarded completely by some influencers due to a lack of definition and thus usefulness as a rigorous academic term. This study analyzes how researchers currently use the term in the literature, searching for commonalities, with the goal of proposing a synthesis that encompasses the majority of the field and can provide potential common ground for further research on the subject. The result was a pool of 98 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, which were then scanned and classified to develop a taxonomy. The taxonomy was used to construct a working definition of open pedagogy as any pedagogy informed by the practitioners’ conscious identification with the open movement, open access, and open educational resources (OER). In effect, open pedagogy describes the interaction between the open movement and pedagogy, whereas open educational practices (OEP) and OER-enabled pedagogy describe the actual practices arising from that pedagogical approach.

These results and the ensuing discussion highlighted important issues associated with e-publishing formats based on the perspectives of the CJUCE readership. This paper extends that discussion to include a look at overcoming existing criticisms of the peer-review process, current changes in university library holdings, and perspectives of the contributors with respect to e-journal formats.

AB  - Research as a digital enterprise has created new, often poorly addressed challenges for the management and curation of research to ensure continuity, transparency, and accountability. There is a common misunderstanding that curation can be considered at a later point in the research cycle or delegated or that it is too burdensome or too expensive due to a lack of efficient tools. This creates a curation gap between research practice and curation needs. We argue that this gap can be narrowed if curators provide attractive support that befits research needs and if researchers consistently manage their work according to generic concepts consistently from the beginning. A rather uniquely long-term case study demonstrates how such concepts have helped to pragmatically implement a research practice intentionally using only minimalist tools for sustained, self-contained archiving since 1989. The paper sketches the concepts underlying three core research activities. (i) handling of research data, (ii) reference management as part of scholarly publishing, and (iii) advancing theories through modelling and simulation. These concepts represent a universally transferable best research practice, while technical details are obviously prone to continuous change. We hope it stimulates researchers to manage research similarly and that curators gain a better understanding of the curation challenges research practice actually faces.

AB  - Quantum key distribution – a process that encodes digital information – often utilises fibre optic technologies for commercial applications. Fibre provides the benefit of a dark channel as well as the convenience of independence of a line-of-sight connection between the sender and receiver. In order to implement quantum key distribution protocols utilising polarisation encoding, the birefringence effects of fibre must be compensated for. Birefringence is caused by manufacturing impurities in the fibre or a change in environmental conditions and results in a rotation of the state of polarisation of light as it is propagated through the fibre. With dynamic environmental conditions, the birefringence effects should be monitored with a test signal at regular time intervals so that the polarisation of each photon can be appropriately compensated to its original state. Orthogonal states are compensated simultaneously, but most protocols, such as BB84 and B92, require non-orthogonal basis sets. Instead of using a compensator for each basis, the presented scheme fixes the polarisation controller onto the plane on the Poincaré that passes through both bases, compensating both non-orthogonal bases simultaneously.

IS  - 1
VL  - 5
AU  - Eve, Martin
C1  - Birkbeck, University of London
AB  - The current generation of web annotation technologies use a set of keying techniques, often based on the Document Object Model (DOM) for representing HTML content, that link an annotation to its target content. However, when the DOM structure changes, for any reason, or browser rendering engines parse the underlying source differently, annotations can be orphaned and incorrectly re-attached. This article explores the preservation strategies that are required to ensure the longevity of scholarly annotations that use such technologies. These recommendations range from the social changes needed for the perception of annotations as first-class scholarly objects through to the technological changes and infrastructures that are needed for the preservation of such objects. It concludes with a series of recommendations for changes in practice and infrastructure that work towards the digital preservation of DOM-node-keyed scholarly web annotations.

AB  - In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have come into view as one of the most transformative developments in the technical domain, influencing diverse sectors ranging from natural language processing (NLP) to creative arts. Their rise signifies an unprecedented convergence of computational prowess, sophisticated algorithms, and expansive datasets, pushing the boundaries of what was once thought to be achievable. Such a profound impact mandates a thorough exploration of the LLMs’ evolutionary trajectory. Consequently, this article conducts a literature review of the most impactful scientific works, using the reliable Web of Science (WoS) indexing database as a data source in order to attain a thorough and quality-assured analysis. This review identifies relevant patterns, provides research insights, traces technological growth, and anticipates potential future directions. Beyond mapping the known, this study aims to highlight uncharted areas within the LLM landscape, thereby catalyzing future research endeavors. The ultimate goal is to enhance collective understanding, encourage collaboration, and guide subsequent innovations in harnessing the potential of LLMs for societal and technological advancement.

TI  - Traditional Factors of Fit, Perceived Quality, and Speed of Publication Still Outweigh Open Access in Authors’ Journal Selection Criteria
IS  - 4
VL  - 7
AU  - Dalton, Michelle
C1  - Univ. of Limerick Limerick Ireland
AB  - Objective – To determine the extent to which the open access (OA) status of a journal influences authors in their journal selection decisions and to analyze the sources of funding for the article-processing charges (APCs) applied in professional OA publishing.&#x0D; &#x0D; Design – Survey questionnaire.&#x0D; &#x0D; Setting – The international open access scholarly publishing sector.&#x0D; &#x0D; Subjects – 1,038 researchers across all academic disciplines who have recently published work in open access journals that charge APCs. &#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – Journals listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals were stratified into seven discipline clusters, and systematic random sampling was used where possible to collect a sample of up to 15 journals per cluster that levy APCs. For each individual journal, the authors of the 15 most recently published articles (working from 2010 backwards) were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire on the factors influencing their choice of journal and the source(s) used to fund processing charges. Additional background information about the authors and journals was also collected and merged with the survey responses. &#x0D; &#x0D; Main Results – The results of the survey identified the fit of the article with the journal’s subject area, the perceived quality or impact of the journal, and the speed of the peer-review and publishing process as the dominant factors in the journal selection decision of authors. All three aspects were judged as either “very important” or “important” by 80% or more of respondents – significantly higher than the corresponding figure of 60% in relation to the open access status of the journal. &#x0D; &#x0D; The analysis also indicated that two key elements appear to influence how APCs are funded: the research discipline and the country of origin of the author. The use of research grants to fund charges is more prevalent in scientific disciplines than in the humanities, whilst researchers based in lower-income countries more frequently identify APCs as a barrier than those in higher-income countries. Grants and institutional funding tend to be the primary sources of funding for journals with higher APCs, whilst personal funding is utilised more often in cases where the fee is less than $500.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion – Despite the increasing focus on the accessibility and visibility of research, academics still appear to place a greater value on ‘who’ rather than ‘how many’ readers access their research, and consequently traditional factors still persist as the main determinants in an author’s choice of journal. The future success of the APC model, compared with the traditional subscription-based or hybrid models, will ultimately depend on the ability of authors to obtain the necessary funding to pay such charges, combined with the extent to which the quality of services offered by open access publishers is perceived as being commensurate with the associated publishing fees.

AB  - Scholarly publishing is on the verge of a drastic change from print journals to electronic ones. Although this change has been predicted for a long time, trends in technology and growth in the literature are making this transition inevitable. It is likely to occur in a few years, and is likely to be sudden. This article surveys the pressures that are leading to the impending change, and makes predictions about the future of journals, publishers, and libraries. The new electronic publishing methods are likely to improve greatly scholarly communication, partially through more rapid publication, but also through wider dissemination and a variety of novel features that cannot be implemented with the present print system, such as references in a paper to later papers that cite it.

AB  - Abstract In this paper, we use computer techniques to extract the features of each convolutional layer of CNN, analyze the feature variations of different depth convolutions, and propose a new network framework to improve the head pose estimation task performance by combining the task characteristics of head pose estimation. Multi-scale feature information fusion is the basis of the proposed head pose estimation method (IRHP-Net), which consists of a feature extraction module and a multi-scale feature information fusion module. In the smart classroom learning environment, the algorithm is used to identify students’ attention areas and construct the distraction index and threshold parameters to determine the inattentive state and provide relevant teaching measures. Smart classroom teaching resulted in a 39.69% increase in students’ attention, as shown in the results. Students in the traditional teaching mode showed a 16.7% lower level of learning engagement. A 17.24% increase in academic performance was also a result of the increase in attention and learning engagement.

AB  - In 2011 the University of Wollongong Library undertook a significant review of its Resource Sharing services. This was prompted by constraints in the systems supporting this service, changes to the Library's key suppliers, Infotrieve Australia and the British Library Document Supply Service, and the need to deliver effective library services within a defined physical and budgetary environment.As a result of the review, the existing Millennium Interlibrary Loan and Ariel software hosting the service were replaced by the Relais ILL system. The most cost-effective and relevant methods for supporting the research needs of the university were achieved through subscriptions with networks characterized by strong unmediated requesting functionalities, including ArticleReach, BONUS+, and RapidILL. To expand the Library's access to international collections, a subscription to OCLC WorldCat Resource Sharing was begun.UOW Library now processes approximately 50% more requests, 76% of which are now processed to some degree without library staff mediation.

AB  - Charles W. Bailey Jr. is well known in librarian circles for his compilations and commentary on open access publishing, digital copyright, and repositories for digitized scholarship and collections, among other areas of interest. Bailey has been a frequent contributor to various library and scholarly email discussion lists with links to his digital bibliographies and brief introductions. In 2005, he founded Digital Scholarship with the purpose of publishing and distributing his work in both paper and digital formats, as well as a related blog, DigitalKoans. Perhaps his most well-known bibliography, the Scholarly Electronic Publishing Bibliography, has been updated more than seventy-five times and now appears in an annual print edition as well as the electronic format, according to the appendix “About the Author.”Transforming Scholarly Publishing Through Open Access is another in a growing list of Bailey's self-published works. The paperback edition is sold for $15.95, and it is available free in open-access digital format through www.digital-scholarship.org.Bibliographers perform a critical role by compiling and bringing order to the world of knowledge, with careful consideration for what is most important and seminal in a subject. Bailey is a master of compiling lists of articles, web pages, white papers, and books on a particular topic and distributing them to a wide audience. However, Bailey does little to help readers understand his selection criteria and his understanding of the significance of these citations. This bibliography, like the others, is extensive and well organized with topical subheadings. A preface helps readers understand what “open access” means and what models are available.The publication is divided into twelve parts. “Section 1: General Works” gives a list of publications discussing overviews, critiques, and debates, as well as economic issues. Nearly all sections also contain a list of research studies related to the section theme. Section 2 contains citations discussing copyright. Section 3 includes discussions of open access journals, including PubMed Central, Public Library of Science (PLoS), and others. Section 4 deals with electronic prints, while section 5 features disciplinary archives. Institutional repositories are the focus area of section 6, and it is the most extensive section. Section 7 includes the open archives initiative, and section 8 is titled, “Library Issues.” A list of publications addressing traditional publisher perspectives is in section 10, and section 11 lists publications discussing open access in emerging economies. Finally, section 12 is for Google Books, a subject that just became a bibliography in itself at the time of this writing.Much can be learned by reviewing the citations alone, but this can be done conveniently online without purchasing a print copy. Readers of the print version will want to locate the digital version anyway for the convenience of accessing the links to web-based articles. The publication's value would be greatly increased with annotations to selected citations and written overviews of each section. Highlighting what he considers the “most important” and discussing selection criteria would also be helpful and of interest to the reader. This bibliography is recommended for everyone interested in open access publishing.

AB  - ABSTRACT Over the last two decades, China has seen an enormous rise in the number of scientific journals, second only to the USA. However, their overall academic level has not been high as expected. In fact the frequent occurrence of ‘trash’ journals has been a very negative development. In this regard, we will define trash journals and analyze their characteristics. In addition, we explore how such journals come into existence and look at their relationship with ‘legal’ journals. The development of trash journals is directly associated with market demand and profit, and a flawed academic evaluation system. We advocate action by government departments to purge academia of trash journals and give examples of how this could be done.

AB  - Research productivity and visibility are becoming increasingly important in the individual researcher’s pursuit to build his or her research reputation, be promoted to the next academic rank within an institution and gain national and international recognition among peers. This paper analyses the research trends and patterns of the academic staff of the College of Health Sciences (CHS) at Moi University in Kenya between 2002 and 2014 to gauge their research productivity and visibility. The names of the academic staff of the CHS who were in employment at the end of 2012 were listed and subjected to a visibility search on the Publish or Perish software that uses Google Scholar as its data source. The findings on output reveal the following: the trend of publication has shown an upward growth since 2007 and is projected to continue to grow as it approaches linearity, until 2025; the School of Medicine was the most prolific and visible; approximately one third of the publications in the CHS originated in the departments of epidemiology and medicine; full professors’ performance exceeded that of the other ranks; researchers at the CHS rely heavily on a locally-published journal (East African Medical Journal) to publish their research; slightly over two thirds of the publications were singly authored; international collaborations were prominently visible; and most medical and health research conducted at the CHS focused on western Kenya, where Moi University is located. For higher productivity and wider visibility of CHS research, the researchers recommend additional funding; publication of the research through a variety of avenues, including open access journals, and the dissemination of the publications through social media platforms; and strengthening of the international collaboration networks, among others. For purposes of further research, the authors propose a study that will investigate the medical and health research visibility and impact across several institutions in Kenya.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper presents summary results from an analysis of the institutional subscription prices for journals in biomedical and social sciences, for a selection of 11 publishers. Overall price, price per page, and price per point of impact factor have been examined for the period 2000–2006. Considerable variation was found between publishers both in their overall levels of price and in the rates of increase observed over the period. There is some evidence that not‐for‐profit publishers may, on average, offer better value for money in terms of price per page and price per point of impact factor, but this is far from conclusive.

AB  - The shift towards the use of electronic media in scholarly communication appears to be an inescapable imperative.However, these shifts are uneven, both with respect to field and with respect to the form of communication.Different scientific fields have developed and use distinctly different communicative forums, both in the paper and electronic arenas, and these forums play different communicative roles within the field.One common claim is that we are in the early stages of an electronic revolution, that it is only a matter of time before other fields catch up with the early adopters, and that all fields converge on a stable set of electronic forums.A social shaping of technology (SST) perspective helps us to identify important social forces -centered around disciplinary constructions of trust and of legitimate communication -that pull against convergence.This analysis concludes that communicative plurality and communicative heterogeneity are durable features of the scholarly landscape, and that we are likely to see field differences in the use of and meaning ascribed to communications forums persist, even as overall use of electronic communications technologies both in science and in society as a whole increases.

AB  - Librarians rely on the Institute for Scientific Information's journal impact factor as a tool for selecting periodicals, primarily in scientific disciplines. A current trend is to use this data as a means for evaluating the performance of departments, institutions, and even researchers in academic institutions—a process that is now being tied to tenure and promotion—despite the fact that such usage can be misleading and prejudicial. This paper will highlight the history of the development of impact factors, describe the limitations in their use, and provide a critique of the usage of impact factors in academic settings.

AB  - Digital academic journals serve as the main dissemination method for peer-reviewed research articles. These journals can be divided into two main categories: open access (OA) and non–open access (non-OA) journals. OA literature is defined by Suber as “digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.” 1 The reasons why no-cost OA adoption is slow-going are still largely unexplored, both theoretically and empirically. However, some influential reasons are suggested in the literature: uncertainty or distrust and perceived lower quality or reputation. 2 Distrust can be caused by general skepticism towards new publication technologies and journals, article processing charges (APC), predatory publishers, and low impact factor. 3 Distrust aside, findings by Björk and Salomon indicate that OA literature is approaching the same quality or academic impact as non-OA literature, in addition to maintaining a citation advantage. 4 To our knowledge, no previous research has tested how researchers’ trust and perceived quality interact to influence both OA and non-OA publishing in one integrated study.

AB  - Responding to the extraordinary challenges facing publication in the digital age is the holistic view taken by the Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAf) on threats and opportunities that characterise this conjuncture.Twelve Years Later, researched by Wieland Gevers, Robin Crewe and Susan Veldsman on national publishing strategies, provides the 'nuts 'n bolts' that every researcher should know in order to navigate the changing environment. 1e Report examines both past and present.The first chapter reviews ASSAf's 2006 report. 2 Chapter 2 revisits the 2009 report on books.Chapter 3 details ASSAf's Scholarly Publishing Programme between 2007 and 2018.How to enhance access of South African authors to global commercial publishers is discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 deals with journal and book publishing, and Chapter 6 examines pitfalls and threats to good publishing practices.Outstanding problems are highlighted in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 offers recommendations.Appendices (45 pp) tabulate the hard data on which the study draws.These data showcase close correlations between the ASSAf qualitative evaluations and Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) decisions.Significantly, ASSAf ratings and reviews of publishers closely align with the international Socio-economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment (SENSE) and the Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals, Series and Publishers ratings.The 2018 Report offers a detailed history useful for individual university policy planning, and implementation of monitoring mechanisms, and explains accreditation decisions.A basic cost-benefit analysis of the publication incentive system administered by DHET identifies residual problems.Notwithstanding these (see below), the statistics tabulated in Appendices by the Centre for Research, Evaluation, Science and Technology (CREST) at Stellenbosch University reveals that DHET has been very effective in encouraging publication.It has also acted as an inhibiting factor in author choice of predatory journals, although many thousands of articles still slipped through. 3nuanced analysis of the usefulness or otherwise of impact factors, and the differences that exist between books and journals and high-citation and low-citation disciplines, is provided (pp 4, 18).This section cautions the current moves by some universities that apply impact factors to rank internal disbursements of publication incentives.

AB  - This study assessed characteristics of publishers who published 2010 open access (OA) journals indexed in Scopus. Publishers were categorized into six types; professional, society, university, scholar/researcher, government, and other organizations. Type of publisher was broken down by number of journals/articles published in 2010, funding model, location, discipline and whether the journal was born or converted to OA. Universities and societies accounted for 50% of the journals and 43% of the articles published. Professional publisher accounted for a third of the journals and 42% of the articles. With the exception of professional and scholar/researcher publishers, most journals were originally subscription journals that made at least their digital version freely available. Arts, humanities and social science journals are largely published by societies and universities outside the major publishing countries. Professional OA publishing is most common in biomedicine, mathematics, the sciences and engineering. Approximately a quarter of the journals are hosted on national/international platforms, in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia largely published by universities and societies without the need for publishing fees. This type of collaboration between governments, universities and/or societies may be an effective means of expanding open access publications.

AB  - The current ways in which documents are made freely accessible in the Web no longer adhere to the models established Budapest/Bethesda/Berlin (BBB) definitions of Open Access (OA). Since those definitions were established, OA-related terminology has expanded, trying to keep up with all the variants of OA publishing that are out there. However, the inconsistent and arbitrary terminology that is being used to refer to these variants are complicating communication about OA-related issues. This study intends to initiate a discussion on this issue, by proposing a conceptual model of OA. Our model features six different dimensions (prestige, user rights, stability, immediacy, peer-review, and cost). Each dimension allows for a range of different options. We believe that by combining the options in these six dimensions, we can arrive at all the current variants of OA, while avoiding ambiguous and/or arbitrary terminology. This model can be an useful tool for funders and policy makers who need to decide exactly which aspects of OA are necessary for each specific scenario.

AB  - The rapid advancements in technology have opened up new doors for both teachers and students to explore, learn, and create in innovative ways. However, this progress has also brought forth new challenges and complexities that demand a deeper understanding of the use of technology in art education. In this context, bibliometric analysis has emerged as a potent tool to examine emerging trends in the intersection of technology and art education. Employing the PRISMA approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) and utilizing relevant Scopus databases with standardized procedures that ensure comprehensiveness and replicability, this bibliometric study identified 29 articles. The number of published articles in 2022, at 12, exceeded that of 2021, with only 6. Furthermore, the study highlighted the top 10 countries conducting research in technology and art education, with China having 17 studies, followed by the United States with 3 and Australia with 2. The top three keywords in current research trends are Education Computing, with 9 publications, E-learning, with 8, and Virtual Reality, with 7. Other keywords that relate to technology and art education are also pertinent to the research. These findings suggest that there is a growing interest in utilizing innovative research techniques to examine the intersection of technology and art education. As emerging technologies broaden the horizons of art-making and learning, they offer new avenues for creativity and innovation, but they also demand careful consideration of their potential benefits and risks. Educators and researchers will need to work in tandem to design effective strategies for integrating these technologies in ways that encourage creativity, learning, and social justice.

AB  - A number of attempts have been made to determine the key competencies for librarians supporting scholarly communications (SC), but it remains unclear what technical competencies are required. To explore this issue, the study undertook thematic analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews with UK based librarians working in SC. Typical technologies in use were identified and six typical ways of talking about technologies uncovered. Partly because of the out-sourcing of key technologies, SC librarians need soft skills and certain positive orientations to technology rather than practical technical skills. They acquire these skills through learning on the job and through communities of learning. A concept of socio-technological competence is proposed to encapsulate this skillset.

AB  - Budget cutbacks are the theme of the '90s, and all aspects of advanced education are under intense pressure from severely reduced federal and provincial funding. The realm of scholarly communication is no exception. At a time of rising production costs, reduced postal subsidies, and subscription cancellations from under-funded university libraries, publishers of scholarly journals are now faced with the outright elimination of funding sources such as the Scientific Publication Grants Program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). According to NSERC, the support of scientific journals is a "non-core program" and is therefore being terminated to allow more funding to be directed to research grants. It is difficult to understand how the dissemination of knowledge came to be defined as a non-core program. The goal of ensuring adequate funds for the direct costs of conducting research is certainly laudable. Nevertheless, the loss, through inadequate funding, of scholarly journals as a major forum for scientists to communicate the results of their work has serious consequences for the entire scientific endeavour. There is little point in funding research that will remain unknown to the broader academic community and to Canadian tax-payers who support that community. Such a move could easily result in the research being available only to a privileged few (relatively speaking) through informal networks of communication such as the Internet. ... The move to on-line publishing may somewhat ease the budgetary pressures on journal support programs and university libraries as more and more new journals are offered directly in the electronic media rather than in print. ... Until such time as the print journal has disappeared, publishers will continue to seek ways to make the production process as efficient and cost-effective as possible, while maintaining the quality and integrity of scholarly journals. ... Fiscally responsible journal management means maintaining subscriber rates that will cover the costs of production and distribution. But we need to look elsewhere to cover the myriad other costs associated with scholarly publishing. ...

AB  - Internationalization is important for research quality and for specialization on new themes in the social sciences and humanities (SSH). Interaction with society, however, is just as important in these areas of research for realizing the ultimate aims of knowledge creation. This article demonstrates how the heterogenous publishing patterns of the SSH may reflect and fulfill both purposes. The limited coverage of the SSH in Scopus and Web of Science is discussed along with ideas about how to achieve a more complete representation of all the languages and publication types that are actually used in the SSH. A dynamic and empirical concept of balanced multilingualism is introduced to support combined strategies for internationalization and societal interaction. The argument is that all the communication purposes in all different areas of research, and all the languages and publication types needed to fulfill these purposes, should be considered in a holistic manner without exclusions or priorities whenever research in the SSH is evaluated.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the development of open knowledge in China through two case studies: the development of Chinese open access (OA) journals, and national-level OA repositories. Open access and open knowledge are emerging as a site of both grass-roots activism, and top-down intervention in the practices of scholarship and scholarly publishing in China. Although the language, vision and strategies of the global open knowledge movement are undoubtedly present, so too are the messy realities of open access and open knowledge innovation in a local context. In attempting to position open access developments in China within a diverse and contested global landscape of open knowledge innovation we draw on Moore’s (2017) conception of open access as a boundary object: an object that is understood differently within individual communities but which maintains enough structure to be understood between communities (Moore 2017; Star and Griesemer 1989). Viewed as a boundary object, the concept of open knowledge is making it possible for China to engage with the global open knowledge movement, as a beneficiary of the innovation of others, and as an open knowledge innovator in its own right.

AB  - ABSTRACT Research and scholarly publication are global endeavors, and English‐language journals are receiving more and more manuscript submissions from international authors. A better understanding of the challenges faced by researchers who are not native English speakers will enable journal publishers to improve the process of submission for all authors, ensuring that the best papers are published in an efficient manner. We surveyed a sample of international researchers to determine what they perceived as challenges inherent to submission to English‐language journals and found that they desire assistance with manuscript formatting and responding to reviewers, as well as clear policies about pre‐submission inquiries and conflicts of interest. Taking into account these survey results and the experience our company has with international authors, we suggest several small changes to a journal's website, including clearer English and prominent links to select policies and guidelines, that may greatly simplify the submission process for second language authors.

AB  - The advent of digital scholarship, together with the increasing momentum of open access for research, have thrown scholarly publishing into flux. In the shifting landscape of scholarly communication, libraries are taking on new roles in order to publish scholarship in innovative forms: by building institutional and data repositories, for example, or collaborating with faculty to develop multimedia monographs or open access journals. The Publishing Without Walls project at the University of Illinois is developing a service model for university libraries to support scholar-driven, openly accessible, scalable, and sustainable publishing practices. To this end, we are conducting a multimodal study of scholars' needs, objectives, and practices in this new age of publishing. This poster presents preliminary results of a large-scale survey of scholars, which aims to shed light on what and how scholars want to publish, when and why they choose to publish digitally, and how they understand the success of their digital publications. This survey, in tandem with the results of a series of interviews and focus groups, is actively informing the development of two digital monograph series at the University of Illinois University Library, along with a model for their development that may be useful to other libraries involved with publishing new modes of scholarship.

We interviewed twenty IR end-users recruited through five IRs to discover how they characterize the IR, how/why they use the IR, their credibility judgments in relation to the IR, and their willingness to return to and/or recommend the IR. Despite our small sample size, we were able to ascertain that IR end-users, although not yet loyal IR devotees, recognize their value and unique nature. Our findings also revealed several areas for improvement, such as lack of visibility and transparency

As in its previous iterations, the task is to highlight relevant parts in a reference paper, depending on a citance text excerpt from a citing paper. We participated in tasks 1A (citation identification) and 1B (citation context classification). Contrary to most previous works, we frame Task 1A as a search relevance problem, and introduce a 2-step re-ranking approach, which consists of a preselection based on BM25 in addition to positional document features, and a top-k re-ranking with BERT. For Task 1B, we follow previous submissions in applying methods that deal well with low resources and imbalanced classes.

It also contributes to the discussion of the future of the REF by taking an international perspective. The article offers a framework for understanding differences in the motivations and designs of performance-based research funding systems (PRFS) across countries. It also shows that a basis for mutual learning among countries is more needed than a formulation of best practice, thereby both contributing to and correcting the international outlook in The Metric Tide report and its supplementary Literature Review.

AB  - Funders increasingly mandate researchers to publish their scientific articles in open access and to retain their copyright. Universities all over the world have set up institutional repositories and use repositories for the preservation and dissemination of academic production of their institutions, including scientific articles, reports, datasets, and other research outputs. However, in general, authors do not find institutional repositories very attractive and accessible as an open access publication platform since repositories and open access are not part of the rewarding system. We expect that researchers are more likely to publish and deposit their scientific papers in a repository, once they have the appearance, recognition and dissemination of a scientific journal. That is why we took the initiative to set up a repository based journal 'University Journals' in which universities collaborate. The paper will explain the University Journals project and how the involved universities want to facilitate a valuable alternative publication platform that complies with Plan S principles and enables publication and dissemination of all research outcomes. By establishing University Journals as a publication platform, university libraries are instrumental (and crucial) in achieving the ambitions of Open Science, and universities gain control over the publication process.

AB  - The advent of policies at research-funding organizations requiring grantees to make their funded research openly accessible alters the life cycle of scholarly research. This survey-based study explores the approaches that libraries and research administration offices at the major Canadian universities are employing to support the research-production cycle in an open access era and, in particular, to support researcher adherence to funder open-access requirements. Responses from 21 universities indicated that librarians feel a strong sense of mandate to carry out open access-related activities and provide research supports, while research administrators have a lower sense of mandate and awareness and instead focus largely on assisting researchers with securing grant funding. Canadian research universities already contain infrastructure that could be leveraged to support open access, but maximizing these opportunities requires that research administration offices and university libraries work together more synergistically than they have done traditionally.&#x0D;

AB  - This paper describes our submission for the LongSumm task in SDP 2021. We propose a method for incorporating sentence embeddings produced by deep language models into extractive summarization techniques based on graph centrality in an unsupervised manner.The proposed method is simple, fast, can summarize any kind of document of any size and can satisfy any length constraints for the summaries produced. The method offers competitive performance to more sophisticated supervised methods and can serve as a proxy for abstractive summarization techniques

AB  - While inequalities in science are common, most efforts to understand them treat scientists as isolated individuals, ignoring the network effects of collaboration. Here, we develop models that untangle the network effects of productivity defined as paper counts, and prominence referring to high-impact publications, of individual scientists from their collaboration networks. We find that gendered differences in the productivity and prominence of mid-career researchers can be largely explained by differences in their coauthorship networks. Hence, collaboration networks act as a form of social capital, and we find evidence of their transferability from senior to junior collaborators, with benefits that decay as researchers age. Collaboration network effects can also explain a large proportion of the productivity and prominence advantages held by researchers at prestigious institutions. These results highlight a substantial role of social networks in driving inequalities in science, and suggest that collaboration networks represent an important form of unequally distributed social capital that shapes who makes what scientific discoveries.

AB  - The DCC Curation Lifecycle Model has played a vital role in the field of data curation for over a decade. During that time, the scale and complexity of data have changed dramatically, along with the contexts of data production and use. This paper reports on a study examining factors impacting data curation practices and presents recommendations for updating the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model. The study was grounded in a review of other lifecycle models and informed by a site visit to the Digital Curation Centre and consultation with expert practitioners and researchers. Framed by contemporary conditions impacting the conduct of research and provision of data services, the analysis and proposed recommendations account for the prominence of machine-actionable data, the importance of machine learning for data processing and analytics, growth of integrated research workflows, and escalating concerns with fairness, accountability, and transparency of data and algorithms.

AB  - Double-blind peer review has been proposed as a possible solution to avoid implicit referee bias in academic publishing. The aims of this study are to analyse the demographics of corresponding authors choosing double-blind peer review and to identify differences in the editorial outcome of manuscripts depending on their review model.Data includes 128,454 manuscripts received between March 2015 and February 2017 by 25 Nature-branded journals. We investigated the uptake of double-blind review in relation to journal tier, as well as gender, country, and institutional prestige of the corresponding author. We then studied the manuscripts' editorial outcome in relation to review model and author's characteristics. The gender (male, female, or NA) of the corresponding authors was determined from their first name using a third-party service (Gender API). The prestige of the corresponding author's institutions was measured from the data of the Global Research Identifier Database (GRID) by dividing institutions in three prestige groups with reference to the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) ranking. We employed descriptive statistics for data exploration, and we tested our hypotheses using Pearson's chi-square and binomial tests. We also performed logistic regression modelling with author update, out-to-review, and acceptance as response, and journal tier, author gender, author country, and institution as predictors.Author uptake for double-blind submissions was 12% (12,631 out of 106,373). We found a small but significant association between journal tier and review type (p value < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.054, df = 2). We had gender information for 50,533 corresponding authors and found no statistically significant difference in the distribution of peer review model between males and females (p value = 0.6179). We had 58,920 records with normalised institutions and a THE rank, and we found that corresponding authors from the less prestigious institutions are more likely to choose double-blind review (p value < 0.001, df = 2, Cramer's V = 0.106). In the ten countries with the highest number of submissions, we found a large significant association between country and review type (p value < 0.001, df = 10, Cramer's V = 0.189). The outcome both at first decision and post review is significantly more negative (i.e. a higher likelihood for rejection) for double-blind than single-blind papers (p value < 0.001, df = 1, Cramer's V = 0.112 for first decision; p value < 0.001; df = 1, Cramer's V = 0.082 for post-review decision).The proportion of authors that choose double-blind review is higher when they submit to more prestigious journals, they are affiliated with less prestigious institutions, or they are from specific countries; the double-blind option is also linked to less successful editorial outcomes.

AB  - This study examines the Use and Awareness of N-List resources by the Studentsin SJM College of Arts, Science and Commerce Chitradurga. A survey method was adopted for this study and a well-structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to the students of SJM College of Arts, Science and Commerce. The survey revealed that 97% of respondents have an awareness of N-List e-resources. More than 75% of respondents got awareness about N-List through a user education program conducted by the library. 77% of respondents use N-List resources daily. 'Annual reviews', 'Cambridge University Press' and 'Royal Society of Chemistry' are the most popular e-journals used by the respondents through N-List consortia. Moreover, the E-resources accessed through the N-list program satisfy the majority of respondents. This study recommends that library staff need to conduct periodic orientation and user education programs to create more awareness among library users about E-resources available through N-ListConsortia.

AB  - Most new concepts both in the Russian and English languages are expressed using phrases or compound words, because such complex words make it possible to represent a particular concept with completeness and accuracy. But multicomponent terms—complex words and phrases—are cumbersome; therefore, there is a need to abbreviate them in one way or another. In some cases this leads to the use of short versions of the term in the form of only one main component, while in others, various types of abbreviations are used, which can save time. However, their imprecise or incorrect translation can change or confuse the intended meaning. The paper discusses the differences in using abbreviations and acronyms in British and American scientific texts, as well as difficulties of their translation and optimal strategies of interlanguage adaptation. The investigation is performed using various research techniques, including a comparative method, a continuous sampling method, semantic structure analysis, and contextual analysis. It is shown that the existing modern classifications of abbreviations greatly differ in linguistic scientific literature and lexical units are abbreviated using various methods. It is found that there exist various traditions of their usage in scientific and technical texts. It is demonstrated that various standards for introducing, spelling, and punctuating abbreviations and acronyms in British and American scientific journals pose additional difficulties in the work of a translator in the field of science and technology, provokes translation errors and requires the use of normalization and explication as the main strategies for their translation. The paper may be of interest for those who translate scientific texts for British and American readership.

AB  - Expert testimony is an important part of criminal and civil litigation whenever scientific evidence needs to be explained and interpreted for the judge and jury. Those appearing in court as expert witnesses must possess the necessary qualifications, skill, training, and experience for the task in hand. Unlike a lay-witness, an expert witness is allowed to render an opinion based on their own specialized knowledge and research. In the adversarial system of justice, expert witnesses are hired by opposing sides in a case and this causes confusion when they disagree about the strengths and weaknesses of the scientific evidence presented. Choosing the best expert witness is often a difficult task and making a wrong decision has sometimes led to wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice. Success in science is tightly linked to the quantity and quality of a person's scholarly publications in academic journals in some particular area of research and scholarship. This article describes the use of a publicly available citation database to investigate the publication and citation records of British forensic practitioners with "legal and forensic medicine" (LFM) as their primary or secondary research category. How to attribute credit to individual names on multi-authored articles is a major problem in science and academia. Six different citation metrics, including authorship position on highly cited articles, were used to derive a composite citation score (c-score) for each highly cited scientist. Such bibliometric methods could prove useful in jurisprudence when reviewing the qualifications of people suggested to serve as expert witness in court cases.

AB  - Mobile technologies have become increasingly important in the field of education, providing innovative ways to engage students and enrich their learning experiences. ChatGPT is an innovative tool that can be used in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) classes to engage students, enhance their knowledge and skills, and add variety and interest to the traditional process of learning engineering English, whether accessed through computers or mobile devices. In light of this, the study aims to investigate and compare the attitudes of technical university students and teachers towards using ChatGPT in English classes, as well as their perspectives on academic integrity issues and the strategies they employ when using ChatGPT. The study involved 22 teachers and 60 students from a Ukrainian university. Quantitative research, which involved collecting data through surveys, showed that students exhibited positive attitudes, while teachers took a more neutral approach. Both groups agree that ChatGPT plays a supplementary role in enhancing both hard and soft skills, as well as English language communication skills. However, they emphasized its impact on the development of research skills. The study highlights critical issues related to academic integrity, specifically the differing perceptions of possible violations between students and teachers. The authors present ideas on integrating ChatGPT into ESP classes, enabling teachers to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools for language learning and adapt to changing educational landscapes. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating ChatGPT effectively into engineering English classes to support students’ learning. While emphasizing the importance of guidelines for academic integrity, it also advocates for the creative use of AI tools by teachers and students. Addressing the disparity in attitudes suggests providing teacher professional development to ensure proficient use of AI tools.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research project is to explore the impact of open access initiatives on biomedical research scientific publishing and scholarly communication in Greece. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents the preliminary findings from a longitudinal study that uses bibliometrics, questionnaire surveys and interviews to examine knowledge, awareness and attitudes towards open access. Findings Open access models vary considerably. The bibliometric research indicates that Greek biomedical publication is increasing, but that coverage of Greek medical journals in databases such as MEDLINE is decreasing. The picture is mixed with some evidence of open access journals (published in English) from Greek publishing bases. Awareness of open access among Greek biomedical scientists in date was comparatively low (58 per cent aware, n =70). Research limitations/implications Several Greek medical journals are published in English, and it is difficult to track the authorship for Greek researchers publishing in English language journals published elsewhere. Findings are preliminary as this is a longitudinal survey. Social implications Open access initiatives may privilege researchers from the English speaking world – or those in low income countries. Researchers from countries not in those categories may face unrecognised disadvantages in making their research visible. Originality/value This is the only study of Greek biomedical publishing, and comparisons are being made with similar studies of Spanish biomedical publishing.

AB  - &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; This paper aims to examine the availability of Open Access (OA) research literature in the field of digital library. In order to analyse the availability of OA research literature in the field of digital library, a search was conducted on Web of Science’s Core collection database on June 11, 2019. In response to a topic search TS = “Digital Library” using the advanced search option, 849 articles were retrieved. Of the 849 articles examined, the details of 26 articles were not found in the Google Scholar. Therefore, 823 articles were selected for further analyses. After examining the Websites of OA articles, they were classified into three categories: gold OA, green OA, and both gold and green OA. Furthermore, all the green OA articles were systematically organised into six groups for the examination of the self-archiving venues used by the researchers for self-archiving. Out of 823 articles analysed, OA versions were found for 64.76 per cent of articles. This study found that 26.68 per cent of OA articles were available through gold OA and 60.39 per cent articles were available through green OA, while 36.53 per cent articles were accessible via both OA journals and self-archiving (gold &amp; green OA). Although researchers used various OA platforms for self-archiving of their research work, publishers’ Websites were found as the most preferred choice for self-archiving of research work by the authors in the field of digital library. Computer Science discipline has the highest share of OA copies available through self-archiving. However, it is important to point out that more than 78 per cent of self-archived articles were found as the final publisher’s PDF versions of the article which publishers never allow for self-archiving.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;

AB  - Abstract Knowledge pertaining to scholarly publishing is not limited to information held within academic papers, and within a complex publishing environment that is in constant flux due to challenges and threats, there is interest in knowing how journals are adjusting to these parameters. The Internet Archive is a free and easy way to archive information that is found on websites. We recently argued for its use in the archival of website-based citations, and expand those arguments herein to focus on the importance to archive journal editorial boards, for three reasons: first, journals might not have any formal mechanisms to register changes in the editorial constitution of the board; second, there is historical importance in appreciating changes to editorial board constituency, including changes to gender representation; and third, changes might be made opaquely to hide or masquerade information that is intricately linked to the historical aspect of that journal. Our interest is thus not only within a historical prism, but also from a bibliometric point of view, given that the editorial board defines—to some extent—the journal’s content by serving as its gatekeepers of quality. We attempted to archive the editorial board pages of 46 journal editorial board URLs, achieving 100% mementos.

AB  - We analyzed how often and in what ways the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is currently used in review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) documents of a representative sample of universities from the United States and Canada. 40% of research-intensive institutions and 18% of master’s institutions mentioned the JIF, or closely related terms. Of the institutions that mentioned the JIF, 87% supported its use in at least one of their RPT documents, 13% expressed caution about its use, and none heavily criticized it or prohibited its use. Furthermore, 63% of institutions that mentioned the JIF associated the metric with quality, 40% with impact, importance, or significance, and 20% with prestige, reputation, or status. We conclude that use of the JIF is encouraged in RPT evaluations, especially at research-intensive universities, and that there is work to be done to avoid the potential misuse of metrics like the JIF.

AB  - Enabling and supporting discoverability of research outputs and datasets are key functions of university and academic health center institutional repositories. Yet adoption rates among potential repository users are hampered by a number of factors, prominent among which are difficulties with basic usability. In their efforts to implement a local instance of InvenioRDM, a turnkey next generation repository, team members at Northwestern University’s Galter Health Sciences Library &amp; Learning Center supplemented agile development principles and methods and a user experience design-centered approach with observations of users’ microinteractions (interactions with each part of the software’s interface that requires human intervention). Microinteractions were observed through user testing sessions conducted in Fall 2019. The result has been a more user-informed development effort incorporating the experiences and viewpoints of a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning multiple departments of a highly ranked research university.

AB  - Abstract This paper investigates different uses of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) in national journal rankings and discusses the merits of supplementing metrics with expert assessment. Our focus is national journal rankings used as evidence to support decisions about the distribution of institutional funding or career advancement. The seven countries under comparison are China, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Poland, and Turkey—and the region of Flanders in Belgium. With the exception of Italy, top‐tier journals used in national rankings include those classified at the highest level, or according to tier, or points implemented. A total of 3,565 (75.8%) out of 4,701 unique top‐tier journals were identified as having a JIF, with 55.7% belonging to the first Journal Impact Factor quartile. Journal rankings in China, Flanders, Poland, and Turkey classify journals with a JIF as being top‐tier, but only when they are in the first quartile of the Average Journal Impact Factor Percentile. Journal rankings that result from expert assessment in Denmark, Finland, and Norway regularly classify journals as top‐tier outside the first quartile, particularly in the social sciences and humanities. We conclude that experts, when tasked with metric‐informed journal rankings, take into account quality dimensions that are not covered by JIFs.

AB  - First posted April 15, 2013 For additional information, contact: Core Science SystemsU.S. Geological Survey12201 Sunrise Valley DriveReston, VA 20192 Core Science Systems is a new mission of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that resulted from the 2007 Science Strategy, “Facing Tomorrow’s Challenges: U.S. Geological Survey Science in the Decade 2007–2017.” This report describes the Core Science Systems vision and outlines a strategy to facilitate integrated characterization and understanding of the complex Earth system. The vision and suggested actions are bold and far-reaching, describing a conceptual model and framework to enhance the ability of the USGS to bring its core strengths to bear on pressing societal problems through data integration and scientific synthesis across the breadth of science.The context of this report is inspired by a direction set forth in the 2007 Science Strategy. Specifically, ecosystem-based approaches provide the underpinnings for essentially all science themes that define the USGS. Every point on Earth falls within a specific ecosystem where data, other information assets, and the expertise of USGS and its many partners can be employed to quantitatively understand how that ecosystem functions and how it responds to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Every benefit society obtains from the planet— food, water, raw materials to build infrastructure, homes and automobiles, fuel to heat homes and cities, and many others— are derived from or affect ecosystems.The vision for Core Science Systems builds on core strengths of the USGS in characterizing and understanding complex Earth and biological systems through research, modeling, mapping, and the production of high quality data on the Nation’s natural resource infrastructure. Together, these research activities provide a foundation for ecosystem-based approaches through geologic mapping, topographic mapping, and biodiversity mapping. The vision describes a framework founded on these core mapping strengths that makes it easier for USGS scientists to discover critical information, share and publish results, and identify potential collaborations that transcend all USGS missions. The framework is designed to improve the efficiency of scientific work within USGS by establishing a means to preserve and recall data for future applications, organizing existing scientific knowledge and data to facilitate new use of older information, and establishing a future workflow that naturally integrates new data, applications, and other science products to make interdisciplinary research easier and more efficient. Given the increasing need for integrated data and interdisciplinary approaches to solve modern problems, leadership by the Core Science Systems mission will facilitate problem solving by all USGS missions in ways not formerly possible.The report lays out a strategy to achieve this vision through three goals with accompanying objectives and actions. The first goal builds on and enhances the strengths of the Core Science Systems mission in characterizing and understanding the Earth system from the geologic framework to the topographic characteristics of the land surface and biodiversity across the Nation. The second goal enhances and develops new strengths in computer and information science to make it easier for USGS scientists to discover data and models, share and publish results, and discover connections between scientific information and knowledge. The third goal brings additional focus to research and development methods to address complex issues affecting society that require integration of knowledge and new methods for synthesizing scientific information. Collectively, the report lays out a strategy to create a seamless connection between all USGS activities to accelerate and make USGS science more efficient by fully integrating disciplinary expertise within a new and evolving science paradigm for a changing world in the 21st century.

TI  - Using a Community of Practice Approach to Transform: How an Academic Library Collections Unit Reorganized to Meet Growing Demands for E-Resources and Services During a Time of Institutional Change
AU  - Abresch, John
C1  - Purdue University Purdue University Purdue e-Pubs Purdue e-Pubs
AB  - In recent years, technical services operations and collection management at the University of South Florida (USF) Library was operating with flat budgets, a staff organization in a state of transition, ineffective workplace communication, and a progressive loss of institutional knowledge and skill sets. During the same time, the university was characterized by a fast‐developing dynamic research and learning environment. New research endeavors and academic programs were incorporating a variety of electronic resources in their activities. In response, library administrators implemented a strategy of organizing technical services operations into a community of practice with three key elements. The three elements included redefining technical staff organization, enhancing collaboration and communication, and building new work areas. This paper illustrates how the technical services operations at USF was remodeled by modifying staff organization and workspaces into collaborative teams. The team approach has focused skill sets on multiformat collection problem solving and enhanced service delivery to library patrons. The reorganization has transformed a department previously centered on processing print publications to a department focused on managing diverse activities including evidence‐based acquisitions programs in both e‐book and streaming formats as well as diverse e‐journal and database subscriptions. The new Collections & Discovery Unit has a shared mission and vision. The unit staff members have built a knowledge base of diverse information and solutions to meet the challenges of a fast‐changing academic landscape.

AB  - ABSTRACT There is a strong history of social science research within Latin America, but its visibility (both within and outside the region) has been low for reasons of language and print distribution. The introduction of the Internet and online publication makes this information potentially more visible to the global research community, and within Latin America several organizations have undertaken to exploit this opportunity. The approaches taken show how collaboration between countries, and particularly between librarians and publishers, can provide innovative solutions. The CLACSO project uses a digital library model as a publishing platform for its member journals and this has provided a successful – and hopefully sustainable – model.

AB  - To meet the research, teaching, and learning needs of their users, academic librarians, particularly those functioning as subject liaisons, are expected to know the institution’s curriculum and research areas so that they can help shape library strategies to meet those needs and to connect users to the library’s resources and services. The present study investigated the use of Refinitiv’s free web demo, Open Calais, as a text mining tool to help learn about the research areas in the University of Tennessee’s Tickle College of Engineering. We investigated the following research questions: What interdisciplinary research areas in the College does Open Calais reveal? What are the differences in Open Calais’ tagging of Scopus and web pages? What terms were uncovered by Open Calais that were unexpected by the subject librarian? The results showed a mixed picture of the usefulness of Open Calais for learning the research areas of the College of Engineering.

AB  - Abstract Open Access (OA) publishing has progressed from an initial fringe idea to a still‐growing, major component of modern academic communication. The proliferation of OA publishing presents a context to examine how new innovations and institutions develop. Based on analyses of 1,296,304 articles published in 83 OA journals, we analyze changes in the institutional status, gender, age, citedness, and geographical locations of authors over time. Generally, OA journals tended towards core‐to‐periphery diffusion patterns. Specifically, journal authors tended to decrease in high‐status institutional affiliations, male and highly cited authors over time. Despite these general tendencies, there was substantial variation in the diffusion patterns of OA journals. Some journals exhibited no significant demographic changes, and a few exhibited periphery‐to‐core diffusion patterns. We find that although both highly and less‐legitimate journals generally exhibit core‐to‐periphery diffusion patterns, there are still demographic differences between such journals. Institutional and cultural legitimacy—or lack thereof—affects the social and intellectual diffusion of new OA journals.

AB  - A library’s Web site can provide a powerful forum for communicating with users about changes occurring in local collecting practices and their relationship to larger issues of scholarly communication. This survey of SPARC member Web sites examines how information on collection changes and scholarly communication issues is presented. Although a few institutions use their Web sites to inform users and connect the local and the global, most present little or no informationon these topics. When collections information is present, it usually appears on either dedicated collections pages or faculty services pages. Typically, collections pages focus on largely static information describing services and policies. Information on changes in collection building is uncommon. Scholarly communication information is even scarcer and is rarely linked to information on local collection development or management.

AB  - Web Presence of Repositories of Indian Institutes of Technology: A Webometric Study Dr. Babita Jaiswal, Richa Arya Abstract Links weave web documents together in a complex, structured hypertext corpus. Web links studies have been conducted by the scholars and information professionals all over the world since its introduction. The main objective of the study is to investigate the web presence of repositories of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) as a part of the World Wide Web. To investigate the web presence the few sub-objectives have been framed such as to identify IITs which are having their repositories; to find out the TLD, cc TLD and file formats use by the repositories; to find out total number of Web Pages, Link Web Pages, Self Link Web Pages, External Link Web Pages and Inlink Web Pages; to calculate Overall Web Impact Factor, Simple Web Impact Factor, Self Link Web Impact Factor, External Link Web Impact Factor and Inlink Web Impact Factor. Google covers more hyperlinks with advanced search facilities to count links possessed by the websites. Therefore, the present study has used Google to collect raw data, i.e., number of web pages, number of inlinks, self links and external links etc. Boolean operators are also used to form query syntaxes for retrieving data. SocSciBot web crawler is also employed. It is used to create network map of all the websites. URLs/websites of repositories are tested through command line textual queries like link, linkdomain, site, etc. Findings have been derived after analyzing the data.

AB  - SUMMARY In dealing with the “serials crisis” over the years, librarians have often called upon faculty authors and editors in other disciplines to be more “responsible” in their publishing behaviors by, for example, not working with journals that routinely engage in sizable increases in subscription prices. The issuance of Declaring Independence: A Guide to Creating Community Controlled Science Journals by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) and the Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN) in 2001 provided Chaffin with a framework for comparison of journals in library and information science with those in other disciplines more commonly cited as culprits in producing the “serials crisis.” Comparisons of three years of data on annual subscription prices in journals, copyright policies, and use of alternate publishing models for library and information science, physics, and sociology revealed no significant differences in journals by disciplinary fields. The finding that librarians and information scientists behaved no better than those in field commonly cited for behaving “irresponsibly” prompted both the title of this workshop-inspired by Walt Kelley's Pogo comic strip-and much stimulating discussion within it.

AB  - To assess the amount, relevance, content, and suppressibility of academic electronic spam invitations to attend conferences or submit manuscripts. Prospective cohort study. Email accounts of participating academics. Five intrepid academics and a great many publishers, editors, and conference organisers. Unsubscribing from sender's distribution lists. Number of spam invitations received before, immediately after, and one year after unsubscribing from senders' distribution lists. The proportion of duplicate invitations was also assessed and the relevance of each invitation graded to the recipient's research interests. A qualitative assessment of the content of spam invitations was conducted. At baseline, recipients received an average of 312 spam invitations each month. Unsubscribing reduced the frequency of the invitations by 39% after one month but by only 19% after one year. Overall, 16% of spam invitations were duplicates and 83% had little or no relevance to the recipients' research interests. Spam invitations were characterised by inventive language, flattery, and exuberance, and they were sometimes baffling and amusing. Academic spam is common, repetitive, often irrelevant, and difficult to avoid or prevent.

TI  - What about prestige in gold Open Access publishing – a survey investigating publication patterns of researchers at Swedish universities
IS  - 5
AU  - Lindelöw, Camilla
AB  - Fully gold Open Access (OA) publication channels are still hold to be of inferior quality compared to channels offered by publishers with traditional subscription business models, albeit less and less so. The threat of predatory publishers looms on one side, and on the other most OA publishers haven’t been around to gather prestige for so long. Still, there seems to be a steady advance. For example, OA publication channels may now be found at level two (indexing the channels perceived as having most academic prestige in a certain subject) of the Norwegian Publication Model (NPM).In an earlier survey, I investigated the publication patterns of researchers at Swedish universities with focus on their gold OA publishing in journals. The publication patterns were contrasted with the occurrence of OA journals in NPM. 29 % of the DOAJ journals were present as approved channels in NPM. DOAJ is frequently mentioned as the most comprehensive OA journal indexing service in the world. At level one, 14 % of the listed journals were OA, whereas only 2 % of level two journals were OA. Out of the DOAJ-journals included in NPM, only 1 % made it to level two. This is probably explained by the situation described above; OA journals are often new to the scientific publishing market, and therefore they haven’t had the time to gather academic prestige.The OA journals that researchers at Swedish universities published were almost all of them present in DOAJ. 7 % of these were at level two. This pattern seems to imply that researchers are trying to fulfil demands of OA publishing from funders, while at the same time trying to gather prestige for their own researcher career. This poster aims to further explore these results, with focus on the 7 % journals at level 2. Which journals can be found here, and what is the distribution? Which research subjects are involved?

TI  - What Are the Characteristics of Canadian Independent, Scholarly Journals? Results from a Website Analysis

AB  - The dominance of commercial publishers (Larivière, Haustein, and Mongeon 2015) has led to a discussion in Canada focusing on alternative models for supporting independent, non-commercial, scholarly journals. Although small in number, these journals represent an important contribution to Canadian and global scholarship. They also act as a counterbalance to the increasingly for-profit nature of scholarly publishing. Despite their importance, there exists no definitive list of journals of this nature in Canada, making analysis and understanding of their characteristics difficult.In order to address this gap, the researchers undertook an analysis of the websites of 485 Canadian, independent, scholarly journals. Independent was defined as journals which are not affiliated with a commercial publisher. The researchers gathered data for each journal on their access type (e.g., closed, open access), subject area, size and composition of the editorial team, and any affiliation(s). This data was then analyzed to create a portrait of these journals with these themes. The researchers found that most of these journals were affiliated with at least one organization, with over half being associated with two or more. They also discovered that affiliations varied depending on the discipline and that the size of the editorial team was correlated to the access type. Journals were predominantly in the humanities and social sciences, and the majority were open access (OA) without article processing charges (APCs).While the focus of this study is on Canadian journals, this article provides a framework for other researchers to examine non-commercial, independent publishing in their own countries. Its results also provide preliminary data which may inspire future avenues of research, particularly into models for non-APC, open access journals as well as the editorial board structure and size for independent journals.

AB  - More university presses and academic libraries have started to collaborate in the scholarly publishing field, and it becomes important to investigate how this message of collaboration has been delivered to the academic community, since this community includes both creators and users of scholarly works. This study collects 23 news articles on the collaboration between university presses and academic libraries from the formal news sites of the affiliated institutions and then conducts content analysis on these articles, focusing on their content coverage and purposes. These news articles covered topics including the background and benefits of collaboration, how the collaboration worked/would work, and how libraries and presses can contribute to the collaboration. The analysis reveals that these news articles aim not only to inform their readers about the collaboration, but also to provide rationales to the collaboration. The news articles also demonstrate an unbalanced depiction between press and library by focusing more on the press, and this study interprets this phenomenon as a result of two assumptions held by the news articles: the audience’s unfamiliarity with the press and more challenging financial viability issues the press encountered.

AB  - Key points Peer review, the cornerstone of academic publishing, has come under a lot of criticism for its flaws and has been manipulated by both authors and editors. Lack of review transparency is a contributing factor to peer review problems. Pressure to publish – among authors and journals – is adding to peer review problems. Technology can help maintain review integrity, although editorial vigilance remains key.

On a very practical level, authors value timely peer review, perhaps above anything else. The perceived drop in copyediting and production quality is a common author gripe. Publishers need to be open about open access – many authors are not as knowledgeable as assumed.

C1  - Loughborough University, UK
AB  - Traces the 12-year self-archiving policy journey of the original 107 publishers listed on the SHERPA/RoMEO Publisher Policy Database in 2004, through to 2015. Maps the RoMEO colour codes (‘green’, ‘blue’, ‘yellow’ and ‘white’) and related restrictions and conditions over time. Finds that while the volume of publishers allowing some form of self-archiving (pre-print, post-print or both) has increased by 12% over the 12 years, the volume of restrictions around how, where and when self-archiving may take place has increased 119%, 190% and 1000% respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the increase in self-archiving restrictions and the introduction of Gold paid open access options. Suggests that by conveying only the version of a paper that authors may self-archive, the RoMEO colour codes do not address all the key elements of the Bethesda Definition of Open Access. Compares the number of RoMEO ‘green’ publishers over time with those meeting the definition for ‘redefined green’ (allowing embargo-free deposit of the post-print in an institutional repository). Finds that RoMEO ‘green’ increased by 8% and ‘redefined green’ decreased by 35% over the 12 years. Concludes that the RoMEO colour codes no longer convey a commitment to green open access as originally intended. Calls for open access advocates, funders, institutions and authors to redefine what ‘green’ means to better reflect a publisher’s commitment to self-archiving.

AB  - In recent years, increased stakeholder pressure to transition research to Open Access has led to many journals converting, or 'flipping', from a closed access (CA) to an open access (OA) publishing model. Changing the publishing model can influence the decision of authors to submit their papers to a journal, and increased article accessibility may influence citation behaviour. In this paper we aimed to understand how flipping a journal to an OA model influences the journal's future publication volumes and citation impact. We analysed two independent sets of journals that had flipped to an OA model, one from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and one from the Open Access Directory (OAD), and compared their development with two respective control groups of similar journals. For bibliometric analyses, journals were matched to the Scopus database. We assessed changes in the number of articles published over time, as well as two citation metrics at the journal and article level: the normalised impact factor (IF) and the average relative citations (ARC), respectively. Our results show that overall, journals that flipped to an OA model increased their publication output compared to journals that remained closed. Mean normalised IF and ARC also generally increased following the flip to an OA model, at a greater rate than was observed in the control groups. However, the changes appear to vary largely by scientific discipline. Overall, these results indicate that flipping to an OA publishing model can bring positive changes to a journal.

AB  - This article represents the study of Ukrainian legislative documents in order to define, how they promote scientific quality, performance and excellence.The research management problem is defined as a limitation to use direct research and knowledge management and a reason for implementation of indirect criteria.The study shows that aims, principles and requirements on scientific quality, excellence and performance as motivated proposals mainly absent in Ukrainian legislation and they have no systemic context for realization.It is noted, that an operative use of scientific degrees and academic titles as criteria of scientific quality leads to the weakness of policy, because they mainly represent the social status and qualification.Another weaken position in legislation is an absence of requirements for research assessment of individual scientists in order to stimulate research excellence and competition between them.The main result is that socioeconomic transformations may damage the unity of research policy, legislation and management and change the values of cognitive and creative activities.

AB  - This article is a first-hand account of the author's work identifying and listing predatory publishers from 2012 to 2017. Predatory publishers use the gold (author pays) open access model and aim to generate as much revenue as possible, often foregoing a proper peer review. The paper details how predatory publishers came to exist and shows how they were largely enabled and condoned by the open-access social movement, the scholarly publishing industry, and academic librarians. The author describes tactics predatory publishers used to attempt to be removed from his lists, details the damage predatory journals cause to science, and comments on the future of scholarly publishing.

AB  - There is a broad difference of opinion among the many stakeholders in scholarly publishing about how to precisely define open access publishing. Are “open access” and “open data” what we mean by open? Does “open” mean anything else? Does it mean “to make available,” or “to make freely available in a particular format?” Is a clearer definition needed (or maybe just better education on the current definition)? Why or why not? At present, some stakeholders see public access as being an acceptable stopping point in the move toward open access. Others see “open” as requiring free and immediate access with articles being available in CC-BY format. The range of opinions between these extremes is vast. How should these differences be decided? Who should decide? Is it possible to make binding recommendations (and how)? Is consensus necessary? What are the consequences of the lack of consensus?

AB  - Academics and librarians around the world are raising concern about the current state of scholarly journal publishing in that the majority of journals are under the control of five multinational commercial journal publishing companies. Some are advocating for scholars to take back control of scholarly communication, particularly because it is the academics who are supplying and managing most of the content for journals. Open access publishing is one option, but the question of sustainability in funding streams raises concerns. Also the roles of scholarly societies, academic association, and universities in looking for stability in nonprofit journal publishing are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION This paper explores the variability in self-identifying practices of academic libraries engaged in journal publishing and hosting activities. We were interested in how libraries characterized their efforts in this area and looked at whether there is an unspoken threshold for differentiation with respect to publishing-support naming conventions. METHODS Using the Library Publishing Directory, in-depth interviews, and a more widely circulated follow-up survey, the research team examined service offerings, divisions of responsibility, funding, terminology, and semantic associations within publishing, both as an active practice and as an advertised service. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We aimed to tease out whether there was any sort of tipping point, or inferred rules, around when an institution chose to call the activity either publishing or hosting. We found no particular service, set of services, funding structure, or division of labor that obviously influenced the use of a particular term. Rather than noting a divide between publishing and hosting, participants spoke of both a spectrum and a tiering of work and support, though all emphasized that these models did not describe the quality of the work produced. This paper also discusses how use of the term library publishing creates additional ambiguity in naming practices, and considers some implications for library staff newly immersed in scholarly publishing work.

AB  - SUMMARY This paper is based on a presentation given by Ken Frazier in tandem with Loretta Ebert. The term "Big Deal" is used to describe licensing agreements that provide expanded or complete access to the e-journal content of major publishers. The author discusses the liabilities and opportunities created by a library collection development strategy that avoids buying into Big Deals and focuses instead on journal cost-effectiveness. Even the most cost-effective Big Deals are not financially sustainable and can, at best, provide a transition to a more open and affordable scholarly communication system.

AB  - SUMMARY This paper is based on a presentation given by Loretta Ebert, Director of the Rensselaer Research Libraries at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. It followed a presentation given by Kenneth Frazier similarly titled, “What's the Big Deal?” in which he discussed his institution's rationale for avoiding Big Deals. In this paper, the utilization of the Big Deal by a consortium of independent academic libraries in New York State provides an example of emerging models of collaboration among libraries that demonstrate cost-effective use of Big Deals, value-added collections and improved access for scholars regardless of their institutional affiliations. A shared electronic collection provides a case study for analyzing variable cost and usage data across members of a consortium and the elements that contributed to a successful collaboration.

AB  - At first sight the “big (or all‐you‐can‐eat) deal” seems excellent value for libraries and their users, and represents the shining possibilities of the electronic age. A more thorough‐going evaluation, however, exposes dangers for universities, their funders and publishers. This paper examines the big deal in the light of fundamental market conditions and suggests alternative models for procuring electronic resources. The roles and strengths of the players in the information supply chain are defined and traditional hard‐copy procurement is analysed in terms of these roles and the concepts of authority, branding and monopoly. The fundamentals of procuring electronic resources and prevalent purchasing models are discussed in terms of the same roles and concepts. The advantages of the big deal are laid out ‐ access to resources, low unit costs etc. The dangers are also discussed. These arise mainly from the publishers’ position as monopolists. The possible long‐term effects, on library budgets and academic publishing, of dealing with monopoly suppliers are examined. Means of avoiding or minimising these dangers – consortia, alternative publishing methods, new economic models to promote competition – are examined.

The UIC has been hosting Internet-based journals since the 1990s. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, challenges and steps taken for inclusion in PubMed, archiving in PubMed Central and developing policies and parameters of support are discussed. Findings – Venturing into the world of Library as Publisher is not the decision that should be taken lightly, but supporting affordable scholarly publishing, when successful, is rewarding. Originality/value – This paper will be of value to libraries considering offering journal hosting services.

AB  - This paper aims to address the issue of predatory publishing, sensu lato. To achieve this, we offer our perspectives, starting initially with some background surrounding the birth of the concept, even though the phenomenon may have already existed long before the popularization of the term "predatory publishing". The issue of predation or "predatory" behavior in academic publishing is no longer limited to open access (OA). Many of the mainstream publishers that were exclusively subscription-based are now evolving towards a state of complete OA. Academics seeking reliable sources of journals to publish their work tend to rely on a journal's metrics such as citations and indexing, and on whether it is blacklisted or whitelisted. Jeffrey Beall raised awareness of the risks of "predatory" OA publishing, and his blacklists of "predatory" OA journals and publishers began to be used for official purposes to distinguish valid from perceived invalid publishing venues. We initially reflect on why we believe the blacklists created by Beall were flawed, primarily due to the weak set of criteria confusing non-predatory with true predatory journals leading to false positives and missing out on blacklisting true predatory journals due to false negatives. Historically, most critiques of "predatory publishing" have relied excessively on Beall's blacklists to base their assumptions and conclusions but there is a need to look beyond these. There are currently a number of blacklists and whitelists circulating in academia, but they all have imperfections, such as the resurrected Beall blacklists, Crawford's OA gray list based on Beall's lists, Cabell's new blacklist with about 11,000 journals, the DOAJ with about 11,700 OA journals, and UGC, with over 32,600 journals prior to its recent (May 2018) purge of 4305 journals. The reader is led into a discussion about blacklists' lack of reliability, using the scientific framework of conducting research to assess whether a journal could be predatory at the pre- and post-study levels. We close our discussion by offering arguments why we believe blacklists are academically invalid.

AB  - In this column, Mike Furlough writes about repositories from a user services perspective. His engaging and accessible article provides a fascinating history of hype, a primer on technical tools, and thoughtful reflections on the future of institutional repositories. Mike Furlough joined The Pennsylvania State University Libraries in 2006 as the assistant dean for Scholarly Communications and co-director of the Office of Digital Scholarly Publishing. Furlough's graduate training is in American Literature, but he ran away to join the University of Virginia Library, where he developed and led a number of services to support digital scholarship. He currently serves as a member of the Association of College and Research Libraries' Scholarly Communications Committee and begins editing a column on that topic for CR a vault or sepulchre. (1) Institutional repository (IR) often refers to a service that supports and encourages the deposit of student- and faculty-created materials, primarily open-access versions of research articles that have been formally published elsewhere or not at all. The early energy surrounding IRs centered on a hope that promoting open access could serve as a countermeasure to commercial publishing power and its ability to distort the market for knowledge. Taking control of our institutions' research by providing the ability to distribute this information to the world in an open-access mode seemed to be an inevitable outcome of the Internet. What follows is a brief history of IR hype. In July 2002, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported 'Superarchives' Could Hold All Scholarly Output: Online Collections by Institutions May Challenge the Role of Journal Publishers. (2) Also in 2002, a Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) position paper declared that institutional repositories--digital collections capturing and preserving the intellectual output of a single or multi-university community.... provide a critical component in reforming the system of scholarly communication--a component that expands access to research, reasserts control over scholarship by the academy, increases competition and reduces the monopoly power of journals, and brings economic relief and heightened relevance to the institutions and libraries that support them. (3) But in 2004 The Chronicle provided an update: Papers Wanted: Online Archives Run by Universities Struggle to Attract Material. (4) IRs soon became the butt of jokes, even inside the community of practitioners. In March 2006, Dorothea Salo, an institutional manager, rechristened herself in her blog. …

AB  - Is it possible to predict the future of serials work? Not with perfect accuracy, of course - but to do so imperfectly is both possible and imperative.We need to be looking ahead and asking questions like these: What are the implications of the open access movement for serials staff? Will the information economy of the future be driven by problems of scarcity or problems of abundance, and what does each scenario mean for the library? The areas in which we work are especially volatile, and both we and those we serve will benefit greatly if we learn how to anticipate and prepare for change, rather than simply reacting to it after it happens.

AB  - In theory, articles can attract readers on the social reference sharing site M endeley before they can attract citations, so M endeley altmetrics could provide early indications of article impact. This article investigates the influence of time on the number of M endeley readers of an article through a theoretical discussion and an investigation into the relationship between counts of readers of, and citations to, 4 general library and information science ( LIS ) journals. For this discipline, it takes about 7 years for articles to attract as many S copus citations as M endeley readers, and after this the S pearman correlation between readers and citers is stable at about 0.6 for all years. This suggests that M endeley readership counts may be useful impact indicators for both newer and older articles. The lack of dates for individual M endeley article readers and an unknown bias toward more recent articles mean that readership data should be normalized individually by year, however, before making any comparisons between articles published in different years.

C1  - †Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India
AB  - To this date, the efficacy of the scientific publishing enterprise fundamentally rests on the strength of the peer review process. The journal editor or the conference chair primarily relies on the expert reviewers’ assessment, identify points of agreement and disagreement and try to reach a consensus to make a fair and informed decision on whether to accept or reject a paper. However, with the escalating number of submissions requiring review, especially in top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences, the editor/chair, among many other works, invests a significant, sometimes stressful effort to mitigate reviewer disagreements. Here in this work, we introduce a novel task of automatically identifying contradictions among reviewers on a given article. To this end, we introduce ContraSciView, a comprehensive review-pair contradiction dataset on around 8.5k papers (with around 28k review pairs containing nearly 50k review pair comments) from the open review-based ICLR and NeurIPS conferences. We further propose a baseline model that detects contradictory statements from the review pairs. To the best of our knowledge, we make the first attempt to identify disagreements among peer reviewers automatically. We make our dataset and code public for further investigations.

AU  - Cadena, Cara

C1  - Grand Valley State University,
AB  - Due to impending campus-wide downsizing, the Grand Valley State University (GVSU) Libraries projected that a worst-case scenario would result in a 14% cut to the library’s collections budget for fiscal year 2020. In the same year, GVSU Libraries welcomed several new members of its leadership team, including the dean, two associate deans, head of systems, head of collections, business administrator, and a vacancy after the long-time acquisitions manager retired. Budget cuts and staff turnover are tough, but they prompted a much-needed reassessment of roles, culture, and priorities in the library. Different approaches to spending and curating the library’s collections were vital to counteract the budgetary challenges. Cara Cadena, the new head of collections, was charged with building a task force to recommend cancellations and a plan to communicate these changes across campus. Decisions were made based on feedback gathered from teaching faculty, liaison librarians, campus stakeholders, and usage data. Ultimately, the communication plan proved to be the most critical--and challenging--part of the process. In this session, Cara and Marcia will discuss successes, missteps, results, the importance of vendor relationships, and future plans for collection management at GVSU. Attendees will gain insights into leveraging stakeholder buy-in and grasping opportunities amidst constant change (and decreased funding) in order to evolve effectively. They’ll also learn how GVSU Libraries are reimagining the role of the collections team.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to report the findings of a study of publishing behaviour among a group of Arab scholars in social science and humanities disciplines. The paper also investigated the number of Arab scholars who are publishing in predatory journals and the reasons that drive them to select these journals to share their scholarly findings. The study adopted a mixed methods approach. Eighteen journals that were categorized as predatory journals were scanned to find the number of Arab scholars who published in them. Then, a questionnaire was sent to Egyptian and Saudi scholars as they were found to be the top Arab contributors in these journals. The questionnaire was followed by semi‐structured interviews to gain an in‐depth understanding of the publishing behaviour. The data showed that many Arab scholars prefer publishing in predatory journals as these journals are easier and faster. The results also indicate that there is a need to raise the awareness of the harm that predatory journals can cause to the scholars and how they can avoid these journals. This study was conducted with social science and humanities scholars in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The publishing behaviour may differ in other scholarly disciplines and other Arabic countries.

AU  - Schultz, Jonathan
AB  - In the end, 2020—the year that lasted forever—will likely be an accelerant. The lasting changes to scientific publishing and communication will be those that have been simmering for a while, but only came to a boil because of this turbulent year. One of the clearest examples of this is the likely permanence of the remote workplace for information workers, such as those in scholarly publishing. A look through the CSE Annual Meeting report archive will find a decade’s worth of articles on how to support a remote team, but many organizations remained hesitant or only allowed staff to work a few days from home. Now with everyone forced out of offices for what will likely be at least a year, many of those office spaces may not reopen, or when they do, they’ll shift focus to meeting spaces and shared desks for staff to use as needed. The full implication of this move is unknown, but one certain positive of the remote workforce is the pool of applicants for any position expands from a few dozen locals to literally thousands of potentially talented individuals. That change will be important as organizations attempt to address inequities brought to light (again) during the racial reckoning of this summer.

AB  - The paper intends to help scientific authors to make the best choice of journals in which to publish, by describing and comparing journal features in the area of oncology. For this purpose, the authors identified impact factor (IF) ranking, cost options and copyright conditions offered to authors wishing to publish in full open access (OA), subscription-based or hybrid journals.Data referring to articles published in 2010 by three Italian research institutions (National Institute of Health - Rome (ISS), Regina Elena National Cancer Institute - Rome (IRE), National Cancer Institute - Milan (INT) in journals (78) managed according to different business models, all listed in the Journal Citation Reports, subject category Oncology, were collected and analysed. The journals surveyed were ranked according to IF, position in quartiles, publication charges, usage rights in published articles, self-archiving conditions in OAI-compliant repositories digital archives.Almost half (34) the journals surveyed were included in the first quartile, thus revealing authors' preference for journals with a high IF. The prevalent journal business model was the hybrid formula (based on subscriptions but also offering a paid OA option) with 51 journals, followed by subscription-based only journals accounting for 22, while just 5 full OA journals were identified. In general, no relationship was found between IF and article publication charges, in terms of correspondence between more expensive fees and higher IF.The issue of OA journals as compared with traditional subscription-based journals is highly debated among stakeholders: library administrators facing financial restrictions, authors seeking to locate the best outlet for their research, publishers wishing to increase their revenues by offering journals with wider appeal. Against this background, factors such as the quest for alternatives to high-cost business models, investments in setting up institutional repositories hosting the published versions of articles and efforts to overcome copyright barriers and gain free access to scientific literature are all crucial.

AB  - Purpose How to obtain a list of the 100 largest scientific publishers sorted by journal count? Existing databases are unhelpful as each of them inhere biased omissions and data quality flaws. This paper tries to fill this gap with an alternative approach. Design/methodology/approach The content coverages of Scopus, Publons, DOAJ and SherpaRomeo were first used to extract a preliminary list of publishers that supposedly possess at least 15 journals. Second, the publishers' websites were scraped to fetch their portfolios and, thus, their “true” journal counts. Findings The outcome is a list of the 100 largest publishers comprising 28.060 scholarly journals, with the largest publishing 3.763 journals, and the smallest carrying 76 titles. The usual “oligopoly” of major publishing companies leads the list, but it also contains 17 university presses from the Global South, and, surprisingly, 30 predatory publishers that together publish 4.517 journals. Research limitations/implications Additional data sources could be used to mitigate remaining biases; it is difficult to disambiguate publisher names and their imprints; and the dataset carries a non-uniform distribution, thus risking the omission of data points in the lower range. Practical implications The dataset can serve as a useful basis for comprehensive meta-scientific surveys on the publisher-level. Originality/value The catalogue can be deemed more inclusive and diverse than other ones because many of the publishers would have been overlooked if one had drawn from merely one or two sources. The list is freely accessible and invites regular updates. The approach used here (webscraping) has seldomly been used in meta-scientific surveys.

AB  - Abstract In this paper we study the diversity of users of open access articles on the Finnish Journal.fi platform. This platform hosts around hundred open access journals from Finland publishing in different fields and mainly Finnish and English languages. The study is based on an online survey, conducted on 48 journals during Spring 2020, in which visitors were asked to indicate their background and allow their location and download behaviour be tracked. Among 668 survey participants, the two largest groups were students (40%) and researchers (36%), followed by private citizens (8%), other experts (7%) and teachers (5%). Other identified user categories include journalists, civil servants, entrepreneurs and politicians. While new publications attract a considerable share of the views, there is still a relatively large interest, especially among students, in older materials. Our findings indicate that Finnish language publications are particularly important for reaching students, citizens, experts and politicians. Thus, open access to publications in national languages is vital for the local relevance and outreach of research.

AB  - With millions of research articles published yearly, the peer review process is in danger of collapsing, especially in "hot" areas with popular conferences. Challenges arise from the large number of manuscripts submitted, skyrocketing use of preprint archives and institutional repositories, problems regarding the identification and availability of experts, conflicts of interest, and bias in reviewing. Such issues can affect the integrity of the reviewing process as well as the timeliness, quality, credibility, and reproducibility of research articles. Several solutions and systems have been suggested, but none work well, and neither authors nor editors are happy with how long it takes to complete reviewing the submitted research. This panel addresses these challenges and potential solutions, including digital libraries that recommend reviewers, as well as broader issues like opportunities for identifying peer reviewers for scholarly journals by engaging doctoral students and postdocs, as well as those who recently completed their Ph.D.

AB  - Many open access journals have a reputation for being of low quality and being dishonest with regard to peer review and publishing costs. Such journals are labeled “predatory” journals. This study examines author profiles for some of these “predatory” journals as well as for groups of more well‐recognized open access journals. We collect and analyze the publication record, citation count, and geographic location of authors from the various groups of journals. Statistical analyses verify that each group of journals has a distinct author population. Those who publish in “predatory” journals are, for the most part, young and inexperienced researchers from developing countries. We believe that economic and sociocultural conditions in these developing countries have contributed to the differences found in authorship between “predatory” and “nonpredatory” journals.

IS  - 4
VL  - 7
AU  - Marino, Bill
C1  - Eastern Michigan University
AB  - The shift in scholarly communication from print to electronic format—and from ownership to access-based delivery models—has changed the dynamics of control related to library collections (Breeding 2019; Singley 2020). External providers now deliver most scholarly content to users, reducing library control to primarily print collections. User data gained through tracking technology, which often collects information without a user’s knowledge or agency, is a product of this shift that has been identified by previous studies (Hinchliffe, Zimmerman, and Altman 2018; Hanson 2019). This tracking data, aggregated by third parties who use it to form user profiles that can then be commodified, “challenges libraries’ historical assumptions about privacy and anonymity” (Hanson 2019, under “Aggregated Identities”).

AB  - Two different debates about electronic journals have been going on more or less independently, one assuming continuation of commercial publishing and the other advocating various free or inexpensive models. The provision of sophisticated facilities in commercial electronic journals is a major reason for the cost differences between the two models. Do users want these bells and whistles? Authors, not the readers or the buyers, are the key users of the scholarly literature, and authors want eyes, not pennies. If authors mount all their papers on their own web sites, commercial publication of specialised scholarly journals will be difficult to maintain.

AB  - You have probably heard about them: the <em>Directory of Open Access Journals</em> (DOAJ), <em>Directory of Open Access Repositories</em> (OpenDOAR) and now, <em>Directory of Open Access Books</em> (DOAB). The abbreviations pop up on familiar list-discussions and blogs. The services are mentioned at conferences, referred to in articles about scholarly publishing, and their data is used in research about open access (OA). You might ask yourself what all this fuss is about? Are these directories contributing to scholarly communication? If so, how exactly? This article argues for the value of the directories, mainly focusing on two of them: DOAJ and DOAB. It provides an introduction to the services, containing a brief history and status report, and addresses the differences between OA journal publishing and OA monograph publishing. It also highlights the value of these services and discusses whether the financial models behind them are sustainable.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the reasons for the high costs of scholarly journals. Design/methodology/approach A brief review of the literature on journal publishing costs is carried out. The paper focuses on the economics of scholarly English language journals published mainly in the USA and Europe, but which are sold worldwide, largely to academic and research libraries. Findings Journal literature has long played a prominent role in the scholarly communication chain. In recent decades, however, the scholarly communication system has been facing a crisis due to the ever‐escalating costs of journals. Two of the features of the journal publishing industry cited a decade ago and still valid today are a lack of competition and perverse incentives. “First‐copy cost” is reported to be the main reason for high journal prices both in print and electronic publishing. Originality/value The paper provides a useful overview to researchers and document supply librarians, enabling them to achieve quickly a clear picture of journal publishing industry costs.

AB  - Books are relevant outputs in research in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and need to be considered properly in research evaluation. Books are different from journals and the scholarly book publishing sector remains quite unknown within evaluation agencies. This paper describes the state of the scholarly publishing sector, beyond the large publishing groups and imprints, focusing the attention to the role of small- and medium-sized scholarly publishers at the national level. Bibliodiversity and multilingualism are essential values for representing plural and diverse SSH research. They are also linked to societal impact. Academic Book Publishers project and Helsinki Initiative are described to this regard. Finally, some remarks and recommendations for addressing the assessment of books are provided.Policy HighlightsSince monographs and edited books are essential communication media in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), they should be considered properly in research evaluation processes. Books are not outputs of second level in SSH research.Books are different from journals, which means that specific knowledge on the book publishing ecosystem and editorial practices is needed for addressing their evaluation. In this sense, it is important:Establishing stronger connections between the associations of scholarly publishers and research evaluation agencies.Boosting research on national academic book publishing landscapes.SSH research may be locally oriented and therefore published in national languages through national journals and publishers. Academic books should be evaluated considering this relevant feature of SSH research. It entails:Using complete publication data sources that reflect the diversity of scholarly publishers contributing to the dissemination of high quality research in SSH.Acknowledging the role of the small- and medium-sized, professional scholarly publishers which in each country take care of the publication of rigorous scholarly contents, closer related to local topics and written in national languages. Their role is complementary to that of the large imprints and publishing groups.Giving an adequate value to channels that allow for generating societal impact, especially to scholarly books (by local, regional and national publishers).Indicators can be used properly only if they take into account the diversity of scholarly publishers and the characteristics of the publishing landscape.

AB  - Electronic resources have hugely complicated the supply chain. Losing access to paid-for resources is common, and may be caused by miscommunication, lengthy reconciliation of payments to accounts, journal transfers and changing agents. There are many uses in the supply chain for institutional identifiers, and some of the new and developing relevant standards in this area are summarized. Being able to uniquely identify the institutions at each stage in the supply chain can cut down on access losses, and if libraries, agents, publishers and hosting services can agree on and implement a standard institutional identifier, loss of access may become a thing of the past.

AB  - Why Is Access to the Scholarly Journal Literature So Expensive? Bo-Christer Björk (bio) For more than 30 years the spiraling costs of scholarly journal subscriptions, often called the "serials crisis," have been a hotly debated topic. Academics and librarians have pointed out the high profit levels of the major commercial publishers, despite that the content they sell is provided by unpaid authors and reviewers. The publishers then resell it to the universities of these same authors and reviewers. Publishers have attempted to justify their prices by cost increases, their investments in information technology, and the value they add. A useful framework for understanding the situation is Michael Porter's five forces model for explaining the competitive conditions in an industry. Despite claims to the contrary, the degree of market concentration in scholarly publishing is not higher than that in many other industries, and it is not the main cause of the problem. But because the big deals of different publishers are complements rather than substitutes, the leading companies essentially do not compete for customers, in contrast to other industries, such as mobile phones or automobiles. The high barriers to new entrants, partly due to journal ranking lists and impact factors, as well as the low bargaining power of suppliers and customers, explain why this industry has been so well shielded from the disruptive forces of the Internet. The protected competitive position and high profitability are also major reasons why the big subscription publishers have been slow to adopt the open access business model. Background During the past three decades, there has been a continuing discussion about the subscription prices of peer-reviewed journals, which have risen faster than inflation. This phenomenon has been named the "serials crisis."1 Although publisher-wide electronic licenses such as ScienceDirect or Springer Link have largely replaced subscriptions to individual titles, the same price spiral seems to be continuing.2 [End Page 177] A related issue is the slower than expected transition to open access (OA) journals. Contrary to the early optimistic predictions 15 to 20 years ago, the growth has been linear, with a rate of only around 1 percentage point of the market share per annum.3 The major commercial publishers and learned societies have been reluctant to flip existing titles or start new OA ones. Instead, they have opted for the risk-free alternative of subscription journals offering paid OA for individual articles, a model called hybrid OA. University librarians and OA activists have spent much time trying to calculate "reasonable" journal costs and criticizing publishers for pricing leading to excessive profits.4 On the other side of the fence, publishers have tried to justify their prices by their high costs.5 The discussion has lately also concerned the pricing of articles in OA journals, so-called article processing charges (APCs).6 What many information science specialists and OA activists seem to ignore is that peer-reviewed journal publishing is a market like the trade in any other commodity or service. Despite that a large part of the raw material is provided pro bono by the academic community, scholarly publishing follows the same basic microeconomic rules of prices, set in an interplay between supply and demand, as well as the peculiarities of non-perfect markets characterized by oligopolies (a few big companies controlling the market). The so-called five forces model by the economist Michael Porter has for four decades been part of the standard curriculum at business schools for analyzing the competitive situation in different industries.7 The model is well suited also as a framework for a discussion of scholarly journal publishing. It offers plausible explanations both for the high pricing and for the slow transition to OA. The purpose of Porter's five forces framework is to analyze the key factors that together determine the competitive situation of an industry. The five forces that Porter claims define the overall level of competition are (1) industry rivalry, (2) the bargaining power of suppliers, (3) the bargaining power of buyers, (4) the threat of new entrants, and (5) the threat of substitutes. The model is usually visually represented in a figure where industry rivalry stands in the center and...

Beyond reporting relationships, physical collocation and joint strategic planning characterize the most integrated press/library partnerships. The main mutual advantages of deep press/library collaboration are economic efficiency, greater relevance to parent institutions, and an increased capacity to engage with the changing needs of authors in the digital age. There is emerging interest in collaboration at scale among libraries and presses that may extend the impact of press/library collaboration beyond single institutions.

AB  - PLoS ONE is five years old this month. Though still young in age, the journal has grown up remarkably rapidly, to the extent that it is now the largest peer-reviewed journal in the world. In the past five years, it has both garnered huge respect and support from authors, readers, and editors, and drawn the criticism and ire of many commercial publishers and establishment figures still fighting to maintain the science publishing status quo. Their fight now appears to be in vain, however: this past year a series of journals emerged that are very similar in scope to PLoS ONE (Table 1), suggesting that the landscape of scholarly publishing has irreversibly shifted. PLoS ONE clearly fills an unmet need in the world of scientific publishing, or publishers and scholarly societies wouldn't want to copy it.Table 1A sample of recently launched journals similar in scope to PLoS ONE.The success of PLoS ONE has surprised even us. The journal is now publishing about 70 papers a day (i.e., currently around 4,000 papers every quarter), and this figure continues to grow (Figure 1). If the trend continues, it will publish 14,500 articles in 2011: approximately 1 in 60 of all the papers indexed by PubMed in that calendar year will have been published in PLoS ONE. It has even attracted a new term—“megajournal”—to characterize it and the other journals of its ilk [1].Figure 1Publication growth of PLoS ONE.We believe its success relies on two features: trust and innovation. By demonstrating that open access (OA) is compatible with high quality and rigorous science, PLoS Biology, then PLoS Medicine and the PLoS “Community Journals” (PLoS Genetics, PLoS Computational Biology, PLoS Pathogens, and PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases) built a “PLoS brand,” making PLoS a trusted source of excellent science that authors and readers respect. As a result, PLoS could introduce a single key innovation beyond that of OA—one that represented a fundamental change to the traditional editorial model (and which has garnered awards from the Association of Learned and Professional Publishers [2] and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition [3]). All articles in PLoS ONE are peer reviewed, but editors and reviewers are explicitly asked not to assess the “broad interest” or importance of a paper, a criterion that provides the rationale for other journals to reject articles. Instead, any article can be published if it is technically sound, ethically and appropriately reported, and its conclusions are supported by the data. Thus, PLoS ONE publications include negative results, methods papers, and studies that replicate (but do not duplicate) others, as well as articles that potentially represent a major advance for the field. And because PLoS ONE covers all of science (albeit with a current focus on the life and medical sciences), and because the publication fee ensures that each article covers its own editorial and production costs, there is no limit to PLoS ONE's potential size beyond that of science itself [4].

AB  - When the Academic Council at Duke University adopted an open access policy in March 2010, they both enacted a legal mechanism for archiving scholarship in Duke's institutional repository and expressed a set of values in regard to access to research. From the legal perspective, the policy grants to the University a license to archive all peer-reviewed scholarly articles in the DukeSpace repository, which is managed by the University Libraries. That license is broad, but there were clear limitations on its implementation expressed by the Academic Council. From the point of view of values, this policy is a clear statement that research is undertaken for the benefit of society as a whole, and that improving access to the products of that research is beneficial to the researchers themselves, to the University and to the global community. This article explores the path Duke followed to develop and implement such a policy.

AB  - Key points Open research infrastructure provides the building blocks of scientific progress, which must be available to everyone, with no barriers to access. Organizations enabling open research infrastructure must endorse these fundamental principles: equity, value, trust, interoperability, sustainability, and community governance. Finding ways to invite co‐creation and community participation engenders a strong sense of ‘buy‐in’ and is therefore essential to developing successful research infrastructure.

AB  - Choosing a scientific journal for publication of research article or review paper is a universal problem faced by all scientists and PhD students after finishing his/her scientific research. Generally, the authors of pharmaceutical and medical journals are neither paid nor do they expect any financial recompense for their publication. What then is the motivating power behind researcher’s enthusiasm to publish their paper? It is possibly, the pleasure and gratification of being an element of the progression of pharmaceutical sciences and medicine through research and successive publication.Nevertheless, the true worth of a research deception is in its citation by other scientists after publication. Thus, the paper should be read by as several researchers as possible. The aim of this editorial paper is to talk about the significant reasons that the scientist and author should consider and judge while choosing International Journal of Pharmacology, Phytochemistry and Ethnomedicine (IJPPE) for submission and publication, so as to improve and increase the probability of acceptance to add value to their research and study, and most of all guarantee an extensive distribution and readership. Then why not submit and publish your best scientific articles in IJPPE and add value to your research and paper.

AB  - This essay comprises four parts, each by one of the co-bloggers at In the Middle (http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com). Karl Steel argues that the benefits of academic blogging outweigh its potential humiliations, and that academic conferences should post their papers publicly and allow for comments so that conferences, in a sense, never end. Graduate students and junior scholars should be encouraged to blog to help build a community and a trade in ideas, and to accustom them to the feelings of exposure and humiliation common to all writing, which will thereby train them to become more confident scholars. Jeffrey Jerome Cohen examines some of the difficulties posed by the age of e-medieval: an internet culture of negativity. Blogging entails finding strategies for managing harsh or off topic comments, as well as for coping with unwanted attention. Drawing on the pedagogical distinction Nancy Sommers makes between process and product, Mary Kate Hurley examines the role blogs might play in creating a communal space in which to share unfinished ideas. Blogs might be an ideal medium for the process of thinking, rather than the finished work of having had thought. Eileen A. Joy argues there may be more value in thinking and “working through” our scholarship online, in an “open” environment that promotes and invites democratic, catholic, and convivial support, as well as the accidental tourist and silent voyuer, than there is in the traditional “finished product” of a journal article or book. It pleads, further, for a better awareness of the fact that intellectual property is always co-extensive and communal.

AB  - Summary I describe a set of automated archives for electronic communication of research information that have been operational in many fields of physics, and some related and unrelated disciplines, starting from 1991. These archives now serve over 35,000 users worldwide from over 70 countries, and process more than 70,000 electronic transactions per day. In some fields of physics, they have already supplanted traditional research journals as conveyers of both topical and archival research information. Many of the lessons learned from these systems should carry over to other fields of scholarly publication, i.e., those wherein authors are writing not for direct financial remuneration in the form of royalties, but rather primarily to communicate information (for the advancement of knowledge, with attendant benefits to their careers and professional reputations). These archives have in addition proven equally indispensable to researchers in less-developed countries.

It might also sound familiar to subscription agents as they grapple with the demands from either side of the journal supply chain and the sometimes contradictory messages that come from their publisher and librarian colleagues. This article reflects on this potential ambivalence, why it exists and where it might lead.

AB  - Promoting journals managed in DOAJ, it provides convenience as a curated online directory a community that indexes and provides access to managed journals to improve the journal. The data available in DOAJ are independent, and this community service is believed to guide journal managers regarding DOAJ indexing. The problem is that many scientific journals in Indonesia have yet to be indexed by DOAJ, which DOAJ provides all content free of charge without delays or user registration requirements and meets high-quality standards. This community service method uses three stages. The first stage is the preparatory stage of team coordination to determine collaboration, resource persons, and preparation of activities and events. The second stage follows up the implementation with activities in the form of lectures, discussions, questions and answers, and practice which aims to build insight into registering journals with DOAJ. The evaluation stage is carried out by giving questionnaires to seminar participants as respondents to get feedback from the organizers. The results were that 86.96% understood how to register scientific journals with DOAJ. Thus, it can be obtained an overview of the level of success in implementing community service related to participants' understanding of registering scientific journals with DOAJ.

AB  - The African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development (AJFAND), is among the very few internationally renowned peer reviewed journals published in Africa. It was launched in August 2001, as the African Journal of Food and Nutritional Sciences (AJFNS) as a pilot project of the Rural Outreach Programme (ROP) by Hon Prof. Ruth Oniang’o. Its aim was to provide a platform, through which food and nutrition issues and information concerning Africa, and its unique problems could be effectively addressed and disseminated. A second objective of the journal was to provide a capacity building facility in scholarly publishing for budding African scholars. It became evident that these issues were also very closely linked to agriculture and human development in Africa. In recognition of this close linkage, the name of the journal was changed to African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development (AJFAND).

AB  - The majority of today's scholarly papers are authored in Microsoft Word. Some of those papers include simple and/or complex math. Authors have at their disposal multiple means to insert equations in Word documents, including several of Word's native equation editors and third‐party applications, such as Design Science's MathType . Building workflows that smoothly and accurately transform all of these formats into the appropriate XML markup for use in multiple rendering environments has many challenges. This paper clarifies the different forms of equations that can be encountered in Word documents and discusses the issues and idiosyncrasies of converting these various forms to MathML , LaTeX , and/or images in the JATS XML model. It also touches on workflow alternatives for handling equations in various rendering environments and how those downstream requirements may affect the means of equation extraction from Word documents.

Michael Casp, Director of Business Development and Production Services Coordinator at J&J Editorial, began the session with a definition of extensible markup language (XML) and gave basic visual examples of how it is both a human-readable and machine-readable language. This mark-up language is everywhere—even in Microsoft Word. His boiled-down definition was “XML is labels.” He went on to explain various versions of XML document type definitions (DTDs) and various ways to organize them, such as NLM, JATS, and custom DTDs for content management systems. Journal article tag suite (JATS) is the most commonly used DTD for scholarly journal content; it has become the de facto XML standard in the scholarly publishing industry. Casp also discussed how peer review systems such as Editorial Manager collect metadata from authors and editorial staff and then convert them to XML files for transmittal. Afterward, a manuscript document is tagged either before or after copyediting, mostly via automation with human review, to create a new XML file of the text, tables, and metadata; as he noted, almost every item relevant to the […]

AB  - One year of russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine to seize its territory and destroy the Ukrainian people as a nation, its language, culture, scientific achievements, and educational traditions have demonstrated the incredible adaptability of universities and their libraries. This paper aims to analyze the administrative aspect of the urgent adaptation of library teams of Ukrainian higher education institutions to martial law conditions in the example of the Scientific Library of the Ukrainian State University of Science and Technologies (USUST). The paper considers the experience of survival, resilience, and adaptation of the USUST library to the war, which can be extrapolated to other libraries of Ukrainian higher education institutions. In addition, the study comparatively analyzes quantitative indicators of five university libraries as of January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023. The main vectors of library activity are distance, openness, unification, and improvement of the single information space. The primary motivating factors for librarians’ resilience and adaptation to wartime working conditions are belief in the Armed Forces and the victory of Ukraine. The study emphasizes the importance of university libraries’ support of open educational resources as one of the methods of overcoming the Ukrainian linguocide. Library directors in wartime, with predominantly female staff, note the impact of psychological factors on their professional activities. Despite the threatening trends, libraries continue to support educational and scientific processes in their universities, launching new directions of activity.

Their responses highlighted a dynamic research environment in which individual researchers desire to connect with other experts, yet often remain isolated within their departments. Common challenges included dealing with data storage, management, and preservation, as well as understanding publication impact and dissemination methods. Respondents looked to KU Libraries as a neutral entity that could connect them to experts, materials, and practices that would enhance their research.

AB  - This opinion piece argues that the time finally seems right to truly embrace innovation in the academic publishing market and review the role of large commercial publishers therein.It argues that many innovations already exist but have thus far failed to truly disrupt the status quo due to the omission of due consideration being given to the broader role of scholarly communications within the wider research ecosystem and an inability to compete with the least tangible of publishers' value propositions: prestige.It does this by conducting two analyses: a stakeholder power/impact matrix to ascertain all who have an interest in the scholarly publishing process and their primary motivations, and an exploration of the value conferred by commercial publishers to the publication process.It concludes with a call to bring together all impacted stakeholders to issue a declaration on fair publishing and a commitment to change.A collective approach, united by a common purpose, can lead to real change for a better, more equitable future.

This place enables the creation of a multimodal publishing environment that fully integrates digital content with manuscripts and “traditional” scholarly content. Starting with an overview of the history of the team that devised this approach and its membership, the article describes the problem that the authors have identified with current approaches to multimodal publishing and outlines a workshop model for engaging in a reconfiguration of the publishing process, including a description of a new publishing and knowledge making ecosystem that includes librarians, publishers, and other collaborators.
